A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0xC7D4C7AB23F387F6442762E21714E097
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x5A945826D741712AA0EF2C2F05DADFF6
miscellaneous remark.
0x33BB56BEF9579504176BEB24B424C025

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x9C6A9C3DA0771A7CD59855EF9D9BB245

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x8402F8FB4E85402A460DC88F0DDD2FC8
few pretensions.
0x943085F796B91570F6A318DC1E6C820E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x72C328C1EC41F546966D0D72101236D5
obscure aspirant.
0x18CF07F53204687CFC0B185AE02D4CCA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x6A33ADFF72DD51B38AB4030A2F444981
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x4A5B5F1B313333CEAB1381EC99115A29
Author.
0xAF38A820EBF3D7858CF51ACB06F96F79

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x2787055BE17E33EFA9E0ADE0A2544D89
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x8DD138D864C8A7953D2E05FA37A2D4DC
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xE36947F679B38AE7FF7B18D386A40523
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0xA3100EEC0553CA11F1F142E154340B61
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x506966573156A6019DAEBBCA8035BC65
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0xAC7ED00292985A9071927E81C3F54FB1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x064CC9309A2B838EB05710C9417F8351
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xAF2CFFFD55CD1D7152D9FAB24E89AE12
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x66708C57FD96D1D0A42B3ADB9CA9857A
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0xD7DF10BAB4C03DF87246DB607B8F1E1B
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x5B94C4032DB49DBC4A0833BAA89D5A22
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x2830D726AC46BA38327EF72FE73911BB
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x5CCC2109EBF6A2BE38028D455B3A9334
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x3F4FACF0403E5C5CA08A7719E7AAC8A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x67AB9A6F1140A476D54FAC2E6B83C041
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x7F760A7454043FE4E3C946FEE4891F89
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x209915FD4F39D0BAF5A2DD402E9FC728
Thorns.
0x0EEBB8BDC6781620ACC4B9C79A6CF963

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0x73EF873987F5E60766389327D9CF5C4C
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0xEF744C9CBEC7404215228AD64EE2C144
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0xAD111D8C0189CF32E6476A4A0E18E370
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xCE552EA5DA64AE5DAE5FAC593F827D5A
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0x90AF8CC25CAC42F10A82D3E9BB6B4376
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xD04931C43C1FC331D4248C6A181AE162
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x6664B3C42423F29D26FE683241395149

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0xFF79BEA98161A88C2880CDD18719D103
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x57F48FAF717413AD83DD663D0D4BC4EC
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xEABEC87BD4F8B1F263A2AE1FC988EF6E
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0xCEF1F6C2BA120A0A527FA62FDC1DE9A0
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0xF0CB44000E28EE012B89EE4395FB9E75
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x287708F64890954A74D8D6DB07A3CC1A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x07E24EAC6E36E881740F2B413801A1EF
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x4077335272EA2D8E29D0E425EF06B64E
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xCA72F97CC4FB3F43F7FB95459BB98C7E
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0xBC63324B492A5401E3AB11CC6ABAA4CF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0xB261DF30E41FE0D271AAC5F27B98A165
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0xFFE783A61BA71182CDD260101C160093
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0xAFD6757379951C4525F4FA9E9673552E
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x68169DBBBB13FCEC573210433D8AD454
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x95AAF4FD94D2DF6A52BC79DA92146EB7
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0xB3550D73D0E41FD529B2A3F63B6DCCC8
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x0312796B956370F0EDC0DC9AA345AF02
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0xAAF7B83BB6AEB04015222C6974622748
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x2828D36E7F8CB868BEC7BEE884FB7C75
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xC2F0B61550AB262ABD0A660913A12123

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0xB368F93C6864159FB50E8DA80A8929C8
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0xB7482F85396A23D6104CF329756E5891
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0x05CC51477AC78A92CC0101FEFA0AFC61
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xA5E4DB0DCEDCECAD275CE90FADE5C462
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x222D2E05D9E0BA0DC3F78CE8C06A37DD
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x3E7A093B8794286EE8305CD26B5297A6
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x45D2A218EE778E9D95C7A76630899880
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0xBC1AA634CDCA2E1AA9FCBFFBE287A59A
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0xE8B5A5DC996A99021FE70AC9D19BA106
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x4EA02FF8BF2DA833188F03B58186C6D1
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xCEC39B675CC549C9D2613106C3C5EA49
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xF999F496E4DCB280E9FC31DE98785AEC
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x91513D456A2668B883AF2975DD1969E7
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xD6C3D950D93039A974F44C8BC06590EB
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x01E16168003799AB04793BF9BC3B81C0
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x820694CB84D978423D778A9E6983DD5B
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x67A3549CC30279E47D6355FB9350BF57
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0x2DF14037E2B0FF6870F8F1A5F36946E5
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x69822D83E043EF814679B8208268C343
denied where it is justly due.

There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x8150A100414D390CE72B8A8871D8F4BF
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x1FE21ED700F15BF7ED7FA06797F71ED0
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x9F2AB974D4DFAC313A1F0505BC3DC6A1
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x230A943097288A65A4FCBAF47268F1E9
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0x40EA8BC0AE0CFD6F85136ADD24E192A6
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x40456EE0A67686FFB43F752EB5E1FF22
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0x1949994FE40DD1F688C2C646F7DA616B
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x4B9FF387D652B577975611C3A3C92A87
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xCE9DB5A7823F2AC5A56AFAF85DD56262

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0xE18C7798F0DB658086A3842957252B18
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xB09AE2626495B70B07E46CFD3322BB14
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0xDE78A79B67CBF9FEFF94770194712C2F
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x7125A1CCA9D29FEA8B599263F0E3741B
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x32542BD9D343F607B56C7B5A00534F9D
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xDACCC2619BCEFB75C5234C743BBF6329
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x250284E02012061CE8E55EA135B683CF
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x20C4C956566B36C6395909F4453BD7E0
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x0D00EB26851C421C42B6620B3D427529
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x977DD4C0D384F67B0EB17F73FAABE6EE
little children."
0x6775850E7860A516717C3A9B78946D33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0xAB84D6D7374A25639FBCE0A32F1D7AA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0xFEF67C22FFCC56CE3273E59594503454
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x6C1337A071806A7ED678B8DA361E9EC8
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x051E5617543741BE0211B5F8CAEF29DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0xD3162700A5505C37061FACE4E11AEAE0
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0x25FB78249906CE3FEBAD018C2E85C47A
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x9F6CD16CE0B3751F6B0A9CC1785FB936
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x76214DC078721480EDBC83FEBCBC91C1
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xFAA7B4A7D354E576A682CD59D80EE378
retirement.
0x965BF8B633391152B08C972EA94D7C22

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0xD92E80BFE5156131B627CEF5C35E8E64
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x716E6BBF163353BD48DE36E5DAECA03B
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0x0C07852F6BA943CBEDB87961C2A4CA51
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0x955752A1A4A4A03BB10128E2E2F66D86
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0x7E7BE8D37A8987E239779CE84E30EA2A
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x71FC2CC16F4665B735A517CD69BC1077
lamentable blast.
0x65C07B847F6683CE1E45607531456946

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x60251ADBCF43926A989A240D1B98999F
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0xCA4532AE71754FE48A37ADE2EA3F17FD
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0xA1446D0BC0AD882BD048D068D36475BD
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x7FC1E9483E4EDADD3B9E829E1974A155
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0xFDF7573E3F7C024CE5A4DC99BA92B431
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x94FA19E69397294F3C27F4EA27BFB037
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xEF0763DE34C8E22564C2D2700C11DB2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x0A2944FD77E9EE197E9FA0BDB708DA22
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0xD00451AEC106AB4BEAD7DDF411472846
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xDF156666C79572923769DD0A3E4AD994
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x57C057F72CC368C21E694C9F0CE4310D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xC884CB2E7DDE521333205316D47AB2D5
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x8D7BF656375C91BAC8B8F00533F499DE
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x3EE1C8D18803C42D469FE77A6AAECB86
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x4BFC2CE6C619F929E66371E23AFBB83C
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0xAE00B809A4A5D9C66C22312DEAC5F5F7
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x86E9C43F339CB8F1AE4E7DAAD7573E0D
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x62AF4E41E3A46A59629EAE2088DDD1EE
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x1B768F37D62935649B5C9F54ECE5AEC1
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xA5829E7CA87FD0ADBD3DFD917C4BB567
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x6401C3E963BAFAC755876A0DDF606897
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x07ACC5A876AA91B53F8A5E48D0D8703A
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x15424F5C64313273861504DA3DF933B4
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0xA98F16D5EB87FD124EBA20EEBA9BA0E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0xE79D99268332313A8AEE74BA8F01F84D
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x403E6CC6B876137620B8123ABD5598A8
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x0D2DF973430D593B399AF4252CE397C6
hour of eventide.
0x524D4A35AC9E72CDB434AD7C9CC8ED75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xEBBC95DADC29D9423FDE7997347A8D99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0xF4CEE1CD5978E35780C3ECBB52FDA0EC
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x5CE1490025EF5E6DDC23BEE5505AB940

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x12CF1BBB8FDE12A55BD0503B3419C99B
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x00BBD8B3B9EEA3D9271B1D66F6A07D3A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0xB7530EF50565E1C218D17C4567806B19
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x814081F62AE64C8830B480C98360B51F
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0xD38F83ADA6C2EB77FCE47339BC402EF0
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0x4D519049D76C1D7BC90A74493A235EE2
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x9E64AF7844FE234866046403FA898A3E
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0xE4B595179C4E0FA1D0E00E6D0ECE25FC
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xE18A57BAB87493326CAD68845167A261
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0xD9875BE6BBED46DAEA525605B5582FFC
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x62A91555FCFC7196BFADF5F8A193B35D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x5117850B25CE7D31D0FCF2CEDB4DF4C3
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x4D7EA6EB9247CCFEFA100A43590AC068
room door opened.
0x9366DAA444896E048AA7AC8F74183A55

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x3B0F83B42D57EABD51E8065341890A3A
found the room apparently empty.
0x2F042ED1CC27CC368BEEA367ADDA4874

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x73EA128EEC408B85F57F66AFD27CEA61
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x5BCEC250D8FBE5BFFA5FF2BE26FEB0B4
animal!"
0x126B230BFF8CB08A5575BFD4CA42CF6F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x724F5F2D753D08C974BA0EDB3E0F85A1
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0xB049F0A61CD3D6EEA3F874800AC34759
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x1F83F2D36E6AC96B41D79A2BC687CEF1
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0xB26F9ADE116B9C9D5FDF165EE05FCC1B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0xEEA8491A0924C4FDDBB55F7D4E7743D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0x00A70DE65FA377E22826E0350D35FD79
forth by the said Jack.
0x87533AE0D390321C96FCC9A47081BCF5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0xD2B6389C0402A9C74D825B02692C22BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0x72E68C25536D16E6EB8AB8F82721FAFA
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x351A3D2DE9F28A78C8838B637567C9D1
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0x1F35ADDF2F2E16B2D931A7C786C01222

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0xCBFA1F023BAC7CA243E22C7334AAB86C
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x37F8BF3496FDA273CF2B5AC6E35807C9
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0x5E5097365AF0EE27E7DF848C53AF905E
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0xE650886A5CDD7A189DBC7D2BAA641BD3
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x6B630F478EBAAAA89738DFCC4DAD12A9
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x21F75290FEA301081B2B8EC8877617E3
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x43F3F1C584733326096FD81B1C78DBB9
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x2185F02290DEEA6D417E5E587893BEAB
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0xE0B215F26ECC1C40059F09670F537516
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xC4641DED7C6DA7F631FDF21364AFEA89
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0xB9A9E1F905A7E46BF0A22B851DCC67A9
home.
0x3B92720E7F557D8A5455F03CAFF4CF58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x1D393A40C57CB9A71C92B405D5FD0148
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0x5044F46AB53F184BA4CF098A76146C28
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xA1BEFB52ADA32EBFBD59332538976C60
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0xB75F9A048B53B6CF3EEF6F711FF358D6
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x514A0D2A55A084559C803CD2B1ED4DAA
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xD873EE586EF71E87DD25C969DCD2FFE8
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0xF4DA437B6AF1EF68479C9753ACDEDF23
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x9B4DBA68681DDCE43E8B8B010AC7D6E5
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x513F3372BC6360C4585B6C5F102FBE5D
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x2098593E7E27EA3591404A3494B9F12A
her back.
0x854CCBF0B41CE95D8D089B3C22C5C4C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x9ED93B5090F7A88F214EA554F0993C1D
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xDD1B473367F7226890C71FB0A2051F12
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0xCE2C9F8A669006E524EA01161F8FFAA2
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x9DFCE67780E5686A2EC4621FF84499FD
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x3617546EFE4CA0079340ECA74A6F9BE1
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x121FD8C240DC7287E85109A7CBE25AC2
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x5331761F25E30A81B0016E1B377F1965
chair.
0xB92FD70C6ACF25A5B0879EEA74545AD3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x946EFFC4595E79F74D31D30B4A06D192
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0xA7451F304DEE648234C9E718AFB396A3
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x7DEA7BD4B73B3FBE12028AC0DBC3F81C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x8F6D77F64EDF3AF744C07C9F16B432EA
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0xD34348777574D4F0BCD8A2A54CD8C8F7
insult.
0xE26BDC660C36118BA8EDCE653F9B83E4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x84DDA19DB3F91C25FDA6ED9659130867

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was reading."
0xBB5DE155C6D9788CEDA00CCBCBB05AA4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Show the book."
0x3E9948BABE385077965B9DEEEB962376

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0xEF8319E8B32678FD08F055E0D5EEEC3D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x82315FD181D8105A1A3049902F039E78
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0x00A7AECC965A4FCD272EFAC83B47C4B5
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0x636E09ED99933708C09E9E382D1093FD
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xF80E0F084B6778EC559CB3A978FBE1C6
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xC1CD130556CE59E04A1FA48CFB5428F3
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xC7C571672DCE1A30F8AA1BAAAFA9120D
the mirror and the windows."
0x284AA4772FDEC9F8956860F16E81A8FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0x0E3F8B4102AD94BE636ECDEEB0972ABF
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0xA92917C418BFE5D46D715DC9FCBAD395
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0xACF03149F6B1CCEBB2B2A65986DBC647
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x4F900D1AE4B9E49C6B414671FEE62E30
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xC0E1333EBA9515D4AAF87CCAC0F6ACF9
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x00D5DBD90F53AB13EB4DFC341FED0DBA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0xAAD2DF520DDD608FBB5C3CAB60878E2E
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x323EB2286EC051B28D53A739759DEF22

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0xCFE6B40C254DE7887E0E552CDAF75E4B
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x34863D6426400FC7B4D159501D6BDF7A
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x439A44A08245421F2FBF9890C9A479EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x7659487D7B6D389083DD0F5E8D1CC6C9
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xC48A87DB213D94EAFDF9F14C5745F9B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x288F26EB64056D29508230BB5A700B54
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x977BDD42BD3A8AAE876226D6FC0A07F4
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x148BE704FCF2DB3D66AD03DFAFDC9BB8
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0xAAF586EC9376EBF666507D67C9509091
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x11C68B6DC3BAED0E5134F88744B1F3BE
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x8108EBD8031F6C9E2D32869D9F675435
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x571851298A10ECD714F32356FB1477A7
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0x1668692964F6DD92F00E85FD31E703A7
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0xA8AD61EE7D262B47A673ABE2F6068334

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xD3ABCAABBA06B3078211560E1622B1DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0xA7E70AB6EF30215D0948D1C5B3BE67BA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x19880ED56B7388BBCD56734A75358F1D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x7CF28E5092A19405B47034A2D82FB205
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x22938A29C0483C5CF29DF94C88067EA7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
CHAPTER II
0x24FFCEB3EBD96192B2347E9F10AA00CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xAD716D00A51B0866ED3C6FFB79D7983F
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0xB8EB9C6541704B9F7AAC965D6361FA95
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x4A1898C8FC7A08F2A8C49A66FE821171
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x1091F4397FC13E0C616FCA5A213F0C6E
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x3633A2F8F1DB01BC0BE34702CC5D5362
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x41978773B9BCB0B3F1864E617328920E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x0F3D4436C8B39122EB1668721516F5B1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x478A5EACE84A7BD12102868D9A25E286
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x67442AC2F55EAE9D05A36E07DE1020B7
young master."
0xF9275CA257A22F5096D24AB25015F11F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x8E3C5969CCAA9D529C329498F09E15F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x87B24A74A1CF4743F96ABBE1500A79CD
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x2C70D79197DDA32420771806CBE23B94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x86346D4E79580620C3C379B502731449
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0x8A90E4339A0EDB958D4D436752421870
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x2488C2A363A6A50FB9355558666DE0B8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0xBDDE25A6AA4735282A2BF21E9ABB9D94
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x3DD389B923824DAAD0834D9E0C7CC7DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x420451A4F7B03A5D4CE75FBA8557B894
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0xBF5762F3CB68E63844C4B97F16E03DC5
little of the excitement out of me.
0xB91CE3C9CEBF6E6F5E0070CD24C7C418

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x89A9CD16301718E2A8FFC0E56234B8AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x8050BB4DAEB4E952091E4DCD318B441E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x1D1B9973356F701C1A5F4B99642A753F
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x7322D8E87ED4033BE6E1540DF38975A5
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0x25FB4DABA0D2C90DF6F59E919DE01A88
incredulous of my sanity.
0xE51B4C5BD51E19934DBC15856C374236

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x99E1612ACE1BCF8E1ACFEC958C8A4167

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x95DE936E7D74C686E8187A25B8D8EEB9
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x11F21E73F39ED4AD64C93D063D71B27B
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xCA6D3E1133DBFF7D1AD31CF3068E8738

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xBD292C8941D9A7BF98C6BB227033C695
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xFA5C85AA3DCB7F350ECA4B052341BAA6
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x6F722665A7F59A099CD42DED22DFC6F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x58BAB150556286B1FD4679E032AF6572
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xE64DF45A9FDFD4F85984F1B81CD12913
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x7F0E9817EF827729BEE899BB777988F3
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0xA2B1DF2DCA148C299E87605D0704D29F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x146BBA011EBF8EF7DC4150E21B422E58
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x194AFB9F7C7DF1FCDE34DE2EED37389C
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x7375E5D2F7D2C417FE8E3F60A5B14358
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0xE74932675C675662A0F3F67BB7A17952
them."
0xD8B5BC9A9AB7BDDE595F3219FA998F8D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x9D4FB0777395DD3D708938E126B56B5D
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x81FFEDED8D9A394AE90FB476DC759949
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x3A8F38CAA3B49004A8827D0BFDE1AF15
away, I am sure."
0x87C82D8A893CF2F3EB1E121EF3E4428F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0xE22CD1666E47B620CFBEEF13EB7CFD3C
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xB10CC7864CC89B1999434F058CE117D8
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x7D50DE7EBCCBE4FE90B0D9345A637837
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xDB12B283336017E77B71D18567D3B325
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0xF6866EBE80516F17CC87B758AA22AC7B
fetch you away."
0x4D60DDF827995B2C348BB31D55DC70B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xF29332E5385F397EB36EA7C685855814

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x38590AF9334B223ADD1F8658FFB26FEE
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xA4263F8F12FA23D953556FF3D464FD53
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x9201FE74CA59D46B456A8EF34E7A70DA
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x1F310B8B7EBE8C1ECCE83EE8C4F78D58
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0x9B38BA2BFD1050CE67B669F004600F76
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x1EA72FFA3739DE1AC37A1011C7577CA9
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x258905C37C1CDDDA08A13856DCB3DA8D
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x856BF4F6308E9A11400E31A76529DAF4
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0x6A4410AA5F0AB8E89182E590266BB78A
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x8EA84B27733ABA99500CB22B1182E587
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xC4866AA2F560E9B6B448D8B2815F7822
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x543EC780B4597C1F7D40D8B8FC9D2702
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x26A034886C81150624C431191916F3E2
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0xA2C72CEC09C70A99FC9A3D51B6714501
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0x7C385D65D687585971FB29473C198642
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x74EB593A9C312ACF82163AA58A7247B1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x24920982272166B22B5ED10B665616F3
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0xEB2C701B9538F8D310363CFAF2C867F1
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xB049EFEA4FC22DC5F1B95A6191D6325B
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x1E6FA2D5D0670B5BFBC860DAFEE820F9
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0xC915A7001B2C410FD20ECF383F41FD2D
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0xD6BBD1E9356C84F00981EF2F1F810959
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x25413F421603871CE50ACDB2A2C6EE77
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x749F215E724C2E595B9D90CF143FBE6C
in spite of its grandeur.
0xEDC5F59FB2354E30D9B21AF4E6DE8078

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0xDE87510EA24C0C77872C01549C26CCAD
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0xB04E5307D79A014EDE7D125AE157D4E3
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x9AFD5BC26A35203B7BCDEB6FABB7ABFA
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xD70AD1B5E36F882C7317A5104109CD32

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0xD2AF0739D610D2221465C36D223E983A
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0x226417D2ACF84BE5D54F1BFC2F17DE6F
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0x0733DDDF220C51602FC6CBA42AA1098D
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x14641061755CA492A9E3F2EC588404F9
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xC4216A6CDB00C9A3D7F0DFAD902AE688
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0x2585B41B1C9764C06AEA0BD4F02D24E3
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0xB37744AA541760C98D4535E9CE877BBE
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x75FD154605B0C5A6E9BD975F8B1E755F
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0x5AD0844592DA839A17717E7C037BBA05
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x757F70386CF3FD4FAD2A2453D97957C4
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0x235E926E10A60A30FE3431F004A5841A
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x69DDC1039F21E79EFAE3D64F8ECDC9D6
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0xF102BEF8C5DD4C7B80C49DF5FD69824E
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x299859DD51D44F826BBD469932D712BF
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x6A8939682A08FE8A3BDF7935A3CBF58E
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0xA4CF19E3ABC77E51383DAF865A9B3371

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x8789470783EFCDABF1341B05AD4BCE8A
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x279091CE6D3995D049B9E8CA43FAEA31
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xD4F1927BE037C52F574E3C1F40F1FF79
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x409B7FEDD5D853E3D7EE88C18AD87365

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0x728E5FD1B8963768E5ADF7224B54EC9A
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x8E0E6E43659756CEEF4CC79FF63FB2A2
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x3A3364A321447690DB9CF1BD05E3D0FE
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x1A81F814FC17A7EBAE0AD528ACA5CA17
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x6EC9EF863626480CF3F099F231E32C03
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x719767EBE54706793E5CAE41682D9058
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x0330C3639696CE4AF7CF6FF67FAB42CD
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x532E212D990D6D27CAD28FBD22BB1BB7
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0x6E1B381E98162ECA9B46D14BB54DE26E
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x566351751A0D0D7568E3BB78E0B8FC26
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x1109EF2AD437CCE666403DE3FD44CF04
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x79E71D79EF0C25C232A4585B9F147FFC
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x568B616DD68AD9E826B71C2B784F4201
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x8F27AFFC956B79B082DA3995E5F16C5D
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x78A4A4429C74F1778CE1513ED3B0F53F
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0xD4B6B8D07D2FF13B51D9FF64CAD45B27
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x474458FABE8D22FE3E98E8727830B93A
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x3BAD93DAF55B2F2C70139F0548781A39
night.
0xC1D9478C440596978E7D5378F4747652

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x0A0DDA83E90ADED877E59A9B26F0A579
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x497DD7048CC5C2D03A6C308A4346E662
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x15F61660407425F110EE3C554CCBC12E
general opprobrium.
0x2DB3DFAE02D230F231747E14AD0C16CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x8C0CEA0B678D5CAFCA642D7ED9A4A9E7
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0xE15DB7DE593459749A1DDE0ED0BCF2B9
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x9D57AF9EDEA130D05B4BF3F637ADA1CD
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0xA051B3CA2E650AA479E3F770992A89BA
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xA4A4E304D2B6AA9AD81080FAB6B6F152

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x21FD559633A712635FEE3D04F851F15E
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xF5B1219C18BBE48E5F469A3A4D749A01
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0xB22680AC6A2F7CD783FE090E05F8A76B
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x74CF75673F7180FCCD1E380B3A9B8926
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xF5DDD45DD29C71A830CCA3F7ADA5566A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0x3BEC07E0831289CE664B84BFC8474C16
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0x48CE038D5E3404DEFC4B2926DF283F8E
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0x924E83BB2372F77423F259ED257F5E58
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x5BD098B636C6EF57E24160B92734C10A
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x40FCBC121DAB0F82DA4FE983A09099ED
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x8B4A0A9B582D8607D4893B7E42A5DB14
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x09913309409A316630B4A31CC5FD4FC8
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x20BD7707314A34FF686E69E8712B0505
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x768678F0E500A280C97A1096A2232257
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x31BED4EDD392297D64A4A6A03A4457F7
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0xD7E392D37EC78B7E5BEC46825BE5264F
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x3A103778F53793FB180AA860EE8F4A99
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0x8A94CF0C3D9CD2B6E604A7B445FEA2B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x3EF071FA1985DC12D924EE1ED497094F
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x1D2EFE3BAE1ABA0FCFA72CF6CD46D42A
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x9D54AD1920AD84439A69C9AAC792E75D
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x3625C3F1FA3153CFD27F9BA034A48EE7
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0xF67795B0F21C184E6BAB1B94D0FA2BFD
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x7F03750B9ED400DBB6FD34F7999D4E4E
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x67AD10166E94E6CB893608FA17D46548
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x2291DC6FBB19FE4CA06011C0AC287634
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x33B6C87111CC13C0E0B2175DB5393D6A
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0xF919BE0034D45575ADC1F3A36BD43DFF
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0xE3904B35DF01167E59CB630AB21A3845
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xA67FE437C0FCEB96314C3A02F66DB4C3
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x81D6B3FA074365CB09EFD3D5569A7AF8
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x0420EA5FE2EDCC5B96175D837F94F110
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0xC9D9B5C4E484AC517BD2DE52742B7223
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x99F980B8CB5DEA646300DCFB7FD2F8C7
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0xC020D0C319A5F069ACE83A9DF70ABFB1
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x59741D9E4438C20CA5365B41FD12EF9B
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x139278C2BF32DFF754A479BAE651C4BE
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0x880DC6D761FD9C0BDAC62B9EA6F88495
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0xFBC45D6516D2B7FFA06DE43B96B3381D
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0xFCBDB9BB4D42A50A0F9EAB1048B9C257

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x3B8DF86CE5212A9D90E3E9C619834530
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xCE240BFF6E1CADA46EC8F133B8BC111E
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x24B0A59966E6F37D526566942291863B
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x9ACC2AC8C5E9F25F877CC7152B0083DF
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x1C5F72E537E33931C3E5A3B979659108
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x77ED28F71B087E1D2A5199769D9F7396
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x6567AA9F799CCA4EE5834A1C7DB99E5C
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x20D84C568EC0E7D19D632BB1EB7091A7
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x5E3875C5E95272879BD6CB7632BB01AF
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xF306BEFE521F9E5047E59BAA22B1D8A0
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0xB1D7E5B7B9E34EBAA7127BF8DDFE6541
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x307E3B1364EBFC40436452F50AECB8EA
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x2E1667A98150C8E8085E58C7C96D279E
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0xC37490D9D556FD0FFC62CB7E6140C4A3
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x8D9A018020D45D86127006BC9311F1AA
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0xC16EBFD439FF4977DD3C3E576A6410AC
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0x90F773AAB675E9E6C27ED0600A0D0EDC
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x6F67245459805E9B069EE64029DEC256
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x2CACADDE5EF03B2F3A13352972438A9B
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x8B6AC6B8E025E5E6255D53B5373B4419
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x8EA5FF3F218BC69CBEBAD35EF5DCFE02
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xD3A4EDE1AC706BBBB80D25445A89D28D
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0xB23DD9C4C3E8E0BFF463783F1EDADAC1
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xA75AEE1D78AAB24DD383B9749CEC6FA2
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x789BA761B41DC2C50F6201CCCBD09D55
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xD8A8363DD89DE350A8B2122F9A6B323A
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0xE46E1DDA49A5AEEB43BBFB22B386223E
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x20E905601025AFDDA949BA9257FE3E78
Abbot entered.
0x43AD396B8F945EDC1D96FB077C059DB5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0xED1C15DF55DB10547F467EF4326C6B25

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x4ECDB0EACB3916BE80A47804260BEAB5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xB4B5970DD78B33570BA7B28B26710738

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xD1E033E731B5C19EB5E34A37534393A1
Bessie.
0xD2D644DDD1F3E2A6FC2F5791D357FBB3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0xF5492688B0B5A83CA25878CFAE9544E2
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x0D94FBCB986B0E77E085E609CBD3F10C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0xB3533AAD74816573F93B2A735E33CE98
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0xEFE0F87076D84D4C788238F01C059054
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x78914FC72E0A87A6BCDF3F1E472BEC8F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0x6D6386EC083C130E1F24E7EDD3174E21
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x241D343E5AD189985B93AFBD16559229
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x7B094FC296CA7238D4518843F589AAAC
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x9F51F19A22C951998BABFFDFF07EAEF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xFB5457B0FB9CA59C7CD754A8BEB76DF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0xC46EEB8B71D74501AA898B6E0C2FEC4B
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x7AC5466693EB3C6D5D4DE212C4BED5A9
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0xF3D3AEDF3988D598894DAA07CE3061DE
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x5D8BFC2C603E20BD0B77ABA7A2183391
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x34C72FBEC4CA3EC636F7D6557FEBE3BF
then."
0x453FCDC1241447FC246D3FC6C0A24CB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0x5C70AEF46740FDAB1C4B957BF6A7861D
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x29A362283B29F38E25DB275E4696D504

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x68B749C91ADB0820A717ECAE700F5F87
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xE4BE7AB6F1C527D620903AC0AE071B3E
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x881320CD55A51B968A4F8AD820362B84
duplicity.
0x9E1F6E762F610BBF1BE39BDC0B62E4CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x3C6DAAA1F930919223B8047EED95ABC3
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x93B5CB40050F265DF5EAC44A0CCC3E98
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x34E3D514D9AD2050A25C73ED82C3FC04
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.
0x2AF97D372388492F340AC615CA0C3B77

CHAPTER III
0x305FF047D9D753A23BBB63758781A2CF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xC40C6F642E8097DEBC2904B991AD2E32
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x7314DF662D2DB9E270074F8B8339700F
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0xB41B2EF5EA6CD0AA2F6103A4F33DF068
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x4E34E6F25DCECD2A9A97DADD7D8FA204
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x582690FA8952EDA9312B5AAE84E698FB
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x915CD8725E83C2C6354BA3D66C6B4C7C
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0xA043C867195050A5F4D63D7B19C43FAD
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xB21FC70CA668A84F6A76905109086194
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xDE1661465EA4961A2865ADEC6479252F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0xC8E0B178676EE93C993BA000760E3FAE
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xCB56FCA606FB1682B42D4DF81B184C16
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0xBB1208C02A00E9C107DF3F76BC31145C
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0x98E030AFAA8E91BFF37FBA8424D4B2AF
pillow, leaning over me.
0xE5D7463037E285FEB9C407BE7B9CA9FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0x9E21FA7F059D1EF896064191D9935BE1
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x0F3B8679C05FA9FA3670EA652781CA37
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0xA05FF82BBA15B97B330E736B7BC02CC1
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0xD43FD23CBD0FD22733733D75D92B89D7
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0xFA0550A8AAF008055C04FDF0C3A3A701
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0xEF863AA319C1BA19821396BCA86CE761
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for

herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x9FBB1675B14F54431E333DB732C52012

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xC3B2A3C2B6453DBEAFC119347CAE2F0B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xFB540060BF7F388B634F164677011AE3
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x831861781DD6E8D2A22734DA7165818B
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xC7EE63B7488D38AE2E36B69E724D2644
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0x1C39382739DC446FB5FF3B30F6177377
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x3A13473DE77D8FCA1B8AC7E3B4373D4F
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x6A2B0601FA18C02B714D0EDD6674768B
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x1C21775D80CCF01A54DBEB4885D4BBF4
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x0BABF4F63CE679CE418055BD3325417C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0xA21A82DB2D950AF667A28FDA4D2DD7EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0xB7E1BEF72F77265113387DEC2281A4EB
rough.  "I will try."
0x397F571EDF644D5D8E1A9BB65DD2D18E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x37DB900398CA195AC7D4583F2F0342AD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0x98D44AD430DACEEA051697686CBD6C33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0xF2293CEDF03CBA5F606E5A16E7EA119C
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x3552CB74F08FDA9FDD378FC0C573F822

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x28D8BC1232D2D339A1A2393DF80426D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x95D1A0B0577342432BC392BBF570170E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0x4E02E5A62AC60112D0FD0CDECC24E832
soon, no doubt."
0x8654BA40BDAFCC5BDC7B9012A474534E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0x491BB531F03EE6A41718756D79AE735A
say--
0x303A5F51222F3FD46D57FFF4FF02207D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0x862732AC7D664E6A3C576F339624066A
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x16FF812385B3CB928C6CE3EB7FA35414
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0xBC562DFF7678281D989AA8EB775D81E5
rather too hard."
0xDF1817220CC2A60C7C502D75B8E9F2C3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x1795A519F82B1BBF6C22D899213C04F5
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0xA2106945DDB8989AABD205E325651092
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0x8D1A37F2975ACA25A2D2E45D5B0B1B28
the main subject discussed.
0x0B411E2737FEA492EDBA651FB35C6CF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x4F847FBCBEF71D577D280D6852EEA73F
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0xB2EF72BEA22CD70B8B84D77929CD2FAB
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x794379EB53389979E6CA0F17CC95A1B1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x52AA9C1CDE08E2FFBB464C053FB1B4DC
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x92AD523540B8DF70760C6307B86FEDF1
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0xEF0725339C4625972D4233DC8B9CFBD9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xF0BE615B83A8D8B01ADAE0683DC4E5DF
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x5D0E172A25D1DAF6635AAF4C918955AD
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xD62FA228AA77F5A68C3A3D2E86489C47
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x9910BCCC6E2F27C82CF33F0023A27BF9
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0xE8A2653394E0A1C8E4CD02666A7703E0
bad propensities.
0xDAE939B43C0847947406559BAF081D94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x8154B98E36DE6250BD49B5ABBBA52A32
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x403D42F5D2BB663317FC7CEC62F3D0F8
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xF918DB13720CFE9C3B0B73343B469B70
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x73611CF56D83F7D0401CC5709856D76C
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x8479DB96385FE2E592699A2DDB7B6A4D
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0xC646B3CFED8B3CADB2FC8053FCA97C53
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x63C15850D8DCA540ACFC17127957A0E3
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0x7F9D68ED376F9214A5E1B6663D1F105F
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x943ADEA2C5B7B0B7C52B4089D115961D
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xAC2BEC675A8CDDB3F739C534FFEBC9AA
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0x55BA8D7B6FE3FA1A8B9BAA5E16EE5049
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x05732FBD499693B5EDB11A42F59D028E
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xB74E99212914312642F92E3ED8BF7155

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xF14BC878F842D45A888C8B00A33E2670
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x65B1F8F73C79D056F120723FFDF7D54C
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0xAE4F420EBF64C5D18D282C9EBFD9E410
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x2286148735184830E0C24FC57F192EFF
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x5D70756782ADC832D1D1704F7F165AD1
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0xAAA4C9B2639D9EDB107C482F9968F6FA
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x0CBBE3376E616644804DC90DEAE3984C
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0xD1308B5510F6865743DB9F0987887C95
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0x95363FF5D0020C3F839F1C9138E20D1A
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xBD72FB0C361961747E96059AECFFEFAF
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x7B3DABE9311F5E8B1EA48578E8D11CE0
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0x585E699BFC005F077AB4B10EDC0F89E7
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x179EBB28A3AD66DB2C0C890F9E4283AE
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x44E5A225DD97A8E1ED2612B214755EB5
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x665052A26D40CEB5662223849181E195
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x53CD435F0E72D78E730976C4A8C0A8E7
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x83E5E6F7EB6B4796EFC83F61F58D82CC
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0xE70303A53EBD926A2F7AD392A1911F3C
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0xE9194DF7ACA04CCE23F4AACDFD100981
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x9982DF68724CC35C36C60792B35CE707
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x8D7FF4F6F72B947B43E1E54C6CC1D705
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0x3F6E21E366FABAE40FC25903163D7519
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x7E08AD743423AC044D902A4B6EB3BC8A
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x2D3AE427B5BA0DD4347F938B82CDDD75
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x7E579B6870460A5A834E7901DC73EB81
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0xA24B11292B59F241ACC911B2922D9629
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xA7B333A8E04B14B34897DD5C2E64ACE2
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x60CD4F9176C75C14B5B37E89E378CC82
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xA21D4C8E800561B2176C2EF046112ED7
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x14890852B6F24F1B72874DF20AA2BA81
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xD2BD857BA94ABECDE06BC7ADE417DB69
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0xD7B203A5BD927CAE9AF11FAE5EC04AA1
untasted tart.
0xAB000B6EE1C4CCA7090E97FDAD7EB893

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x505690783CCF78D5E2295316F61BEBD2
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0x4F68FC039AE35E58258035E51D37FD27
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x1E69211ACE50527E4DF368A855DE94A4
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0xC3F9089827FB5FD382AD0598DC840E24

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0xC26706A3DE35DD17F8336EAFBC575ECB
      A long time ago."
0x7BC1EA231BBF8839AE800BB6E2D02A13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x2CB878E84189396028607F387F12C2D9
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x43C00F3836B0FA718248CC21E16185BD
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x8CD25EFA7CF58FF4791134DBEAC26D0C
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x79C883C2F2872CA21996FC5B5BF345F6
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xAB0B6CEDCEEC85B37C5B0453C6904D8F
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x0EE7A7AA5118E77A0ECE7019AE327A7E
one.
0x740767645B14528478256F16B1B9B34E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x1203C85419C2E314884D4D32518575EB
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0xDB2FA2C39819636121262E81BAF0072A
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x8791A3F3A458437A749812AEBC8D2B2F
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0x6875A5ED4461A478BD8BD7814918938F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xFC68491B9A66FC63DF2EE3FBF86C9C34
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0xEC245D83DCCEE132D07552182DD5C5C6
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0xF1C7CB53EAFC5A7FFD447BB8C4F6213C
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x7A48AF0120348DA4A7F2BA6CCD8ECF33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x13A3CBA49F5D3C5516C2F7AED493D293
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xC990AEACF92DFE03A260A6073CF88B12
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xA81D2619F81CE002AE5359CACEE181A2
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0xA8F9D25F239D754A58B89C26081854A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x9586361A8095BD14A9D43DA8AB64C2DD
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0xAE1B4C3CEF15AEF90CD2B61BD44D719A
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x9419715E06440E3C828BE29BE5D8D9F5
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x94202D2CE9CD5011E9ABC3AE91E6509F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x32C4634250C388EA7EBF0F35D571CF94
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x8E2A696F496F29EB778F4C3185448F1B
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0x3967D86947EB28AB90B7B250EA796895
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x42618621D0AA3C433DFB6543994910B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x174B0499065F7343491D22DE25AEBC81
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x12301A11CDC82021142F7208356CCB6F
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x3E36F9788B934F70EA25C2EB8C6EE035
Lloyd came again.
0x212F23FF383CE98FFCCF14343E6508B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0xD68BC3C5CE6177E15A04ADEAEE7DD06E
how is she?"
0x489C184746F7848075320A88A6A34709

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xEEA5B4D7D1060CE4E40583E571435B29

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x0DBD515EDBAF1F879EFF0A1481725294
is Jane, is it not?"
0xF372EA62C26AB70E962C0A930E46EDCB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0xC973C925E1FF37BD0C4840E1B55116D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0xA7B18BD5558EADFF628C4759BCCFD1B6
Have you any pain?"
0x3E136CF481166AD206E61AD0A52D8AB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir."
0x8EC3397A381A2FC175F808A2411E412B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0x234A17D49331A085851338AE78852719
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0x144056AA104F8290F9DB48DA3986D8AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x0F821656B89C0FFE6873AB38A6DF77DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0xF1C8E33A35646D9A571C6782746EDF5E
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x362CDBE78798819E168CC88A1143F585
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xD437282BFD092B30EE989D2B743887E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x95A4798FE66F8AB3EC4880135E4004DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x0427632930ABDBBC76CC3A2F82500595
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x639848070B468094C079248DF05AEF27
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x1E8A3C58E9527E10DCBB73E5A62D4F45
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0x34F42C2C33ED44D47C201A2608672AAA
leisure, he said--
0x79ABE523AF0153B0F02864A6CB427135

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x1AABD1B39FCCAB96BE1F9F94572CC865

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x9D0D0BFAC4E612098CA85FF80D9D5B64

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0xDA22A8452422443F635A80BB9A03FE43
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0x48236C5C4C99EE65CE5E858C9293BAB7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xE04F9CE4F158F3970BAAC12F56C8F063
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0xD6CE909B93696430C47DFDA9C594958D
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0xE6EA9F6B65C1454E9DADFDE156EA2AE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x6A403DC12A76AD34A15674A7A51C57F2
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x31BCEB2780B2DF0A47F472F090DD7D7F
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x03DF87858D272DA3FF94873D7CBDFEE2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x1F92FCBB0F37B16EF40DA67EBC1FED6A
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0xC554FA7F27C840C66D055E37D21EC88C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0xBAC5BF006F77D72FAD83F2D4C58CE8D0
Bessie was gone.
0x841E9E40AF0D8AD7908B72D8DE0B5A43

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0xD07E7925E11590D722932B422176788B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0x2754695A738A358574CC91EE24EF4C7B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0xB0B53D33D7D7E2821CE3BD1DE29271D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0xFC6007AB2ACA5B21176799E5200EA159
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0xEC8FE8D1C6C17B892BE2B16ECB0898E2
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x712C9DAD21A15824E532F0BE436625B5
that I think I shall never forget it."
0xA1D3E7481874F6D136A9FD191F0CEE42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in

daylight?"
0x82A05A3580C1D2CC95FD7A632955F96D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0xFA4243A4A8BD301AB433F2CDBB2BAEE3
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0xD17EFEF16FB1E0FF9270B2C292306FE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xD179315731874517E199F3539A3B613A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xE012CE5C7EAAB4A7A0FEA30A8AF5AB12
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0xE1588A58443743AEF6A37685BB294B3D
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xB2D775C2C97C31D3AB518A301AEBCC62
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x2872C1B9B88256E1E51B68A59879AB59
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x5A08579FE5F4227692613BC1C01982DA
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xADF379C81F6BC77D93C2F416A859DBA6
though, as far as it went, true response.
0xAD144C092BEBABF9E5FDE5634189FB72

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0x4EA8FF9CDCAC211AE0813EF7E68D4864

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0x7AB75CECAAD171C5455936F13479F7E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0xF510140B28A6D615C29E3F6FCFF18AC1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x4196AE9A1BC9C514396EFF3A763CE66A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xD40C93EE4506A904CE5B294E03B46512

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xDF27132FDA24659A46329AF86B9CEA01
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x602F43CA3F6869C44573AA45B5AFECDC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x633074FAE2775362E87E7015407EE425
than a servant."
0x65095AFB1F1DE4475451FB62FFA56565

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x7DE22484416F2C72F5ED3D3BD5EDDE97
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x5F98049969A30A78E5E402F18BEF5713

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think not, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"None belonging to your father?"
0x23627E4DA3A2249E6602E0DE902C5DB5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0x6CB532FB6CC568932F43E9E226625AEF
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x13AFB799E3C95107298D7B7323133AEA
them."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x92E6497E4156FCC1C9232EA5A409C50E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0xC0209675E804E1A16814C458A169F669
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xD41F8F0156EC78F943D0CE97F03D2E68
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x585F98748D6681BC7CC13313C9E4775F
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0xE8180A3DF51047BDF2D408C350FAC76A
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0xC68E9D5A57B2E42FBEF917B9965AC3E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x6B94AEDB774AFC444A003B6CC6004684

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x0BF0068F2F1800537B3434B762BDDDB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x75DBE46C05D94E7769F6AD681FE0BD9E
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0xE6625FDE864B90801EB45A20FF092B31
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0xA3E24601BB22528C32767D4E4DE0216D
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0xE9FFD533A24A04FCA3ECB70A7A1F1A24
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x8DD91A6665A7F6BF11D835766F66070C
the price of caste.
0x8AB44FD21F28E99E84C3D1102CF85649

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0xD4485579A9F238ECBC4FC71D27EB878A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0x48288CF3F2A2EE88FA0C5E4A315D3926
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0xAD31A37D026C00328E82B7B4EE9AE39C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x3385C6863AC0846A08CA16C7F1781A0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x2F82172F03091BA1976A9BE3604E380F
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0x815EADCA2E72FA446E593A786DBDFA3A
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x308406838ED5B579B6B92508B5014E7C
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0xB63C8B57095EE7A1348D6A5CD3EFE1EA
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x0513AD8553C6E2BE0356B32C4CF71B27
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0x5220A866595FA6B9E1DCB3284837C1B4
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0x92AA061649C3FF50D9151EDA3DCD7A0E
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x7528739EAD392AA6743767E358C38698
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0x09475A75A46BBE0ABA83C2B4474D92A4
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x4C7C7F825FFA372439D43286FB146EA3
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x362BEB98A3179202B3C1142552ED2064
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x85ABAB79EAB1344ED1FDDAC2F327505C
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x9A93D31D4A28DFFE182B4258699FA7E3
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x89FC216C5970A6398C8C4954AF9B4112

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x6A407820F05A82507BAD5F83BC3CA8E5
musings.
0x3944A2B111DB563C282DCE8FB1FDC7A6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xAB35C29F9394F739D26B8881E57517A2
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x8E71A76A05C6F7DDF91DFCA689EE178A
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0xC15AE0E9E25B06FDAFE76D745D428458

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0xBDBFEF08FD9E2E67473009ECBEFC047A
the gravel-walk.
0xDB53859FEF0963BAEC4AB0EA621359A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0x77F7DB0C8D058DEBFD35FBB956EDE1D2
to her before I go."
0x287F0661D1B5FC79882FFFDB386DFC5F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x5994269FA7E976F1B0E916F45AA0647D
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0x3D6820544B772CD3261B23F86347700F
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x47744F9D3FF541A40CA7FA21482805E3
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0x234794C3E666C1109CD9692A476B569C
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xF3453C191211C49FD6097C9F282D39D5
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0xFA802BABD929D49176D6F1426589B728
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x4B1E03597CC98BFCBB2DD56E38BB8262
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0xB0A3D4D06DA87E05DEE60454EF9FF7CC
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x724CBDC11F697339127F04D0D2AFEAFA
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x1DA517CA2038435B099714BC36110CDD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xCBD4DD89B4D8F9A6D8F802D4509B64F0
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0x0E03E73CB629D7BC0F830993972CC9CF
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0xD8037BE1429BADD1809B89F6CC368A93
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x3812291B3B3A788D1F84024ECC560FA0
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x63EA508D6D1A2E8E3CB96BCF18CF00F2
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0xDADC8FE5CA08BB171475D912DA2F4A32
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x5D5B7F495CCD4615C4A5ADAF69735174
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x8B71DE632714E4D90DA6046A65B4EACA
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xC8498B82B8C4015D182CB6AFE5114C7B
of each other.
0xDA29905A94BAFE1AC5C92B1C1B2B9E9E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x8867674E314CE2BB370795ACD58D31ED
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x8C24F7F6CABEFAC87D72A23F197DEDB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0xE0C22EDAAD7D16281CB09BE332293AE3
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x0DCE6867DE85C5683FD01600CB6569F4
little toad as that."
0x52A5FF80F737CD097C708C0D404DA27E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0xC96D9A0D33E8130A2BD5A310C858B4DD
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0xA7E99D8DEA1E8C0082F096177AF1F447

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xB10D963994BA123D80CA3373FF08643F
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x011F758426C87D1D223FA9DB1E708E0C
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x288B7000516740038702F134BD2DE5C3
rabbit for supper."

CHAPTER IV
0x074D6A6315AC0DD82064DBDEE7296081

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xA487846BE5CB33EDD2AA2DEC96DC7EB1
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0xAF36EF247227A8BE87FF88A5E5DEB8F1
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0x1B7630A01DBC06F24A449D6DAE293624
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0xB27C33B98526E00EFC2BAC2831AEEB0C
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0xC82BEBAEA270252881F9EFAC139CF038
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0x628ECC336CDD2C337B40B48A6B5F85CD
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x1D66B4B6C82A61F541C2AA172F1F7636
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x8A646BD29EE2CB0F2F7B8216F67DAD77
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0xBB32D3FF91C19E31E9DAFC98441D2704
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x3F45C94EC57C750F97444126A9DA6858
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x7B58779F398F8E18B585B49CD89DC089
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0xBAB49A710C8C3E04C8E0992C37D412AE
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0xCC47CF6B76F8FB7C1CF198FD99D9B1FC
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x64E3377505A0E9DC0CCF45027CD7C11D
and rooted aversion.
0x7206426F20B8860F23E3525C40E4CA6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xA6C48D5CCCAAA8DA80D6980D762C47AE
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0xE83DBC8C2A61D4A69444F3AD372F9471
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x482F1C7C7572A7B21327B61FB35A1500
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x0E5DC2CAB12B2BB21CF41153579856EF
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x5292E0E7F302D47E0C313D4FF5F58A02
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x00AE583B43E9E59E53CAA7700C715E92
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xCB57BB375EDE4D88D3B5E49CF750E465
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0xA2F6E131DD7137CD4424A47AAD23B4A1
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xC643A3F08E55C6E2BA277F2D8F18379B
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x76835FC9F382D8151A59B10D1F28981B
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xED1F0E0386FF0C0442328A890CDE73E0
was stopped rather harshly--
0xDC6D0A1EE810EC21288B887A7B671771

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x51058026CF36A9DCBB5DF70AF099971E
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x7BE2230A24EB02054F3D914097616A35
should associate with her."
0x0F31205ACB9A6E81B581C21E922E0C01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x2023A49201FC19738517DBCA377EB53D
deliberating on my words--
0x245B50C0815F0F587E31A629271D9C83

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x64CA58D50A508094D250117410C14AAA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x3380FF5B87D1B369248144A44596E6D5
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x3ECBB2593A4ACA547D2B09D3E46480D7
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x9D98E467DB84E222FBBA985CA76580C0
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x7CFBDDBCD879BCBAB32523BFA60B0F50
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0xAD43D79474DE4745CF85651B59FC80D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x47A0F20C9C7A51376DD482095946830F
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x179976231BC46195F296D85350771E27
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x5456836A587F4373510191D7B80F7675
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x94A30EB98C1C217DE511B77B7B5D5AD6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0xD27B3D35EBCDFCA7934BF48B07EB106B
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x584D0A94BB0D350E00D688A9AA7610B2
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xF4E06E9FB77A7DD2CDB8A35C4002B431
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x940D55DA82000A3C8E3208446B302B2A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x1F49C7744FF828389A903A51E624F1EC
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x6025EA148243E768ECBBADCFB0EE309F
wish me dead."
0x4C351CB2AD7A69F00AB1508A09642643

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x56314CA3C186DD4CDDAA93B77F8F4A2E
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0x6E9930FC5EF614E3100EAAA5602C7657
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x47AD6434B550FD69B3AAAB32C8994FEE
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x3E3B0C89B755329BC98A741865F5AF00
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0xF6F1D5FF8A111CCD4FFDB5A6822F3F42
in my breast.
0x9BAAE14E3837A3931135A66C56399BF6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0xE7BBBA2EF0822B3BB5A890245F391E1A
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x188F0823512D84456DE7C9A67D7C3BC3
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xA118246DEA17EF96C217E8F9479031F9
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x84059D4B62A79867C9E6917AC811A9FF
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xD75E2A4442ACDBD5A3DFE140E9FE48CB
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xE9254EB6093FA1573407C9AC06B1695E
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x1D42F855FE5A50E0A205867BE8E9D3B8
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x7010CF7A000C06F1F2BCF680673BFDE8
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x7E4AE55FBD6768B169A649CD3C0C7A2D
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xD8901BC1B686B78D457AAB493311D7F4
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x023866B897F171C9CF3C024EB5B1E951
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x8CBCD718D7C6D1D96436F65470BBC2DF
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x6D7A02C3A4B57C0747EF3D2C97DBF2E2
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x371AD1E65545A3FFB74C5251205A8BBD
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x89AA69677C96316AE4770FEB78924F3F
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xDB76789260D5A16B5C27F64A1AE7E022
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x61443BFC6CCF334373DAADD0AA9ABEFF
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0xA9521970E0F534854C64B218AB6478E5
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x22806D63E17942EAB30797E5EAFFD639
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x602C45445D0A2749F91C40C340390A5A
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xC63566E897391F840850170971AE9BA3
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x35EAEA9FD317F6AE8CA53C5DDE259EE4
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x4A97F77F3A7864F9566136A58DB4305F
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x931CBDFBA5918B877EF6BB57F5238D5D
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0xC922C5CF5937EBB72FB52C7AB5711C95
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0xF2C77DDFD715CD6E3944C1DA0C97A2B2
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0xD1D27B3101918763FD75A675EAD6E720
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xDE3C9D137DC9B73CBCB2DECB1ACAF2B2
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0xA46CBA512068CFBB03C95A779F0FF3B6
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x755D1ABF5897C702AA57665B2B47DDAB
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0x5C03D7829290581313EEC6F1DC79F72E
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x314E9DEFDB831443449CF0DA4B343BB7
to be happy likewise.
0x6B5BB80445BA051AE5D9580189EAEF50

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x9D421C27498AFCC4FB144B8979F02ACB
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x8F0E5C7E4D0631C406CFB3D6DD83B53E
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x1074A79309D7650905FA2532159D6A21
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x48453091516D6EB1849D4755268888F9
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x5DDF87311762E251874823F55EE6D6A9
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0xBF8B514F3120E6CA214687973D6604C2
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0x7CF203E0B88241069A56BDED94D1EE5A
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0xB949C2DDA723ED32118E57AEBF92FB60
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0xF6223C38CB149E3865AF1D71D9AA8A30
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xDAE82950C8BAD0AA6D676B5A8102635F
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0xB0FF92FA28C6BEE942946E27A22D7B7B
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0x02D86EE6623472663F10027C563C0E2D
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0xAC17D07F86DE002D7F1203DC2DED7BE7
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0x02672F5D65327A8F9ED61F2EBFD7E180
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0xF2A31C671BE269AA788D6F876FEE8DAC
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x2ABFD9005C8FC9A68ECF530A860E8CF4
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0xE4755D28AAE6E30DCB18430CF28F07E5
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x4E2D182A07A0E4624C8F765EC29E46AA
Gateshead Hall.
0xE0A593BE61FEBD76CDD6488653A7F1D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xABCAC0E6A4F81FFBB222645E22FC956C
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x93EFA8CC0D38A741C1E9646E0231C983
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0xC5499347A538542E4CA19FFD81FEC446
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x545E1B45BE202B8D0DC21550E41B7964
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x9FADEBB4B26CCF2E6DB63AA4D839529C
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0xD64AC76E5FBAB3D7E017DB4EBC044088
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x76FA69D4F00C962558479A99217766F1
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x2D6D6E873C84E65E431EE211800727B2
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0x52027F2309A6DFD1C6E48823921E34BB
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x9390AD79C09504421A639FBE6256061C
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x506B9506F39F574ED84A6D2846A59189
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x3D5B94D6DCBDB1D988CEAB87BA07205C
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xA626EA52E36C27BA90F8A745CFF50209
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0xB3D544FF36260B0E2EDE2777FF9F893B
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xBC80B353C55835D21076A06193C41F80
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x7D01E31EB121F9B261045B7E8C8A37AD
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0xFA990A2687C1950FC3FB6A45AC15C51A
accuracy.
0x913B5718FA14402F66482040E78924F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x06C5424DE46CF3D293CF02CABC95F92D
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x1CDA4E423B44F1B65A2773CA2D9EA879
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0xBD23A0F3217AC8A6FBED4377CF9F87B3
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x41716195855B0B1B238B1426CBF271FB
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0xED73A6BBA179E951815B48C1F5799333
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x1F3E83D1222CF2ED77845B1BBF6EFA80
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0xD0147E919E541F1199D42B5EF0DC0DFF
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0x7F04C3415D45C5F80233253371E3D873
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x18CD1946669299B59161C89422310520
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x93A74FB0BCA70FF1B1E4B4B1D050CDFF
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0xBDB2F6F1F731CF83A228BA1EB759E7C9
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x60E9B15CA4A67E66F56DAE683DBFBBE8
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x5A698DF38A382F003BB9CE532411DF86
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xF0A783B60263D26956F79D6F04D1D766
frost.
0x13430BED61E049D0E65D83ADEE445708

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x849FA7434C5D91E1629DE9F5590E8DFD
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x89CF844DC3B3EC17912C2DF9D8D205D6
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xA8FB831D118AF0E8841FD9BC896681BB
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0x8992BE53964AD50394FA111EF6EC7FE8
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x0020EF9870F008516E6B6E1592CF7889
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x0A1E44276DB24F488D257F49C8949629
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0x3939E026CB24D36C0E2213301501C5FA
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x124258D0520C97B1D1FC97E34877D163
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x95C08D7078C5332EB3577FD550985554
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xBFF5173ADA289B2D417C6269C72766FF
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0xFA2E76EC639DDC532D3FBC39F1C27321
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x0D680C63D12F3B9EDB27FD9DE20CB463
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xE7D65E2DDC6029294F37831BA0AD9AA8
nursery.
0xA95A41775D87071779DED3FD4B7C86DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x9D60D84E711F7E142FA3F8DA8E6D139C
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0xE3CE462AE2400AE554C9EDD6B6EBED90
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0xA96FFE86DF02DED7F84FF9C33C449998
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x981BC888250688215B2EEBC3994F6185
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x3C012010281F01949AC74475D4C7F773

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x493D187CF1714AEBB8633E1940D6C521

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0xBB9BD6CEE911B22A9713E24783EBD4C7
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0xAF4E4AD875EEE40D5570874C7C2FEE04
window for?"
0x3636FC704E76A4DB75E47E722FD5A5E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x44BEEBDC34054A7350569E375BC5F1EA
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xC7706C085BED72FB888A0868BCADCEFE
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0xBF5CDAE5992C0F573954FA8CAE5F56FE
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x0F6E6E9C272178B689DDCAAB36CE9ECD
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x47EF67B1CA73A548DF92D7312915C690
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xD1037C606FF9FC68D95334738BA6F5B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x22F2B49E2BD74DD3C098040D30CD2B3E
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0xD6D36DC009729ACC0B7B29834B089B62
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x5B0BF9899720B9B3C904B46221E8EC80
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0xC59DCB7518CFFAE93B30D0F8B76CDA19
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x6D4F95554281FF68FAC8905DA11CDB64
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x92944C756AE2A8A4D8D3664F9E0DD53D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xA5978C10CB549D1426CE684D391A062D
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0xDBB53CEC104742DB5BE53156AFD2D711
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x82E7BB4B5A7B7807B6A096D03D1F9500
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x5F67F13D6B1CFDC18953D65DBD47C401
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x7FD8431585B631BA9F56353087AF68A7
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x3DD32181AFC13FC29319B7874F29F78C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0x7D3E4C84772DEEA3FA5288B698E47581
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0xDCCA31382042BD9013A67C7FD5721958
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x5060224D9CFA426D10E8013BC73010B6
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x7D9DC25595AF7DF16F5CB35406EE091C
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x654CF61CF91D5834FFB4F55C59124FF4
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x9A304D6CB8EC69EA2CE774D29D9F04A3
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x4E0FF5F862DA1F085EABD3107AE9B561
by way of capital.
0x22F45A87B2FA9B882E63A37934AB2E9B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x9F6A398323449560A87CAEDF5327C0B9
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0xA6A38320A6490E374457499DBFBB121C
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0xC6064BB90B179D904CD17E754C5171FC
you."
0x9ED21FFA9B42DD84B704DF1AD8C5B314

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x44245E3C21FAAE35A4683314C999033E
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0xA35A057FE3614DB4DE4A61B9B7DB7762
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x12DD71FF39A1E003BB0E04DA3C23812D
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0xC4CF1FDD5E10F91CA80051B6BD5B7BB1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ten years."
0xCAEAE7AF1F7EFEF01A718BAB6CC9F9EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x93A8B88FAF9FFAF5BFDA50868AEC7B33
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x8268FAAA32CA1EBFBF5E00037B49F1CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x2C42A9D8236C7F94A91FCBBE654FF430

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0xD2A47A629847910CA2F28CCEE5EDBC32
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x24215C2402D44E32AB70AA1431101AA0
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xEE4670052B5E14CE5F5449FA4AD348EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x6181458B9ABB9F0244A3DD1F356AA543

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x8498342A794E631BAE4CC0489B090810
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x60166D5F710FE41D84361C14B09B007D
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x340FA7597D02C08A101BB728290F325F
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xEB830B01E31316FAE978844E81929E41

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x563CE228C53E569767C712D108C0B5D4
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0xCAE19163B726748FB7EDD6F14BB83DCE
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x281BB36D98B27B7357D9F059F1751D91

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0xC1BF97BBBDA51D5DF099394497CC7CF3
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x3FD9480FA6F9B7CFCEAB5F912E4B7D9D
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x74E67CC19E3264FB212D34E86E9D1414

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x2714165CE7F5B6D96824A5FDC6629020
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x7D5D47991A9B40B683961D233E7CF114

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x956B8EDBC32F91918BD0214D5F3E7A19

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0xAF59B9CBD0EDA1C9C10D51FB37B3E3B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A pit full of fire."
0xD64AA7364C7E75BCCEA2F5DBC475CC84

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x861294EA69FAC907CA239D40A554A4FD
ever?"
0xBE923D3B6E050F92A1F10BB203152933

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir."
0x8EC3397A381A2FC175F808A2411E412B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x2FE8CD7443962024C13571D9757154D4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x4F9E765CA5FC11CBE39C92554AE372D0
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xCECB5A4021AEC1AF3BCBFEA4ED47201A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0x2AA08E276DB59C568D82131BD2E2DAD0
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x606921925435D2C1EF08DD048A0C34DE
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x1FD1134D10DF2CB02762B5FEBF1C53D0
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x27B7CFF6BB2B387F60ECC87FFFE95F31

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x023F2C356B19D4A8372CB0D201AEDBE3
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0x39AE50EA533F580D7A04646126637AFC
enough away.
0x1114D7B1D6F6CD543FE14CCD1B90BA25

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0xAA059B6CB2428CBF937AB1DD71C5C1D8
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x6D8A193290F35C49CD4C5ECF6C00EAF4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0xC7854141FD2B4AB48D07343930DC9C02
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x7E69227A8FA55749C759D3AE48DB849A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x627975685FF8D6DF94EE33949AB241CC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x75FD79CF10E94EBDD664BDB5BEFB23F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sometimes."
0x4CF4E6A9B209ECD87EAE429A43012A0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x743BF19D4B8C1FFFC15E4DAC7E57E7F6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xB715C6C61C721ADAA0DFE599423F0898
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0x5C50596228CEB985CED38E45FC1A322C
and Jonah."
0x496A605F4642217478282454F4636ED5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0xD374D309E14F63B2198D99E648A2C463

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir."
0x8EC3397A381A2FC175F808A2411E412B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x25FD84FBB4398761B5FA14E937B1CACF
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0x2E77AE23ABF7BF8D6280B4F4E778D587
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x84100A51F0AD1DC442FF05BB5F1E4EB5
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0xB1FBAD066CDD56EA11CCCF8A1952DBDD
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x28FF79B2FEFA12D2DA8E56731200B572
piety."
0xC7AC8D345D6008B34A0B2D1D24B8182D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x5C72254690DD3A08DF243D752090252D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0xAEF0CA264056E6EECBE180596DD64E40
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0xE8490B6A1E16D703641D019A899A3D85
give you a heart of flesh."
0x0ECCF476076F336B82C1C35DF788DE36

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0xC38330EE749CBE42CF4AB74A09AF4EBA
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x0248F1C34580F43C4A9EF2BEDAD2351F
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xB9F2D24F8A11191A7D1ED0BED4B8DE3D
conversation herself.
0xA1B26FD8922B2A3D8A4F7EE41BB6D52A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x249421FC272548AD74A09E0C90452A17
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x59B50CE98F5077FDC3199A28B3CC159D
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x449CA3A1EDE68EB67D69995312BD6F20
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xC8D61377A90D88E4C19FDF3673D3D125
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x0B0A370177D951359EBF9C7BC520C747
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xB4AA30616F20FEA61159FC0DB4271CE4
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xF72C3E66E20FD8CF735E8796C2C36CC9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0xBF3D898D1271CD96B4227AC0B3074E5C
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0xB995DD353D093E83D9C109D0704DBCCE
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xB02536070D184315164617D424BB3AB1
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xD7A6BCA71D258A81946EDE65D1518D67
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xE785FE57EB7820D89D73C764D4E55BD8
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0xDE7E982BF57717FF20CE5819C3078BAD
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x4257747440829C7F4B9B0AEFE31BF188
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x08D4D3E3C849E307F4D37D77A6326228
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0x5D87CF5078A338FF5FE63F9C937EFBF5
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0x90AD654681F803050A309F9D53FC86CB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x97D264231848B1E9029BFFC92D67F674
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x1F802A7069CB31FDDBF9A649F15E1BF4

"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0x9A8282A4A9E4F7654A68831A6AFB5DDB
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xD4E6DD219BB76846274DDC40C3086A6D
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x6D432D9D9EFA58933882932F11932A04
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x914B7DAACEBF62FCEC75B70679F8EE01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xA33AADC26934612502ADC2AAAAB15124
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x2E40E3720D124333F935ED3EA5826031
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0xF96187792D4F2C3BFE4A97684636DE4F
Lowood."
0xD93BDA4C2B481F8B49C050BB4C4B9AF6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0xCFF21DC922DEF84DED2FA0171EC7F54F
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x892F3FCB03D0DC806E5C042686AF7EA6
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0xE0B62712B7C58E794C7017604B61A57A
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x4985F72D915DB717954B913D2FC75AA0
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0x20148BBE9447D0A49A5A0A38F25774CC
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xC6BA5718F51A1C5DDBB35821BC1F3934
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0xA143F970EF63BCE8509A05025C497ED9
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0xB733EC26E5157F4B00B7C6EBD2395070
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x7B2918B10ABEFDCD04F15B429351B079
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x58D484072C446390A77230450FEE9D8A
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0xDD18DE767A1E7957F17B757173D8BD92
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0xBED4A2F97B3F0CE7D1C74CEF32AB1C5D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0xE65DC3A424E1C15C95501280F4DC0FCF
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0x690FB20FDF10B4181AEB9CC9BB444BD5
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x7E76073ACB77E2063009F78288EDE06F
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x1893BD39E76742E7CCDBE79681975413

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0xBC02265E135555E9040BB92F2EA415E9
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0x8CC12B576ACFD1811976B938033FFF8F
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0xAFA693200DBABD9D85A36F3D055B10C9
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0x03E0B925EEACD86A3544FD0C0B34AEE7
inhabitants."
0x92109818ECC8F579D223BBFB6FB2075C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x80BFE347DBAB4A021049B5A29A4AE359
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x285A4382B890A668B8779E566AAAC31A
and prospects?"
0x609D61966C5B27B7A7EC4BB503A817D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0xE0331983B2E2874BF75C4863131FC6E5
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x74668B8BD42648AB6161E65683745F77
of her election."
0x590FA97A2CE7D5C7B0F3ADC7D3BD9356

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x046A86F59D6BFD7CF539CB815538C22E
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x7139896A4332D0ADE1542CC8AC0D132F
becoming too irksome."
0x5D1B4D90A814F138F30943AF6F504F67

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0xD55947A1B03E44138781C1785888B444
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x1D3D270534EAEFDF38E77BDF7E489284
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x0C05CED4D463BD965AF3C19914547872
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x6BA7C01DA29CC300BEEFF565451EAA4C
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x394CC9085E88641DC1155A23F3EF85E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x19DA1F59481A40ADB0C62224B106C7B5
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x4E208A66DAF8D3BD6BE444D68456522D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0xA28C24DCE1E89B695E6E215DAA01BB5D
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x29673567E095C90C7E348785A2A17A60
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0xCABDFAFA4752F9E85D5470D170D84AC5
falsehood and deceit.'"
0xAD889FB5BC7F192FF9A44711CA14DB14

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0xE36AC754AB4B4EA2A1CDF58CC16D2A2A
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xBDF7343129E216ADDD7715C6C213CBD0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x6689BDF558459523E201C277ED3A16D8
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x0D773C200C1EDF654DE9D85F954DCA5A
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x2E125DDE13748385CB7656204EF68E51
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xFB42B62B15ACD51BDA8ACF36A05F36DB
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0xF3E5F4AB8E684A6A75D58B6F155D0DD8
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x3342E03CAA288DBCC247918880A66779
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0xCDE0C5D667B75E7F30F63B2236A96325
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x6694876E7BDD33961552456936A98EAF
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xFAB0E4A56741A6CC815A4243A85D6151
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0xE6BE0A5BE2D233924CDB40245A268AD0
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x9471CF6FABB1346A266B065DFEC6AA45
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x93F19978D9780D6F1675C49B5D50B9FC
handsome attire.
0x5EB174022920C32BC70C5373C843DE25

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0x96256DE85D5CE97E15099A26658D823A
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0xB1DB26D70CD9A53197ACEF88A61A95EF
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0xE351444648FEFE6976DEC85B7891BA56
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x904822B39E9A2E426ECBB14225A0ACE0
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x5DB48FE1F1239AA69145F8D0E5304031
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x43BA0E8C851ADBED50D837E2092B9F1F
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x368FBC8C4B20C2C8E8C51A531C40CA46
fomented now within me.
0x45A596916EB22A09999FD0211A5E4603

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x68535785CD4359E972B7148AB96E43D5
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0xFE7AA0F9E7FD1E2D617B6638DB57A730

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x24243BB699684F7C448EC276BF49BC78
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x265AD15056FEB8B1B2134F9643C88CD9
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0xACA4E26B4FD3A78547983BEFC1EA9CA7
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0x54E419B3CF2D1DEFE1C8A16790507CBF
to her.
0x1D4B5D22B8FA3620BD6C94928AAFCD15

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x700B92EBA31E824087366E3A45A077BB
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x57A8C3A1CCD691CEB0CDDC36110A6F9C
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x832B9A47D3243EABBC01B896A2E89CA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x809DB458C17B3D3F8C3107569D25BEC0
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x017401DF721053BFD01266A7C729FACB
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x21AC39CA73CF3272EFA98D224A32B275
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x7F29A0AB74361F9CE7E72CB2C34753B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x091E5AB5940524EB3FDCCCD6F88ED86E
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0xA18A0524572814CF6B42AAAFA1622FDE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0x95A371FABAA45ACB3BB82DE9128911B5
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x3D2E103D3A1439CBE224BE203E56BE0C
used to a child.
0x253DA22E9F793D03D50C7D9B28C2B007

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x09E521A8834EDD2796077A94EF899258
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x82434272916D8F4A9352A5C3404704CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x15907ACAC38681F240FD7EA85756E80C
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x944633DC6130AC588EE1C31962231526
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x1348FAFB766097DF8FD2CFF5BA8DA54C
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x09D1411025375B89276BCE0E5402880E
miserable cruelty."
0x24E5E8134BA8465907E406EAED9E7192

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0xAC70F7DD6A2A4BA17761DE15E17EDAB8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x956F48A48F2E70459290C7D38BFF76BA
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x2B490716DCCBBA34F723A420068EB556
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x0955794C07449DCE8CC37F482733BF50
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0x4747CF646504F3BFB2C4082FEB9E4A7B
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0xB0F09A1B379933D65C9903EBDA4FB9B2
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x200BD12A2AB1AFE1ECE22584C72006A4
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x7F602073346FB51B739DB975DDB194B5
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xD3AB5C3D4A93491CE0D5B7C64C2CD526
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x46D57F21772BB44BCE45307EF470B3A0
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0xCF2DF2EB5CACC4FB345F988F148F498E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0x18A58715EE98C242B8FCDFCCA7BDAD3F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xF5F831B7D3AB768F74E2B067DD63093C
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x9D76F756C660283B05C8F5CE3D466DFF
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0xC40E8A34ACAD68A962CC4ADE40AA0372
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x66F030EF40B821EA753F55A3189CFEB2
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x1266B681ECE9250D79CDBCCC5C94E756
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x38403B14124B67A154EBD2AF7597F817
would cry.
0x98D012900041A05EE1E04F06CF8F644C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x48F9ADEF201C2C02CD3838453387F32D
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x12F8916AAA59B3FD93F2E3D99CAD7618

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x33495060B82BF73706151A468929B6DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x4075A840B961B18C66335C554F6AA8DE
your friend."
0x0C6605C368164B9444F7633A29E6F986

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xCD41F8E0AA27CC3DB52220CC626F5C6B
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xE8BC04D8DC304082B5C39E201EFEE431
you have done."
0x69B34E41821170633D4422B748AD0921

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0xEAEAA6334099E25410259A7BAB3E345B
their faults."
0x4B700FAF8BDE5CF6BD54B1B87F76E569

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0xC5A710A8866452154A43BB12BFED91C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0xF0E8EAAE0E117EE29AC62BAA12DBA59B
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xF92BA979D436DDFA11462B4C936A99DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x9739BABBDE7E804601962991D9F13177
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0x395F25AEC3BEB31A08BAFB22FEDC3864

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0xCAFB2A3B3B919BFDCD70E9D50382BDEE
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x37CFA393550093A34D0FE7BFF9DFA0E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x87A8D44010A4C0929B356F3646DD9811
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x6D71BC0D507DF6546552F02C2A1A8063
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x5B557D03996E36FB284EE98A565F451F
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0xDEFD4C99143ACB0DA4347175377F1239
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0xE376D6CD1314AC853012C7682A24FDE7
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0x56E091D0B6BBF37EB9BBB38B91818655
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x023B29AE0DE3DF57EA588C2F38B9DE2A
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x6CC8773A7AA37FBCF6261883C2B8CA01
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xDA04F2500A51A87201EA96C8F507B5DC
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0xE5D0E69F22F873E9C8D5C24572CAE10D
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0xC5B7A9500485C5267D3EE27C453C5CC8
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x027C26EA479ACFD1D47F9394713BDB6B
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x29B417BFDD2AD2C22D7E7585FB8697B5
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x7ADE119A6CAD77CA4FE63FA6FCCFAC42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0xCDA1FDB2D814E730F4B009E2E6CBC000
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0x7AD6E51B3AC2E624A8496BB6EEE4A6BA
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0xE069403E729807E54121BE37A95AA5A0
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xAD1B60C639C4AEA433FA591F5C94A0FF
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x90D66E6F4B242AE9C5B49E1B8355F54E
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x1F1E1506D069EF4F27DE2104F771E2DE
of my nature.
0x4A0DFDA3C3CBE09BD1A8EDE0F64E2ADA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x72AB99EDA64C14E8A2A6A65B433713E0
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x8B5AAAB938473F2240EF9F6D4B9B690A
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0xAA16B5D0CFCEBA54DF1B13683E6EEA0D
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x98A8B45F1ED271B12DE85652644A7519
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0xCEC5847A30D1D15E35C4E56FCF987017
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0x116FD2B477729547C624E6590096C79B
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x358ECBB0354B630FBDCF4055668D880A
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xEBC4CF20D32FEA845E2F1BA47FFA727D
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x04A135F38676D2E400BFEB9FC46F0362
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x66BDA272B5FD8BCE59986073E6BB67DF
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x566C5B120643CB9C0CBAE5AB6712AAB2
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0x66815E63C6F1C4CB42A78A53E51272CF
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x7A283190B00A14C8A8C0423E025A2ECB
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0xBE4116EE18C01449736E1562ED5FA34A
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x1D89A3A6FFF312CC326269EF76F31F5B
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x90FCDF3145A3E539EF0A9980FDB1559F
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x7E08BABD02CADD722C93AB6F30ECAF84
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x745E35986B9958D7C642F8942469E6B1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xD68A12A5D999219A3989BCC0452E21FB
to lunch!"
0xF525D8FF918D6E5A826DE5FFE93C4518

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0x74E493BBE3FDEC8BAA4ED9A08EB203DA
came tripping down the path.
0x617AB3ABC111E4FE11C363766AF45F2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x99C0C4249DBE21976F4B0185F13B3FDD
called?"
0xE8A47CEF1E5196CB59CB8C0B00DA951C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x52E5D33DA04E356A12CCF070E4E7F27D
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0xBA9CD7F4A0221BAE30731C38E5DF14DB
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xCF22F0610F879D2E85CE32A64B2E63EF
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0xEA83ADB3347E9F83A399D04A3BAF8A6B
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x5978AF2A459F4FE7C7F1033EDA9A0F3C
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x0C0F6584D073EFBFC30A03B82982F8B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x53C3D2063CBD7FC9135247F3743955A2
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0x1616ADE8FBBE93ADD1198F4D3CBE627C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xA25FDE7DB7FDDD78D618F7FEE8AB412C
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x25D31F0792E2AE223E4992F551592CCF
suppose?"
0x957F443FB2DE35206FBE71375CFA0438

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I nodded.
0x9FFA2D987A22EFA2576931CE416318DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x9037A282BE90AF66AC949F1AAED26D51

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0xD471859BADDB9CA936785449B88B77D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0x23C27BC287359E0DDCAD6AE8FF1CA42F
be bolder."
0xED3C6B0826B933A8D83FFEF63B87F8A5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x1B376E2A83C881A95A6E369197927EE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x62590FC93FA8B887CB8E36AC03B9CFF8
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x82A957028A5852C79402E9D5E77BEB33
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x0AA3635054EBCFDA3EDD74AA50C7174B
for you."
0x7A518808DC51169CAC89B8022A16B1D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xC2342EBB93AC93CECE7F57F4E3BA27DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x7C96D8BECBE06467DD4E26DAF36A6D21
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0xE33AAF6929948FE9AF5A8E4BB47602E1
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0x882EAD8625C398EAE3733470D52B13ED
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0x5B3CF329E4A3D681B96E881F13E3B70F
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x58CF236434A5F4EAB69B263205718E16
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x18B57E7AB8D0541B80F56892A3C38C1C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x99B12B5012AB56278AE25C0F2435482B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0xAF1D2ED0641C3E2F15FA5B915D1DF774
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x8EB38413DA0DE57F6024764A9A087DF1
provoking."
0x7D259F2E8A471FA33A1BE2C85019D9D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x59021F5835526BFD0B69C240BEB6C3F3
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x8B4824D4B77A4B69E6EDDBEA2ABFF980
dread."
0xA281292191AD2778F4E4EEE78BD32CCB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x324DE93AE64F643D4AEC568922C02F86

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x6E496840C491B38AE67AE3CB8623A91C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xCE777F26F453B71F74EB52BDAB704D92
others."
0x7ED3D97B2A36401866C796767BBF3F85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You don't show it."
0xF7A73FDF196C446D39763238B9708194

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xC6243B0412E70A1048D2815BF036549A
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0xF33F9D6B59F62CC18F765CE3F2013E4C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0xD2417FCDDBF7B429F8EB7E2C880FB766
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x3D410A18A2B646F1CCA5FA7270AE2FD8
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x55A347F0DADF6809A53765A9897CE21C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0xB069684D95E84B8E128C1B560D96DEE9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x040109A1AEB2B38BBF8407C347975991

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x75A2F6D72E7D659381B7BB3D11E2F575
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0xB087FD5E6F561822E32F9C41CE762E7F
you'd _rather_ not."
0xAC78744ADDFC2699B06F0C5FC2B84843

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x88ACEEDCDB90C21BBB3C52A61107AEC2
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x633FDEE3497FD2E2379E5FFAA4A8EFDF
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0x8FB61837F52895D5BE5A1070E039EA34
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x747977DC69CB538315C3D2244157C753
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0x43E40BA027DA8CFAF688FE3369C2E18D

CHAPTER V
0x014F19A378309F1622E7981FDD98E3FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x540F3440F8E5BE0FC0FA9DA98AC844B2
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x927E6F9F81D47152D39E2197583B78C6
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0xDD0897A47893D49C5BCE8CF88B60DD00
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xBBA1E1CB8A583580DD9454BE2CDDE169
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0x4D6054CFB5C4B34B2F52FB8CE7C183AF
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0xFC54E8CF7B7B363265C3199E4F73424A
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x1D54275F9DDFEBBBEA168633C6242F3E
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x523B96BAE2302178E56D34CC9C2125AF
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0x4B14E424493B83F003D9C037638C7E13
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x67594ABEE521546D476930282A2F9A23
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0x6E7C31B4E16EB4A2D9AFBB64B558A4FE
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0xDC406227FFD72E49019C5AB799FC0F0F
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xD3B0A9228E483FBDB0EE2D9CFA8A8352
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0xF794110274CC5EBDBAC44CB5AA0A038F
bye?"
0xA3EF1552F7D90E5CB2F23F2DCCAA533C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0x48100CC4404149F75AAFA5F6F0AE5829
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0xA8B76BA753C7BE879922DCF4EC450290
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x4B6510FA3AB70A3E9BDEB6B60996C89D
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0xCAEACC7EB2C876A80D5FFC18B5FD67A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x36C5CB93C09522C2E4E5CF7E85784A37

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x7A05A8784F356D5037F6CD7150116923
the wall."
0x8461E3DF7FFCBCB838630237E96B56D1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x14C40B47405C5A3A1601227BFCB258DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x3A8629EC27D74F0B90306D6FB6496C62
been my foe."
0x1CAFA732E9C17DC9AA8C171D8C9B0E1F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xC4400A43890E5F4EF983A0FA30B2E22F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0x957B7418614095AEB0439010498D2267
out at the front door.
0xA3C9FBEBC690392EC06BA0AD0B9E049F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x1D2D81F83C3A438662AC47B4E16BA584
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0xEC7FD1B2FBC104785D02D727481B0EF6
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xAD3721C3F5C7F86BC61C05DC295B2C89
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0xFCF4402A66EE6B986FBD232B5EF5D268
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x1FBCCAA699B9C415BEA3BF7EC4FED781
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x76E80778E8E6A861E7C740CA6F8C46C1
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0x9E2F40DDE58B47A49753AD1C57BCD40D
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0x8BE0AF6CB89241367B27E98196F43BFA
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x350955DE89EDB139267A139610101188

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x4BB4DAFA87375FDCEE9596D1E5A595B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And how far is it?"
0x1CE9DA577655DB65215A3D96A36EE55C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fifty miles."
0xA403E1D42CABFB132BECADF22EEB870D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x795C5D84046BBCC530F8F3A822CEB2BB
alone."
0x52C3C4644F1FF51061AC56D3AA175968

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xD31EC243740B3AEFE47D5A6DD24E4029
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0xA51A7E0B2F83E5902CA3A41085F03D50
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x0297C820BBCCDE54FA2FDEA654A6B9D2
with kisses.
0xCDA95E358295B731D3D4D8DEF1904542

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0xB43151132E560AA33A92DA486D470982
me into the inside.
0xA14FFED964B2B55DC868A14E878B54D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0x98D002FC296FBB76992C8E03215E9CEF
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xD7E3B097590948D416A92722ABA971DE
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x4C82DB47FCDFB61F53E7BCCA26D2FAF6
mysterious regions.
0xE33E0EB658D6211DD1CC522DEEAD5BF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0xBE62B709A9B74A12C73CE9AC795B145A
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x440002EC7441B2535425BA9F1C810842
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0xE65DEBF413C180951FFC85C7B6C36641
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0x5D1F21AA110919A8C16BC2A50A28B588
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x827A7CA7B7E4E8C37722779C08CA1DB2
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x76477B5EA6D99BF2DAD355683B430A3B
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0x046EB8712C84E55FAB5B9271B3ADD107
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x89BC1396D373F86943B76E0F9C3EBCC8
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0xAB5AC9B955AC9E403054CFAFA23743A2
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x7FF337B0A9D935C718269979A90C0EBD
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x5ED660B6FC3603B645C9E7C2BBC187E4
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xDD8760863D7617BC47575CB8D8DEABF5
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xBD177B316C6E3087EC59828C8AD03B33
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xDE813D9B6D48847AEC8726A90708A3C2
"stony street" of L-.
0xB6A962B998952EB31EA31256ABC88EAB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x5D7730DA516F1126D4A2506CCA61D33A
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x9E0E6E770A445C9DEC5E206680223D96
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x1954E9344EBB944779AD38AF18672FEB
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x344226FAB79D7BB1F0F8E20CD7A1586B
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x60AC83AD9A700B3AE5A55B1445EE1A38
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x0162F76A3BF04CE9C6336E37EE1B771B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x72A66A9DBB558502823289BDA2C96E11
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x7EE148FBDD296948921DDB7EF6269BF5
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x56AB86CE8A516FA42685262567A63D8E
by the light of the lamps.
0x5679B5C551C6DBD5FF0824B0EEB4A8BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x33AC78F0F7C225A0F5ED7B3C57F2F89B
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0xA5EFB2E45D9AAD77181BFBF68028412D
instantly drove away.
0x89FC278E4F61D4BEF03513B9C5324BFC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x0561CE53D9B9F554E6C218B19BE24BC6
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0xFE0F53451B72D613642C4A16481BA503
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x92C354C0D4CDD481CCA6A2070E9BBD27
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x67736CEEE4D741148F72EDA7A3ADD835
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x6AF40F1890464868D2B6CA691392D8AB
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0xFFC1DA44ECA318434CAA6E2A43B7C364
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0x21995D96FF3DA8A322536C45F76DA4B3
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x88305FAD2EF3BFA44797754151C31EC0
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0xE2C571F04A648ACF8D759F8B346EB753

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x731530C31D81A78F3D2BF1ECF4EAEABD
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0x6F97D5C366D2C40696629BD0DC1F2BD0
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0xD5A47C61BB36C1B10877DA2111A902F8
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x5BB6598199E944D0FA7EB3F50711DEB4
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x047443A4A84F0F3369901F31624C3912
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x395AADD86C506F73303F0323402AF313
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x7FFCA3F4C7F9C1CF408E76A5354E808B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xAB474DBDC2F62CDD40DE3AE7AD6FEFDF
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x54840F032DB7479DEF738A4D11899E52
grave, her bearing erect.
0x1DB928FF7DF9C33A2BB25C0130E3E6E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0xA25C27CFCED6A47ADB6393DE45F228C2
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x6D22CEB9FDDCB9520AAE4D3B9CE306E9
then further added--
0xA65D0DF25A3CE3585DEC7436C1A600BC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xC3699CF34D68694E4B17266F411DDA78
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x364977F8E9BE02E320242F04C07B3FF5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A little, ma'am."
0xA0AA3829193D4248744058E5C876BE4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x7FDA42CE8C6654FFDEA89DAF71B2FE58
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x979103EED80F878F5A62C953717E5AD2
come to school, my little girl?"
0x71D81F8C6341B74F41A37F96CF47FB1F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0xD60433BC46F5C9449A61C0A27C74E2EC
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x6E550E3EA6533D0934AB4700FFD18EE2
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x483CDF76EADD2CB27B470DB5EE300A8D
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x722457A9B8D42383E855C56CCA68BEE7
me along with Miss Miller.
0xFB7BDFD6CD4FC3C1CC12E7682142CB5E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x154F6751712C0CB2F27734F41BB70A1A
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x61CFAB4A51BE61E17517BCA4CCF3CF3F
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x739F94EA3BD7937A0DB0688941376444
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0xE96BC484FA482475FF968AB2DD79BD4A
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x4B1A27864649CD92D75DCFEC2C1E121C
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xC9D97512135B52FF3E7258F24E84D4B9
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x62402BE34EFFBF0956E07533B8F2DC8D
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x4CFF14038AE430D5D92AEFF8EB55250F
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xE982D56A0D744F479621838A141DE369
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x05FED174B3E396207211DE02F1475E3E
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0xD1946DC1032FC8389598B2423ABC5043
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x4298E0673741DCE28AC21940E18FE810
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0xD85ACDC342D182E4F5F57A698B768B8C
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x4824770B44B286B6A670C5989D29FC4E
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x109444A4F94C57F4CDED69C69F0DC9C1
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x9D6CFC76DBFBA285245DD6CB5A903EC5
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0xAF4675870D63C59CB5C60DE8A6DFEF11
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x0BBD6B2999311B28ADA317DE0076B638

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x20D9F0523FB689510C2BEAFE0B91CE89
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x9A326FCA013EE6B1DB5799218D8FBFFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xBE99CB32421709C371A88E575E339BAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0x928B3B43F57A18053AF7FF10AF6CD9BF
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x5300DEDD2C5CE1BADCFA71F20F5AEE82

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xCD6C88D5803015767D774BB1470FE171

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x47A580AE1E6F1324457C66A6C294B5DB
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0xBBEE0F40AACF6D68CF9009E4D2E655DF
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0x2655B692A4B2454641C44C7C4FF6988F
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x01F915B7429203491E24BC72811AE858
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x6AD31E04311E0368B8CE131F4744ABA2
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x24A0E0A2AB43B9CD262BEE65D89D5CCC
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x5031586AA99D6B560DD56F08B6BDFBE5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0xB14E87C3D6CD910F326AF14B6BD163F1
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x89BD1822CE936366E28542F61D04EFA8
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xB0689455C1D6BD1AC56D97435025752A
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0xAF76E1C8B9533EA50EB3C9C4BE6CA166
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0x6AF9C278AF9B5DCEC192D5516A057C06
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x7195324EB2994A15752620AED5173DD3
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0xAA0D6E3DD24B79904C1B647BCF473E39
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0xF9364C8DD670347C8D64BFBB0F3BA939

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0xCDF594EDF13A059255C69A3CDDD960F6
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x10B75C006187AFA4B15E7BDDD0105222
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0xDCF480CFC20099AAAB3C49771D5297CB
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0xDA25DF606017DAD39141F890E6DC3B2B
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x213A715F0808D964B9BBED6D8E0C262B
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x5EC1E9F130873BA7692EF86E709B00A5
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x344AA7A6A812D93DCB1677ADB46CC72F
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0xF2AAAD9B6245F51A90A51B06DCC0144A
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0xF5616E3569D2904D03CA86E001E94A28
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0xA5A340F9B6CF8037101856A8945FED55
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0xDC227BCB19F2D3090AF31FD220643BC8
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x6B8DFE00E7B1A650BA7AEF41D0B926AA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Form classes!"
0x61F2861FD153505D73A7A17C9DFAD8A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0xDBB170727080317C598DFF9ADC01516B
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0xC625DDE20FBA6F1BCF67F693B3959D77
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x4627F0272D3D144450C6E66F548485D1
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xCFB8FB1C815ADBAAAA635C53DF1C3B8B
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x6B551B90EB13185AC79E88C1913A53C3
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xC019D47C975E0804594176E207516F6F
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x64C14AABE5BAD6430CCDD7B28F3D2563

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x264894DEB3C8D01CCF78D553A640157F
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0xC097625A50A58EC475CB168B80DD713A
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x4DBBB9435DC8B80229A37F04515E504C
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0x762772A57E35C2EF2220903D5C60094D
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0xBACFC0B9580EE96EE94862EEDEAC60DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x629D094045E4370F6DE5FFB275CDD05D
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xCA28D0F0EA9A24C1BC618E1B5668DADD
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x7414780525A37D6B665A32365BEC7BA8
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x75FD9A552AC9702F29847128CBB14A60
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0xE16D2562E8CA43E669D4C5ECC74BD49A
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xD5BE29D1086D85D13744A14CE3EF1BC7
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x793F426B152C26ABF7FE33363163CC48
little the day before.
0x40D793BEF92CCE67903C56F9F74D5609

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0xE859BD002B470119B0B51E4A30F4B465
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xA3595DAAB2CD55FDCF1CDA38ABA0CC2B
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0x7E45D5EE5AFC887F343E39EB5695B630
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x2B627402EAD85661D4D20889D1C999D4
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x23EE11EB184C00CF513CEBAC0E853A53
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x0738C60EEB30A9FAE60343466B1D77E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x5750E86DD381C826EFBACEAA51B00F8B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x0985BCF33F86F2BD8380CE263B67997C
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x2BB9023BDFDAF3AE25682CA049DFE23C
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0x3094B7CF080384EDE665635D7D3485E2
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x007CF4997F6522BF51C546FBB949D92F
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0xC09A9EB062F4A5968E95E241C61D5515
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x6C968822E7089DC59B81BA5BAD2FCF8E
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x02A1C5C696AF851996B8BE910622D8C2
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x9AF30EF153C06030F40D8109F8137117
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0xC20CA69E16FC64B167633E3367829A9F
the meal began.
0x51EBFB6164BD69C07219A22D314E89C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0x5ACF212DF1E92E4A0A28EEE45640AC0E
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x41D748728337A972BA9BB5A3B364F8CC
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x62BC952A689E944563E6B3B794FE9265
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xDF8D656F47F0867F11E20B695D3A999E
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xC502A383BF6FC44C6A72A6505E6C8285
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0xF7C0ADF47B23F7B025607DD0DF4AE319
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0xC44F5ED9BA5525AFA2B62AC70FBA08B0
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xED274C02207EEF236C558B9F7FF0311D
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x529E97FD5D25082E71FBDD4B8BED844E
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x7916BB8344459415FD5434870059DDE6
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x735D9E9876F82D4282BF57E969355289
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x045F6A6FE3C24BDA93BA766769CEEF94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0xF85D2EA0D02A757B1AAEDCA3C609D4FF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0xCCBF459401745FEF8E4955E090F42927
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0xA30A88FD0F8EC4435B4525F1BA772A41
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0x888ADE9D4D23B5530DF70BC8673C9A36
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0xC38CADA2D4D7701A8347C837180EC5B8
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x8547FD729C28A8A9A8EE55088B24E993
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0xFF2FB4369198EE3E53D02685635E5BE1
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xFA151C3BDC033167149F1850F9516754
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x6B2C27CA2DB90D97729523044E64BBC4
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0xC3EF52490966B875B30899AEAB1EDEB5
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x02477B76FC3D9AD6E40F0095607D4E99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x89FED400AB04E47DDC00C9772EE33DDB
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0xFFF8FFE8FDEFD1098BFE5B9E13FE7616

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x78841F0DE104BB7A4265EB3FE620BE6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0x75F7F806934B76EE38841C9C42136A84
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0xB051E7F021842843F557375BC71EC03C
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0x4B1F43193C13432AA31EE01F8FD80951
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x43893E58679291B4D40431B82D492619
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0xD3FEE2FFE6E34769686A6476EA359817
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0xB1B11520194BE6BCB4371299AF59C2C7
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xA3727A032365F1B7B3E21449604543B5
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x648CD067FCC79A2F487189540598849B
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0xCE851CE6050BDE3CF396D32AED6FF5D2
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0xADB551282C50CD368F7B0FF82894F052
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0xDDA4BBA51EEF8D6F7B1B734268D3779F
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0x0B2FA57E9151CFBAEC8ED5F896A7A515
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0xB680A62466D3A1F0256F0A47E5525EE1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0xE29A113CFFFA2CBA6136161A20F9A83C
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x929910DB95201C03FACD48441A61B649
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0xE79D2EA95C505DF314561C4FC838E273
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0xA90C416350696C3249099FCF0FB7AA55
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0xDE5E5FDBC6EA9779A4108BAC68A3047D
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x8E0D29BD18E05D95364ABF7B634B88A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x85C16F4141DB45312D1E094888F86D73
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x0D1C145BEFAE3D5A2C998140BDDBE93D
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x9420421D87E15B98F4D9EDF77D6BC051
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x809789E0487479D0EE7A5664FBFFE83A
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xE482C3376F04BA2FAAA78205BC8ED706
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x673C9EE64FAD3CB250F12ABE8AFA87D8
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0xCDFB0F715FCA15E5160C23281E3530CA
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x18E5C4E4D6DE211D72D2AC0DF94E664B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x169244824B466123F0D03D0E06DCDA77

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x2AE6A72611C8A34E16E603BA3A8FA165
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0x36A4AE6F7F7FC77A743F7B072E7C7812
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x420145C0050592ACE2958548E6F02FF0
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x4FBD250ECEB5EC106F474D9D48D9D0F1
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xCC4847F4E5E933C09B2968DADECC9C69
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xC89AC5D3C7B1758ECC7EECB86D78715A
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0xC8B2DCC37563A064A581270A90BAAF7E
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0xC1B0CCE9473D1A6440B00B40795E0019
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x11E1EA68DB30C0FE0D37FFAB81949568
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x53A104E44F5A9E51AD7E794D3EBE380F
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x849308E9CB058216538778CF7413BAFA
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xE71AB907D0962C89948196035B0F392B
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0x2C4C295F118061BDB1DB4805A3DCF494
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0x8CDFDE191A6D984AFCECCAF1605F91D7
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0xF359222BFB6FFDCD6E3B7B7CBE9BFF0F
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x96815BC555E2B8593591EF36F640CAA8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x32E002FFFCE3C7396F1044488471A49D
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xA9210DA2E98685D66FFFFE1D26914C64
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0xD690DCCD2FBB30AF5A04B98A4EB21B5E
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x48A53144F3CA72278D23452A3B88F869
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x61D57B2FB425E269DCDDAF94C054E3D6
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x063D2AF90864447FD00BAC4BC7A9D58C
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0x080D7EE69311D66D13C29E728BDF20D3
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x77955C4ED8AA7ABD1B5DB44044B943AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xB566EF71D71F37A4A30FB7087DD0C8C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0xEC5C0064CF2D6C0E4F723D5FC9729561
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x19354E9371684B4F2EE6D548FF0CBCCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0xF70F4A7C1414B1CC279CD1E36AEB7AA2
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x14179CB70C1D06E2C73E8C1C0299813B
to all."
0xC369B09AD1261035EA9D3CA85B140F41

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x12287EBAA1284EC36873EB5B565801C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x52F9EAF627AD96E19B9FB955EF23AA1B
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0x963958075F68E151ED955FC5D5C03B47

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x88992D8FDEEC767D2F23D800F9ED49D8
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x9F88D45ED15C92000DF7F4B99F834256
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x5FDE17BC97ED2BCA5DD9B6C899681AFC
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x2C11A9552A10A77B256A9A6EC4D8FF2F
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x23549A5967524562772E7A3C5F1C3DA9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x6E36872EB75480E7A54AA617663A23A3
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x794C01B6FC96D2C56A3B40B8B7B55E49
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x08EE29A2150ABE26BA43120D33B78807
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xED7FA1AB92DBCD4967DB4C762B4F9DF4
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xEB4DA4354B517B0C232431924386090D
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xA75B3BFB843F5FDC8AC6A4FB083CE3D9
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0x8E6FB925CD332E99DA8A8DD8F63CFFC0
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x8B42066F7524D4945C6E2EB204065C3F
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0x431AE0AB173A513E85F1D5A8611A32FD
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x01377616A47AFF8877B88EA776912F81
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xD1A9959ABCEE7FD331E6501271E203ED
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x1534EA86CAE747F5611FBBDCD7A3CBA6
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x8251EB02BD7FCA90EFA4FFB20A49C340
hollow cough.
0xA627AD84DAF123B99145A6E3046D3ECD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0xEF70D02E1F3EC12DB54838F1F1AE0712
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xC9689A076CA139A27D3A92D5B492883E
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x71C34033D88CA1A1B4F5E0A5EE6AD59A
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0x16FDB75409E0105F9442DB329F3C9273
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xB580D44B712F31F5976E210D5DA4EBBC
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x6A2C2783D2858531D4CD25B569421EBD
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x9421CE93B7F8013F8C4B098A46B33A4B
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x2F8B05AF5D075CE5938E20629AF8EA21
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x4C55B66D85BE929B6FAD613BE7A6DCDA
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x49EFAEE1DD71875DED48BCBA9274B1DE
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x02AC9381FC6FE1A948A1DF863941DAA8
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0xB4B23A375D89CC07DCCC3C410E0F411C
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0x9AB63A6163CF2CEB9C6A2E64D13995ED
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xEAED410F4BD660EC856A7D5A33B6EA6A
this inscription:--
0xF6A051882B8AB415E7068F5C7F4A07C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x32D2323FFC7C21C648D67274CA2130B4
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0xFCDD24D6829D8A071251A409716D4B95
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0x43667AF800B3922EE519B77B51D715C8
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x8F5F4B13DD5F404042052AA12FF6704F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0xFDAF66E6365FEF07DAAF85EAC22CE8C0
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0xF7066E0166F403A3B34F6A33B4041595
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x57ED4C8001993A90BFA254A801FE24B2
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x73FAC1DF3B1AB0A15110D76285EF7C89
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x675FD6A245B6FA7455735C2FFF312DD0
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x5F5DF6583C98921C19CFEC64835BBCC3
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x9F453C837F46092146DD0B2CB0DB6CA8
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xDC8D43B87EC3FDCB68E51D9120512C77
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0xEF49CC0383CBA5B947C56FE3E0AD678D
I said to her directly--
0x9B4A62A27C55454CE37DA445DC79FB2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xFC06F5D663BA3E29DE3C894049D4F8BF
her to lend it to me some day.
0x014728BB21A590DED5B1B9AAA166451A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x8DE9B7D4F8863CA5552896673594A7B4
she examined me.
0xF040DC3C23F8E061130141EE76EB2747

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x2783B218419A3A8FD1616D3A3B612E15
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x14C17BE5B66E847F744021D3D55758A8
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x719B5E2862DC5533E3018CB8B6DF4ED7
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x0239C27E97F16991CACB7A6949656195
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x356E1D82EA94521C39749EFCB18CBE9F
or substantial.
0x71D59B16A82A81CE5DDF28E474F337EC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x54003E8D989EE08194CDC8CD5D7936E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x4E451D450672EED13B28CB6906E13D0B
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x2A6CDDCB302362E5B41C2CCB21D0F2AB
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x4CD28BA7788E102C73701296A113A2B7
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x909793C2758B0522DC39271EC1FD76D5
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x11CA8038B67F7B1913AE642BCB142B01
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xEED4865159C7C4FC723C9B92A41D1566

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What

is Lowood Institution?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from

other schools?"
0x4309A59B35666C21CF79DCAF8285F743

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are

everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches

history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one

who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for

the present: now I want to read."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xFC84DA178CBCBBA0B263A42EC60EBBCC
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x16402F5CF022A0C39A7D091853125B03
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x9D158A8EE03E998215F83D5A345CE9B7
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0x7783B3230594D2661E51C3794CBFC8A2
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x0C0FC7848DE51673893021F15E3C527F
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0x99DDB0329CA2EF15E124948F23CBEDB4
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x0072EA687CC395C54AF51BEEFDDB637A
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x241054E6A46EEA5CE1281065C40AAD98
day's fare would be like this.
0x714C3DBD38073A5F654E31F9A5080EF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x2C5A2185D923FD11040FAF2E888D94DD
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x04A0D0149B530BBDDA3891B72F031B94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0xF670F2BD82B3FDC065230933E1CED89A
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x084F5DD34ECB47905C3508A0393F64B8
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0xB6F89E28B0EC779D4C4F26E1C85E287E
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x568B59BBF30318F45207BAEFF8C3D8EA
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x5B371509A553585BC4421E62F177BFC9
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x4572632E40B1EADBC970884411652705
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0xC4614B20DB19E9EA5B9161B7852F8AB8
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xA39234FA4AF61CB40B36151662FAEFAE
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0xD6E98F55198E6CDD0B0E0347F5F926F3
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x060296D425445732D3FFF56572C7D7FA
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0xCEEB6521480D390BA4991E8F7F4A0756
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x6711ADB621303E23ACE093651944C959
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0x991D90604AD222E7BCCFD472B6550F49
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0xAC33193769E08B1928E15E61C2CFD5FA
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x52FB42ED759861AE3A18FD88006670C3
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0x855B47B5CCFB3B39430AD67DE61D1F9B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0xCEBFDF1045F41355CC65D7C97C2FA0BC
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xEC827A934C5E01A7F673C1A10264DE3B
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x685C87318011DD635FD24F3450F0BF93
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x41FDBC3E69419C5BF9881AF5BB0E9A42
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x047198CFC2A6A22AFFC87D613A67AED4
first day at Lowood.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x196EE82FF3D791449347BEDDCCC65B4E
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xB7ADB1E34ECCBA068CA27F6BB10EF26B
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x223B0AF95A21AF2082C84B4EC21A9304
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0xE1A93F1C3DEAB2D319E84311626D3128
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x91F34E9A90520534865D961352C5370A
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xABBA3DAF1A3FF9F41A097FED8B116551

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x071FD492B3BFBFB5E8FCD95E8C92F656
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0xEAA987E33C2A99A2B370992CF1115618
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0xC521F6F90D2861509203002871D90115
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x33DCB2758E42C94CA1A4E96096D143DB
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0xCBDDC8CC93E6535E6A7B5D90B22C2927
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0xD4CE133D297CA85D7831C85BC3E6CD1C
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xD0B606E27B7F2B2541692B7AEE8A2C85
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0xA3F2C894EAD2866CB8789A385A97B67D
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x32477D44714E42A35DFA427BA750F272
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x61ADEA6294642ADEC3B874F9B9AA8532
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x9ADEE1D1B94081B0FAB44D96DAF59A11
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x0FFACD9C25D5440D6512EE84387276A7
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x493AFA9D897E69DC5CB861E092DF9343
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x1E7373D6DB31521B701F63E3370454C2
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x540FCEA5AE10529AA7B8BA735DCBE593
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xCF3B8183965F1969FEA6970D27633970
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x0163F893734ABB7794DF84A83121DDC8
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x24B797A963DAD3AB319EB56CE7085532
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x5D334EB9FDC8221A2BE96B8E78FFD83B
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0x6A2AE9274B821096C109B134DAF48547
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0xF19BC4B0580A47A51A228BF0BCE63459
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0xF24C8084B336DD113CD9D932B30D4C0D
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0xDC33B9DD3A961B2E58838E995DEC80CB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0xE3DC3D8454FD6B81DEBF324EF8636D77
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0x4B26B3EF9DAA358EBC4A2AB2733C8780
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x754582D9CB6581C54E8AB08C23B9427B
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x26AEB49AD963B69C7A8AAF145012DAB2
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x40C0B24F6206CB45755BB5CC95DB70E4
&c. &c.
0x9AAA3D9606E7A746E8B2C72F2E75568F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x1766DAAF28B826BCABF762F814CC6A9E
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x985FB2CEB46736B7F018706A34E9B897
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0x9D1DD01E78D6538735AAC0905AF8FFEF
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0x68DAB59DBC05FE21C84DB8193CBE3265
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x0F8D88042372C65199D06D44D7F029C8
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xEEAF5FFA9E8B3C68CCD45724BF65EA53
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x96EB3BB50AFC919027A1101AED9978D0
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x46EA7350078FFBEC8EF613507F79AEF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x796CC79FE69759B7D1752AA3B91E04F3
morning!"
0xF4E85CC24AAE9B1923CD9955421242A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0xC22B081BF01EA31948D35624A32B413A
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x923178C4C13FFE4A9BE06D268FAD64BD
as the water was frozen?"
0x34D01F67939DC8752AAF21AE35EF7520

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xA734CA29BE7AD2F4BEDC6CA4E7C9EBC5
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x26803664C44074910ABB4E6437B96312
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0x4A6DDD3EDECBDCA04AC64CB66AD8840B
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0xD2835B2BBD416A860F77BA56CCE998F6
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0xB7AFF2CC14F951BBACA431D9EB0A0DE3
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xFF5B3ABA5C2D1B7A7F05EFEC9C22F015
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x0FABF98FDC99D39DC48389CDCEF733FA
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0xF6EFC010008631C6BCFBECF2D15B5F0B
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x88A67DEB58F1AA75441AEDA99D849D25
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0x0F242B797CB06E48D63644AFA4D65E8D
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xA8CCABCB502BDABF16A564156786ABCE
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x2ED8C23645014E3B8EAE16E3E29254D0
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x1FDE0CDE25A43B1E165F8BE4D3AED892
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0xEBF9B3CC772AB90E629FF1734365AA1C
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x01499A0D4825F2C7CCED29BDD666EDB0
altered its ordinary expression.
0xA3B3B52D754231820A0A945BF07CF288

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x52062839F423A3206F32450440999E25
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x5766DB8E6A42E8222626F8694728FF0E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x3A7E16119FDFCACA88E1AD742D30050D
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x28C26C874779898C80A6E54902A25C56
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x7D4182D0DA3A6BC61E4A96E673671473

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x7ADA33023E2497332CDC28E5CD142EFF
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x8F2729B6B648EB6D4CEC0ED21173A600
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x71D69E2797BE33E3E3D737E31E05FC48
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x13CC24E4FB7F38A53CBE884792BEECEF
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x140DC672BDA5D4AFFAEC923AFCE22520
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x3F1C840DB5BE7652CF3A6423DE2EECF4
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x8929DB855E27E8CAF19CFB989FE59FEE
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0x364C2C318FEC918070BD6058A90ED400

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x740C83B6A91087F9D7697352123AAB81
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0xC96EA168D0763F8847C34DE7654D1860
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x02822B9B960D3E6FD3AA0FD74D221D39
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x66425F4500A7DEB2D524585ABF65BAB0
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x11392B026F91106A9FF54F262365D693
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x662ACD335505385721EBAAFE34E790C6
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x4FB88EFB61A34042BC43C5C2384D6080

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0xDD013D4F9815D4C223B32D23DC0BB57D
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x2F7CC837C3BBD769410E05CC0C2F9A99
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x8911683F26B0965B0E83CF43C0939BE2
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0xC14E8A2EF994C0E0F4FD7231778D8384
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x4C516C66029900F86F68E7B7C9B679C3
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0x197B2094426B71191669068AE2A6AD67
to clamour.
0xF6CF5C740EDC56A69429E80EFEBEE76F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x533D03C3EAACBEB2CA0A81DD3BF9D522
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0xED2F1214215A8D80C736A5C52B198BEB
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0xD5366C4D5F092FFDED7078EBC9CAAD53
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xDB8561C71923AA99AA166BC5261FDAA4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0x2E85D474DCE3B308B05B3FC4213F8419

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0xFDD31066F12384B87BFB03FCF65AA930

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0xF3079F572593C66340E33E39DB42EDF4
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x7BF5368DAF949B47D3A912AA7D6661DA
floor.
0xEAF12C618EC2080467052340FBA92A87

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x02DCD4CC96D17D6A9DC9420EA61A05E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Helen."
0xC2188E3A134746DC71EF951D82A56D2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0xDE3C2DB12FA32ED10DA43D712566C1EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x833B27C3FE2E99B8865B750AB1029AAA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you ever go back?"
0x729CF5DE0B67CC90B50DE2F11F0ADF38

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x2EFBFAF7D014843EEB0A94585ADE489B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x8E26A1FAD1B854D850A40C959DE5A66B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0xA6DCDF17140D30BCA7BB29E200E200F7
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0xAEAFECF54946886F3D9929C7C8F53872

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x2FBD50A8840F54122C01D0F91F844357

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x579625A7BF07C60347A6D8FBDAB0F279

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x51A229456846B125FE909610DC183A33
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0xE099F484BEA8E5EB1FC3B8BE89E4BE0B
break it under her nose."
0xD505D6385F6D32C9A26DCC3574C4C6FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0xFF6E10EAF8831F60A1CE2B7A6BA733E3
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x2A8050166FEE420A80172D242B1A7376
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x4E47189986294461644D30E948BACF72
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0xC0CCCD86F4A9E904EA296F65087355FD
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x5424C9225DCAC8D38773B33270DBC6DE
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x700FD370A9431E1F2D13E49252C8A2FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xA07BAED2C397A534FAEAE47C2E9AC9B9
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0x78956C8EE3FDEA004A94843EAFCAC004
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xB1C98873F4DC67DBB252C656635FB642

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x54EF8FD124F0DABD405A8ECEC812F359
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x40BDF97C82FE9D7EBF7BADE6151111E5
required to bear."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xFE5CF0F9F707BC2F25412186ACF11400
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x4328F4941FAE9A3295D75269AE1D6DB3
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x04CD661C8D81900C3F4311DAABD10737
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0xE8F1AC2CB120293005CEBD85110BAD0F
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x1BEE4675D75DA41D93A7DA6C2F2D5536
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0xB18778A9CAB7C10C354028213184DF52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0x4B1718ACC9D55735093156948AEFE334
good."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x564585FF96BBEBB48822781AAE06BC5A
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x637C2DD4613508BBD52B6DF1B1CBE2C4
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0x3351519952A9E695F59CC8E6063A1816
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0xA58549D4A71C4E0D2B58CF05BB9B6BB1
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x1E579ED24C10871ACB85A43621C974A0

0x7DE2F4D1295AFF00FFE3BE7CA54BDAE8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xDA903358AF7C391C6AD3EBF511811A81
addition: she kept silence.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0xA3A9691C569D06B1851DEF49006C35DF
grave face.
0x7D227F2C766E73A1B228782253660931

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x89E51C4356C6DC154C4F80A0600B4E30
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0xFE3CC195F3A1A138818119F778AE1D7C
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0xA3918A251392C9B1C7CE9CB323DBF47C
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that

even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x6E7DFE83E7C6801CF86593EEC471C0C9
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0xDD1DC744AF70D6F55A00EC9821ACC248
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."

"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0x9F318C1FB16CA6D7688CD3AE65E63B25
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0xBB99DCE0623303E77EDF2F75F52B9BC4
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xB4E780FEE7DFF237EC5D54AEFD9E8550
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0xBADFFCCBA32513F552A5C45521C16881
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xB11323711B89FB1EE9BB83E253976BE9
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0xB59889311E552BE4C38413C948D0DEE9
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xEA3178A09E836D2FEFE1BF94B12A8A1D
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x4FBB124602283298A69F087DA026D3B2
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x21B8EB0D5F20C8E6F4E83368DC888847
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x3D5A94A2B5D9130F40E973BBDA0EF71D
answer ready."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xB40436CBAE655B2AEA1E3A65229432A4
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x089DF3B507114EB854A98C46675F6665
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x84114CB3B17E91DF85713C0D356B8BC5
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x3E0258E676DE51499D8F4934C08601E9
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x6AF9942CE1C512E21485C39ADE211C46
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0xFA1C5D559AE23F8C299690AC8C742337
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x61BFE2AAB715EFEA4DE45C7D97D72E41
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x480C7D2BB9AA606EC79608132AEA415B
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x55FDE6D885D03288CA47B9991A6C071E
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0x456C0FC84D839342F863ED7132FA13BA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xD98727B72405B9948FB15BB7F60496F1
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x92FF06BB0A3FA50D2616553B3067F883
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x7D80F76FCCF37FB147039C32A0D45137

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x2438C94529AC161AD43D7652CB9AAE8F
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0xBD65C33197E91E21C30BCFB849AD57BA
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0xF5B150AEFFD560DE4AF3EE84DDB4181D
I wished to gain."
0x638B1AD1CCA359A3CF2FB8249C67AE25

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0x1E3E5211BCC1902DDB9DDFB6C14BA250
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0x3B0A1F46F3B89A141E512E2F5C552679

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x577444D20E8AE04E581A4A01A465C61F
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x103F4147C95F32FEBDCA2FCD1439984B
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x3D0FF2F11B14946016A07DC211CE9080
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xD7F7743061B97D5601D9103CD5BBE78E
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x9A1FF2A81B080350FD934365BC8CC074
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x56256FF61455824C3FF20D18906EE48F
person who struck us never to do it again."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to

please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x8DC0297E7E108A08C6F2EA3F22BAB0B4
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0xCEF170811ED93B5C6A952510AC083FE2
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."

In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0x529F2A664708BF57D7EF829653D3C95E
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xB57E44EAEA52024335D50A265CFF7DCE
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
0x40CAE9E1DC80855B1A899FEEC0CBA1E8
softening.
0x93183439A25EC305D5D2B953674550F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0x004D9A12937417DA964DE3096EF79CD0
remark, but she said nothing.
0x8F978C5920540CFB22CEEAB5401BB8C8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
0xA36C9ABC1CD83B876B798A8F52F275A2
woman?"
0x4484E797B7515DD6C28446BF1C79D527

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x52728BCFD8D578592AD9C82DD77C7DD3
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x82A75EE3A49EFB25D094D6052E3D60B5
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0xCCEAFB05EA927BFC9DF79BC86A923EE5
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x3C43FD8ED5915D79CD62FD17022A9C8F
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x2E63A14689FCA971F619CDD03BF889EF
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xB3739310A17F28250D519A08649888CF
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x148394B277F9BEA32C1A0D2357563B91
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x26F7175EC0375C9A2A141AA484F7A737
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x28946958455E29222CE8A69F73D3768A
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xF8891164ADFE19E8A3841F621C027C5B
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x6E2C4550B782063C9F0237591CED6930
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x7812CF44D4D61F173F52D4184B636656
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x64651C476EC3D01D45E188B912A8C231
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x742C080941B19311CA9BE1ECC06B50EE
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xA8FFF617152E5C1118EF2C465EFFCF7F
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0xFC310D250C56C09CF75549EF61481F65
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xB94B131218278089FEAD343990CDD1F3
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0xC7F993A73A4042187203D1475386209A
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x13AF9131A5C1F569F1E03B984B47B489
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xBA7DD5EF1ACA36A74F5D8BE900781A7F
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xF839D323C7ADD2F1AF92F9DE77F4BC65
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0xEA5BD392F684B2464F6558D2F65F6158
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xB8227C368CA4826B0C0F76C00C7E489E
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x1691CF8AD17AE57F6A90F82FCCA311E1
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xF12BE3095F21B8542E842ABF54824208
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0x5AB72A3FBD806B99E36A4DD4052E269B
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x437CF460965E4832979A5446E4268F8C
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0xDEB1B240B12D97C22ABDB7F2EFE748E3
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xE6E71B68AB98A8CAF4F629682EC6EA35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x21F15E61ECD594D185A6169D7A287EF0
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0xAFC2E0B215955C9F558B7D2E10F1C7C6
without reply as without delay.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0xC252AC25EE1ADDD0200D4807CFBACBDC
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x1B141A79BF91C38AE6A7924CDA88CE1C
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x2843E13D9C6B6A61AD22200C43D3BF14
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0xAD39FF3D85425B66D1B620D934AA44A2
were no trifles.
0x12A4FFBB9D56A8D88B68CCFB415F0744

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xBEB542A65075C60ED79082596C4E2348
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x525126C0FDC5128F2EF48E2B77F36F71
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x92EDE02E47A3F2B8084092B65B71ECAA
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x3BF26FFDB78E31C25522C549F88882C2
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x9C2D2520B76B9E379041873933B8D801
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x461C5DDF3F18C4107DDF9F4311A19D54
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0xC07988DEDD744CFEFA3BC3B53B425D6A
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0x918F1FA20515F3691190F67125382B13
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x1CF198F80C933DC38F2BE3A8149EF587
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0xAA8A497C1CD166051E5313D0FDB8BB13
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xE962F6A97699A1D24D3C1DE223BEB419
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xEB36E9E91549A737B490BF2739126984
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0xF6E4251C04A55C6604D7AC32C1DE4F17
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0xB840A495CD6B1D96EC850D5FF89DE8C8
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xD77B4E4F89A4A8EC6025D305E660F5F2
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x1BCBBA32B98C009927ADAF329585F6AC
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x5B9E89E2C6B75DE77A79A7DE75B16733
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x68476FE4AC87DD92A28412A1DC2A05F4
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x1EB3F19672F2DB7439AD091AD8F0D5D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0xBAA305EE147AEC98F2CF850F3816D701
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0xCAF9DFB63611BA88B9E59798250A89FE
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x6BF30BA9DC95182B6D71E1705924616C
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0xA95006DA10E733C691E3CC318EA9B85F
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x92C28686F8F71DFA0220348A30F85CD3
meals, was served round between the services.
0x71AE976686462EC5E8B57F765EF4A03F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0xA5C6A29A0A98F1D56B42B0D5A950F521
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xBC67E52D753E6BC6E8BF4AE74CA79433
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0xDE6DEC09662B1DC4835E470BEBFC5038

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x5DDB0DD613DD12913DB6B574B4A79A79
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xBBA35D75A02F7E985587B2BD0FFA89D8
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x1794CCAB2AE12EFC383312A3FF535B4B
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0xEAC37F5D6879E514967C859196FDB370
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0xC4FE8B8A2EC3B5BECD4B2D81888DF454
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x5CD24919FBAAA583887B969DEA97CF60

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x78AAFED7334E62F8899DA49D0F15DD25
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0xA07106D43BF8CB5DC7FB7A34D14C338F
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x24E7BD2B82FD3ED4AC0471E5F33F802C
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xB6AA8B548F0C98FBF10D8FCBA7CAC9A4
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x2821D9A76A802B7092811EBD64CC8332

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0xD9E38F237567F8B6CF21E35A69991C67
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x7B3A56B52CF2E383E3CBF23E25ECF553
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xB4AB1AAD7843B3F29E59DAE810B243B2
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0xBBFB41EEF044B49FB6243AB3803BAF9A
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x3C5B004B8F4D95FB952C3BA1E66E25D8
invariably obliged to part with.
0x0E3620B2E955CCA2E845EB1BA177F12C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x35399E6035553A6F0415917242ED6560
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x96836ECD424E277FF2BAEA134C8AE2DC
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xE971052D0D68029CB2D79066C89739AA
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x72D05D5F759D6A3E782B3DFE9183DBF9
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0xB75514EF825F367591062094F0C737D5
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x9872B88AC11A197DBA59D0E363C1352E
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x43924672A83614919BB87C20666D4293
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0xA180E924735D7D7B13541B85BF13C6D2
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x9186D1C7F51EE0D9F742997801425F1B
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x4C9E31D0984E756373183C39C93211F6
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0x2A2994E5156F6592085D1AC62CB0BE11

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x108D45263158580F350DC053BF4C600E
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x81EEB17C1DDA3E77AD1086AB392123D7
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x2BEE08E6EB255259215A6125295B45DB
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0xB279E499ED475E3AC45741F4F3FAA0D6
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0xBA8934B24607A46BEB25D81804EEF516

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xA768816F99C382444BA11B9485FC6E34
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xDEF26F6A6B21712E606631A0A42DB716
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0xD70CB9AF91EB0F9A397EB4F198D38DE7
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0xEA0051F81F8F417DB64CEEFC5CF8B135
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x4964759B6D6A40B4C07F8A987C803BDE
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x4001151A4A193EAF0258E93C716D49F8
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0xD3E68B7A3874B5A3EBF5C5F7AFBAF4BB
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x67AFD91985833F36647FDDAF81F74D11
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xD40AA8E7D04F34AE330FB173826CE948
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x2F08800B1CCC5D0F806B2B553159B7FF
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0xA94326A77482254201DFBF87895B4152
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x7D8821A23EDE3986BA17787C7ECA6623

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0x56C3BBE31ABA21DEE799F3FFEB653A89
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x56D761E69751F9481C13DA327883F39B
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xCD78E1033932B393CF3DB470A8427CF3
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xCDA9BDC72C77B2AFCB227C23145D29FF
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xA450FE660A5AC7DDB2162D0CF30ED2AF
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x6C32654776947A91D6D1F428F54E74AC
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x44E2B688D443B0BB76C16718A1BE053F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x9544EF56BE18CF230C95E5C7FF7AC7D7
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x7CC838254AB7AECBEF0F27C95C5AEFDE
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x6396718A679BA4E8DD33479366253CF8
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0x338C7016078DB9A5733B1D0D647970DD
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x0695E91BC1716BB8C170CA6A9B1B5088
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xC63E6616E625F67086BFB73F53E5FE7F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0xA7BB95056B9CCC0C0080CB83536DC76C
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x6F647B02E7936268170637A9B1AE4C59
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x08E0520C0C17BF44B12E5251BDBC0A69
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x479C83E3909C7B01988880FA1E03EBB6
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0x7332EB65BD0310EB6E2E6D0D3AB5E72B
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x0959FA2CDB3B3CC4066E91DF928F3233
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0xA67BA659D37DCA6AC4C8350ED708D3A6
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x7EBEA1611DD96E30CC511F08B6763446
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0xBDFA30D1FF09CBB47E3740D244536C82
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x1E860DCFC0C5027C29DFC7ABBEFB607A
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0x4A48709B083A77AE4DAABF88BC32AD43

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He paused.
0xBEC677887925D9F70D85AFF631A10FDD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x8B477AF5E270A75931E84F4C9AFF8A70

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0x8F040C50E53B63E2E5F9DE4636447290
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0xC584D4D7A6B4F33610B73A5A14B166CD
to one."
0x4AA02B819DD1833B538F2A630648DB89

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x8DB91F16968A0DD1D3F81E9813C12D28
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xD672CA8A63A02AFA7C25F9A87929D53B
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x13F470FBEE354C41A01DE31655A22F22
occasion."
0xDD99DA033E6148AFF288AE6CD6EA3585

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0xC329B4F48EAE5835A029C9B01484BF87

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xA2E0F3E4CF8CD866CB34F8A601F3061E
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x911916545053E8DBCA0AA710B300C64A
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x3CED62DEE4D9507209ED8B0F16697F79
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x0E8C2DA775A3D65F0224E25C8CD4C6D5
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x2905D750089E24AF9388D567FF746D20
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xF5DBF6785E4D722438828B30B9DDFDE4
what authority?"
0xB53A1778E5E3E5A869AEC986083E2291

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xBC78BD54EF9BA2D1B732A31BACA2F4AF
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x0C14BF9CE6744BABCA7E5A270B2357E8
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x76C0E41FA00EFCE84747F0F277284BE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0xB41932575539B15331A0AED8FA8B9EEF
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x161196DF137030CD306B2FA75DD0B301
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x9B1C38960FA220EC267551A6A750E632
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0xA8BEB36E4B8DE67E053DDB0FC1CB76F2
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xFAFAF8E3C7DDACE9A66661F934C5399B
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xCA6AD12E6F55ACEE6D525C642BE47A08
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x9C7FB2F891B50D5CE8337AADB0342876
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x796E05775A75AB12090201EF84C83478
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xE967A24D789AE14A9DFE93C98DE15C46
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x60D2510E3B01BEF67CF66E23D00DD8C5
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x7FE0516AB8D038842696761C5CD08A0D
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0x88C48BDF5FF4A16EF7614A1160EE8604
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x75C4836C035E3933616DCB84BA53B287
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0xA03D3A3243F60F5515C0D8FAE91332DD
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xDAC081C96B4E979A52123041E58D71A1
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x940D5F349D6327E0D7E2673174E7761D
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0xF4E4EA03E5C8AC9243F8ECE457829C6B
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x6F7EC1DB33DDDE2948E116E25FA3A245
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x0F627E4D46A2CF06F322F4BF7E425547

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0xEFDBFB0FCD2F2182340E0F9714FEF6FE
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x964A654B90AA917F770492E0DD0A9464
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0xB7639AFC49E11849803D592559FF3698
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x9FD297DCF8F592CBFCF0E25830C8CD28
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x91E9208A50E074329AC736EFEC5D1EED
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0xA1DBACA2F4757C68FC87A786E7948106
severity.
0x9D1FCF8D2E6D58A3B6F00A35BEEF80E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xB1477E02A11DF7A2357137A56EE1A591
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x0D315AA8BD437C50F741ADD987CC128A
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0xB7B5E0E34103587F59C45B6C5B784456
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xD1B96B97B452260DC77AC2C9666144CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x02ED54FF05F776DEED7A4D7BE33E087B
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0xB0DC2A454C6DD5F090667A0A7783942A
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x5A2058DFCE2DB6589F24F27C3604027B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x2FB70512D8465DD95C7893C16F6FFAF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x45FBCD3C916D2DFEB69C2188DAAD84BB
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x6B6AF9D351A506EE89E341FC64701211
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xD0EC1C4A61527CC138CA7D2B5713FF47
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0xC4918E43CE5EDD93F351AA802570E631

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0xE405EBE700DF1452B7696A0E5CAAB044

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0xDC68B71170A3B9D4DD76D85B75D553AE
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x4732E69CC4CE118447229FDF35AE8A86
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0xA5B1686786044395729D990E2AF94624
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x349A61297EE941AB557546B70C5B7D1B
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0xB1A452EBAFF8FB283F221DA9C48E6A71
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x432A59FD4C8BA93709D8F5AFE855E3F2
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x2476D4AE3956D583005543FBECFFA753

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x241A7D92A7BCAFC97CB6E4FE4FEFDBE2
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0xEC545791DCCD3A72B40F708CC704E9FD
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x156752F7A757222439230AE4F14ABFC1
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x4E9F239403F25BE8280C1BDFB15D6368
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x0C1211A6A1B92D483C04BD4900DD78BA
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x76812B393A4B61F21D2F27648FF4F00D
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0xD2EC65AECC26A93EE49CF18A74ADFC2D
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0xFD91708A4C3AD331C4B1B60DF6F41CAC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x326039A927A8E33BFFDF0745F1917C1B
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xE0B844D46028B2548F0BB87363C93280

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x76B2E4FDB0873B72F2CF80F9B2EB2217

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0xDD1C189C7EC215189D93A3DFC767C994

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0x3E49ADFD276A8F6C955951F40DA05E1C
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x5E129BD27CE86870FEF6FB6CAE37D1A4
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0xC73A5F49131F0E7C076AFDD5B0B39E57
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0x803772289C30E3CBCF53D5E9FC92E8AD
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x96003269735FDD55670EB562D6338E51
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0xC396CFF770412F3209B3349CA077963C
time wasted, of--"
0xF38811358AEB6D14B4F66E3B4F267B4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x82EA6FBC9C5C095C7277800AD40E6E28
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x956136552316DC0D4997EBD7F6462FDF
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x71B70BF3F5CD41B6CDBC3F6194D8D640
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x95BCAB49889225E1DD2ADDC8856984F7
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0xAD4E35E496A88C9FA21D1C9BB6D145DC
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x43997E65710C78CDAE596C514CF35FD3
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x967A8EB45BAD7A9030CA711966B487A4
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0xC38D0E388E027C12C668697B35475DBB
false front of French curls.
0x201A2FC861C01C35E9C04BCF3A0D07B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x2C72DE6D03D0514378EC650E5F1795BB
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0xA74BC85B4497A300F9B5C63495313B28
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x78E4C2C17F21FF8C748E50600A0E8DFE
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x53442F386A4B80DD753219ECF0ADBF7F
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x9B50D0EFE5894B91861B904405EB1EBC
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x156C7C2081C03519E04B358E3FC38423
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x07A3484ADD9CBBEEB56BDFE6890245CA
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x02E21C61D2C2B09029CE62A1A7D6C447
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x5F0494E08624489185CAE52A9035CB81
my attention.
0x27304A09E0765F84D9B4623AF90A2B44

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x29A95BB8A8592900BD1019DD7EBFAF9D
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x13BFA9604AF24BF2274A29588F378314
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x7C94202303AE36AB9396741D4CAE94CD
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0x4CF7D9420C27FB4D8284704C4EDF62D5
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0xEAA60A15FE7D88953895A04C329C85CA
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0xDBAFA9CBBF27B024CA9561D33A954622
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xFC26968618EBDC526EC1AEBD9AA40629
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xBEB72D8445C50684BB7D1AB6ABC38171
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0xA81A0C660933658F62E72EA4C3943FB4
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x67FDB219660562D979BA24DB3804F92C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x1DCF4F7D1A6941D031E3C8650F35BADC
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x398494171C32A5DA355CB5BF96BAA6CD
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x2E6EC6908722253D60D38BDFAE14F814
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0xDCC560D7D5DD7D30D8FD63BF84D29036

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x31D012F5FB64C902BCA81436B416F71D
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x63B6D2D9EA820AD3B5083A059E2F507C
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x72C3FA03FD72013C7E26DEC4F93863A2
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xFDE3955B610D669BF867DBE9B0CBBE90

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x3A2EF9286977534EE12FFDE4D6BA4ED9
punished."
0xF3194213E71A572549F5FFD143B42BC9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0xF6B6183C9DF4875F9243C095EF782D21

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x640BA67ECC9A26766B20634B688B84C8
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0xE38F2CED76C1C2D6D087705B5BCDD537
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x579A7F7EACE2897389B233D8418F690C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x27C916C03E21F8FA5E290C2CF526F0EE
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0xAEDE8A67F32D3FCF523430CA31B5862C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Place the child upon it."
0xB3D425D61AC25C1261B6AA79E1BA3F0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x6A11C05F210E06BD19D45668EA1FEA01
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x084F21D76DF957AA5456FD9C3590880D
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xF7A02F81782635C8A3250BE01628ED1A
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x8FEFDDDAB330DF2E2C4DCF68BDE6100A
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x75C9F595CC3F1B230413B9F48A4C93C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0xECE130951ADB53C09BD5A264EEA00717

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x082682A8787B03861FE51658A3032FA1
children, you all see this girl?"
0x1285591A3EC7871F7CDBF931B804701B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x98A5271FECF0AFF702B119FB002D93BC
against my scorched skin.
0xDFD4699A76C70977EEA4E6BCAA62E198

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x228D9A90DA75C3D8169B6E125EFC3DB9
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0xB6139603DAF0F9DBCD6D1A541CB25A55
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x78D17FF3DBF2E04B856E7EC2F7EB2FBA
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x588AF38B59AF0C4EB69456B0144123A2
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x066BB6C8C284BB51E7CA9FC137F627EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xD053C2B8AF13CE150CE6D1B982FBB539
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xC5498052C29B0FA5530F99E4DB287C6A
must be firmly sustained.
0xD0EEDC76C806D30EC2E4960619B014CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x3EB7A1B9EBDAA4FB6B47C641384AFCC8
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0xA4B7EFE54E0412516429B5F763773D8C
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x68E95A47BC19317DD486A191E7DFC92F
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xB9E3762CB858D04599F8FC429AF6F71B
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x1A4DC22D32741E35983B48C03F6B5FF1
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x08B8242DEF7B47825E0AC7187A2FF739
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x406F19D9BE25CED7D023A0A7404A1C17
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x859B03FB6DE95D5996AD01EA8056C2B9
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xAA4AE2494F09308A3A0CB2B638DF6E13
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0xEFB656702446022EE1B109064FFFE48B
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x3E42951379537CF56D74057C4A9A40DA
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x72EB256B55DC9E6A168741B25D1B29F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0xD60A046689CFB8DFFD5ABB9D4B98C926
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x6F0500DC14DE37BBB50AD38BFF8F1A1C
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x699E4FDD516C17611D12A8D6804F16D9
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x3ACDA8CCF2E7E6010D687144D79F00DE
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xCDBE13C8C774BEBCBCA9FF22ECB499E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x63048B0146BBACC104FF8DDB2028AF59
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x6AF7B8175002269B41654BB6AB1D4D57
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0x60DAAD3C6D78D090E6F984A1E0790A12
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0x9B945212E96CDF586808AC9EC7FF2C03
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0xD3ACDE02636CFA95A7D235E0B8670E00
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x79602D655A8ABD761809F7475D5BAD27
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0xEA98A4CDB47E3B6437078076AE1ADD3E
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x55CA846BBB6C6177C9898BAA3C14F75C
waters to stagnate round her."
0xE5FD492B238290B9662E8802754F612F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0xFCC89B9D4596630C96527803C84E955B
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x9A45D450DB4CBF0CE88460B60BE47BB6
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0xDFF8755A4346C707659000E9FCDF627A
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0xF5B3AEFBDF1B61B9EB36316E5053CAE5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x5BDC973D328BDC5373C5939A6F148003
her during the remainder of the day."
0xBBDD71F407D148BFB763B35CFF4E8AF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x864DF963DE48B6BB547CBE75DC6A6470
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x78891E1AA08F1C38D9158599077AC80D
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x48F80FAFC8E07BE724CD3CB2D6847F6D
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x304C5659977FBE3BA380F2BC078CECBA
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0xCDA398C9603EA2446129AB60B4738066
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x3D76C331860228F68E195917A9556DBF
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0x2390B9B086A54C64382A4FB85EA10FC7
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x616A40B39C15CAEC8890B74D7BB93992
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x708435B9D36CE97CEE4B80DA77C5CC3A
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0xEED445E846364C1E2DD11FEAA0D69E11
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x4B712C57D3193E99ADDD74D69AC07838
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0xF447EB8601ACE99131015CB71BEC6220
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x406B61E975743E3AA1EC3A4CE161A4B3
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0xADB1DEE952D7A521759AA73B8DE2BA95
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x35CB1A2A0B0BD4192AA210A51CC30A28
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x32D27789FC8B14B32F348703DA83B343
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x0316E5FCAAA816BBD82258AC10E4D5CE
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xBA70F1178974FAD2819D75AF93FB2845
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x75BE6D0752374F0D139CE1C2E0248950
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0x37F7EFF78B4B507B58CB70D94535B0AE
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x3ADEB5F12FB028FE9EFC92EA3E19A441
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x6FAD1BAFA400DD123409FE7AB4CF056D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0xA69CA27F5699D9C614AE9D6D4416015E
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0xCDAAAA87352CBF5CFCB127DAABABB9D5
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x2F0862C12F6FCD58A75086A2ABA436E3
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0xA6927216A5DB75A8DF899983A48F9FE8
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x31611691E654B75E2EB59B85BFA46688
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xAF7350CBD05226EE23D65223A7BC58FA
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x3B73BFE47701ADEC5217D6009F0E4D5A
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x2924B0D1C84584B6BB97844C2683A37A
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0xA40DA4C97F4796EEBE8AF5B58BA24F2D
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x15E8B174FF805CD9906271B6E86FF805
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0xE4E18E028936A60DE68796267FE56767
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0xA5A3A6AFD88E69629E65CE2E38E64C3B
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x56F606440D615FEBF07BB289069073A2
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x6B36EF7DF4807B1F22C266AA5FB8D97C
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x53085BA55F740A47F1F629165AC20EF9
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xEA9A9AA5CB09D8826B1B1C3EEC7F5B8D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x05E98C55B296BFCD2810656522120897
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x5A0A83B4E163D65D841A10CA162C76D2
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x840D4F20CE1B89D017BDE8FF93ED9C46
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0xCF75151DC20F94E2B238751C458D3147

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x05DC754233CA2A06E64B36958592D785
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x5895480FEFDB4A9BF73C9DC44C1D82B1
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0xB2A719C702C5EC4A82CB362F5455B35F
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x5FBDF0F6B5AD18FEEB879CCDE82EA656
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xD3E9587C4493253FA82D7514CFF09E6C
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x882446C2A912DC0421C205838D5995B0
first who spoke--
0x3C1251E2136FA9E0C7B5BAF8E9C33CF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xA6709BE53194B03630907CE2FB0E1F69
liar?"
0x3A3BD8A9DA15B3FDA01EBE4D80F7FCA7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0xFBCCE2DDADC3A9CD7E2AD9A6645F4830
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x25E1FDE9FE8A8851799D0A8B0B45F410

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xEC3E5C9181F18AA79F297BD3A63848A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x4776A8CAF6307E3DC00700C35547DE05
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x0FEC56701BDAEEA149DD78D3C59E06B8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x18ED330C92EAEA8F171C6C1F332EFDBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0xA208814E8F861D1DF16DE437897B76E1
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0xFBF5E6400D8E8D637015A187A8AB225A
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0xFA1373864A8086FFD9A0431DD1B70338
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x5E07448E42B7EBE7AF5BF65981975423
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xE45C1209E4C97874DE6961BBE1A434BD
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x3B9C5CB173B92C32E0DD9DD9E1D3B642
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x6771E2CC678846620640A2D97E82B550
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x71C6B2AD1A426EB17832C176D48883F7
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x67A9610E62D4108BA61048696CF71A62

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0xF9CD364AE4F038B7181463FB2AFF7A4A
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xDA296974993FCAE83495D640B4157A85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x7B22E2B9BC86A8F2569678B87CAA46C9
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x5AAD79C90B5572A86E6C6D5BD0514ABF
without friends."
0x8102F37D407160CAB4FA7D8ED33496BE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x156366D597C8DE5A5ACE2F5F46B5D66A
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0xB466655818F455E7779BF6E7123A992F
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0x118CFCD86A25A672A648E5E5001998A4
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x90A5EC5C88520F657A5902E024D8132A
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0xAB888967A599A09BBF14A2B5EB7C8940
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x5EE77C9FDBA92F049D51B85A866B16D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0xF58D8BE54B7120CD246D7B9AAD7789E1
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x32BE769EDF6D43103AEEA6A0CA753572
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x78535FC05774D51004C0318B713DC2AF
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x3370C53EC0110599CFC053CE914F9308
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x0A7A582613FD961D1C5F975941C73967
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0xD7871D7C662030CF12C7E7AC45A9D58C
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0xA390BC77BFEFE64FEF5F3BB36D11AC1E
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0xB32B13FB91C84CFBEAFA3B685C4A4DD3
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0xB15610DAF5D4EF17B1701DEF28F01DCB
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x1DFA69F1C76CEF4D621BBB0C0296AC78
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xA98D9E2173DD7DB9C5636689A1E9C5D5
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x890424989A25B72E903A73D01D58A180
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0x16107C0FA56E672D75AB934446B88D7D
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xA785EBC636EC497EB8E5C08A6C5BA8D9
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xB4DB85E3AA65C9B325F1767AF799A410

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0xFF02BAE8978C8128D7CCC2ECCEA1DCF5
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0xB22653BFF8B82E2FBEBFC6BECF2973AC
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xBF451BEEB6C9898B7EC07AF71801D741
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0x9050015D0C552AAF1CD46820AE4DCA33
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x046C2BF2AF845539DC0D363F93252FD7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x2E5E39A0AA980312764415F1BBB099E3
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x86A397F3D0B3D281F11F5B640FF703AE
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x65593C2C2EB0946C46E3E07ECB6A2724
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xDF34F2D10194CCBAE051CA5EC0B5C0E2
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xF99EB00B5D455E13DA39E2C95999A0AE
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0xE2DA4A9049D24436A44E8E64A8370BC5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0x9A556D987BEBB5A8A30CC173A97103A5
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x76F4BCB608DC1C5A47C63A2BB5AAE8FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x7B201A106A46C795B62F542E4542EB05
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x9AE92EABF7CEDBB902A77CDF44F30B1C
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0x67728EAC2159DA8BF9FC5A288B95F31D
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0xDCB6213FD5B077EB1253EA0D9A24B623
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0xA5E18B8E722A2EC014B5D3453B3B5279

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x827BD6B466E3F1A08BAD99456F8AEE6D
your grief away?"
0xEF0176957ED0C80D611D285620F9FFFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x6B730CFCEB09415F2E2F829F85D5FE81

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why?"
0xC0DC147323FFEE0B309F7B3E64505D52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x5335549AC915894B906ECF25DC44FB5A
will now think me wicked."
0x56CB1679621ADB924A034C366555B2AD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x4B8382EDD775CE613C875BFCA73E0D1E
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xABAD75860DB603E3BA602A81F6ADA781

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x7BC6EAF2DB941183A5EC90CCAE066DA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0x9EE7941D5B33C4C780DE65477CB71B75
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x6FF8A0F42C8255D0F9974EED2B274633

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x53D80343CCD5AA9D7225CE2B9B5E6E43
care."
0x1F7E69190DBA895947EBC3488FFEED8B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0xA3DC02712E34D07903FE49F631109EBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0x096C11F9DB3B45AC8A9BC8910775E1E5
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x1C6D9B88542895FAE9FF8B38435A2034
always keep me."
0x6F8BB910EAC32F53CB361C1832C7B422

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0x4602F07651B2A9D2F6E30CE8C0948EF8
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x1292A25C857C586A4CD917A91304E886
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x6DB1156A0F1FCA864E040692D3E16442
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x318EF051158F309DB5E2ADCD1EE8EFA7
exaggerate nothing."
0xF599B47C171217726FEE250ADC2D8AA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x4C68125B1013DF2E4D420E6375952D4F
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x5F411E356FAA314ED2BF91EB92E7D8EC
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xF6A0F61E18D0166C65648CE2B87196D9
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x9FBFC72D05EB5540A7029150B6BC72E3
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xD5D8ABE8E3E2FD429BC25601FFF52B85
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x6DA8FBE6A34DBB9BEDE9F4E5AA38C8AC
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0x60390E15F23F82B40F8D01E3841F9B70
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x311B6D3C826AB6C9FED38163AA2EA49E
Temple fully believed me.
0x0EADD7346F24A58F97395BD28196DA00

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0xF294F0E02BD93F3A17AC19CDCF0D2460
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xE09EAFE68E772D7D5720DFAE7E79F520
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x1A8846B63EC4776B66499368FA4175CC
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x0B40D8752A722480BA582D4756AEB212
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x23133BC24C87E2330602D8B2ED13C12C
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0xE07162722126CFCC50EAC20F4A0CF665

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x8EFF276DCAD25DCB3F542BA282E42AA3
then said--
0xF2CCDE7133C463EB6B01AAE32EC71114

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0xC0A743E4B4AF011EF9C01995BD5E39DF
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x0B8DFF97D626CD8B5EFFA7109091DD99
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x91AEE1E09AF6039FB3C701090D8AAE82

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x2F58240BBA918C1D595F9F8EE29F768B
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0xBF8FB01330AA7CD21FDF8A9D72CF7FBA
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x558D1E2382E722CBB4F8DD3AE53DCF67
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0xEE3AAC5E75919E22F637850CF35435B3
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xDBC7E28790A7EF6B2AF3FD50C8866853

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x1B5FB47B411E9A233BB07D6068C4B769

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x82CBDD5D1B425324C3E9DD27B05F214F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x58F87495E057D30ABB78F85F2BB245FF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a little better."
0x9FAB9EBD72903634DF6B70E1C976828C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x51393923DC5953E53D80CAD51C0DFD26
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xE6BE51E64F7F45AAA05737CFB153080C
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x8E74049F923E8A0F860949E9A1923C7E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0x416F2C89AC59E46966C478ACB65D8B3D
rang her bell.
0x8543625F3C8E44AAED924729E12BF7AF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0xE4310B4587CCA0A6607A455CEF102CAA
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x5F7B3E2CBA67D632E6AE6D474F268C7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xC3969B38C2DBF0168E2B7B04E1B17785
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x78E3E86F1850F6681DAFE589532803FB
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0xCFE0B78D2182EBF1E785EB58A690472D
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x0A487B7197DEB9E919A80CC258053E3F
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x74DC4A6A3EDE9055A62E3C2BA4D8F71A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0x9DAC634CCA334F29B853E110B7CBE9C2
There is not enough for three."
0x62AEB9122CE37A0F407670D986E5F09C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xC1DF68CE21B80369B99E57281F2740E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x56BFB4D789E4E95A45E6AF05064C4D15

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x3356D8DF591DB7F9629B0702B3F6EC30
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0xF9EB8FE04337D2A3BC4E021DE82C3AFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x0B658C98166CDE740D2D30B66AFC4DA3
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x3C8A0220DD810F62C1E3BA5FE182F123
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0xA27DF601BEDE645C46CE879CAD0E8348

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x65476F86B80B47D01208D54CA72BA2D9
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0x603DCBB168BC334C9F6416621EE0C200
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0xE3BDA32D9A2B21260C73DA3A3E4BA0F0
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0xE7CE54F1DB31E8654D46F88C92857D02

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x5973F480D91EAC498759D02493B54349
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x0AB412D0877BAD6EFD17B99A6EEAB1F5
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0xEF4CEBE407384DEAE41B3933E6620E28

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x307E933B33C13ADD5D31D50CF71B5D45
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0xA921FB140E22B2802A31D9A62D3F828E
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x29491D0FEE977EC07F766E82CB40593B
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0xE48A105ACAED6A006760B9972E60456B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0x46F60D72B615378FE216E185BEAD54DB
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xFEDFB105464743F713DAB4677C75ACB0
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xA192713320E365361A8E4F8B896225C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x9EBA4E076DB5FABA620B434C4B33F8B2
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x043F3592CEB1A0CC656780939AE1540C
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x267239182B8F8B9A22FFFCAAA16BBFC3
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x406C83BB228A47C4DC00969D03E32DB3
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x3ACE3BB885DF0591C14217B7482E8BC1
struck with wonder.
0x8D25BDEE7D8A5944661E5E1B89848E2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0xDBAA81F42E684401F1C081C2223138A8
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x457F9F13AA0563479BC9D32EDE6DF13C
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x06F73DB8CB162DFAD95A0FF18E18E9A5
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xCCC30EBF3783E768E384A1F96BF8E3ED
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x6B8B9C7195ED91255568E314C0BF00DB
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x0F4A421123D75C05204B239E7CC41221
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0xADE35A07EFD537DC55A913A323AE424F
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x118A9D73A7D14FA5C19ECBACC2B478E4
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x3CFFDB42848F9CA141A674ACF1C96592
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x2BFF1A5CDAAF4D66B5279C2C2E384554
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xC23293977DE8B4E9BFCE0ECFF0281FB3
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xA58BB139FEAB73B57AC4E2628919913C
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x7DD7A602985E1427D3F67E0FF32A93FC
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x89630F8E11B31C982ABD76AC50F66770

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x0C8BBE811C417B42F5D67A7B51784CF8
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x9238BF2A78CA5B7C1C3C3275464E76B6
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0xDBA6C9ACB60372DEF7B4611A1E8F745E
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xAD0C35D240700A2CBCA2CC9176BF7C2E
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x0F9BE318E09F98CFFC1DD3C3BF08413F
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xFD230BC3D57D73449273DC60B51294AE
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x288223CEBCAA9FA449557AF9ED521494
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x800173AEF761740965EAB29695FCA136
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0xCAA153F77D917807F819BE6EE6A68563
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0x5FF37D5A022EFBBAB493F587E862B092
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x3D39B31E91A74F7C2171B79C72A61A7B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God bless you, my children!"
0xD87FAB715C23F1DC6AE5E41335919654

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xD1946817863774A15856DF0DC74A36D3
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x2431ADA73311F1FFA0B0471559A14624
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0xF850ED307B9E4D1BBC068519EBD7972A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x16B2C707E69F7D4BE5D25182D65EF2F9
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0xDB27180224BBA31DDD7D6245581800DA
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x423A062A4CFE6A1115B41EE8F8530D81
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0xBAC564B5A1F9BCCFF2277CBC01C2C7B7
shoulder.
0x1B0736B779FB51759365C9BFB8F44CB6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x614BCA8CF0C4611676F7F4931A2C32D8
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x3365F5D8E946539180EAB88118DD15E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x7A057299BEA6174FF15ACF78900A8AAF
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x0368A194D680D72E8714D6DECB0AF293
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x75AFC4C7EC6B6B4911CFD259F1BBE16A
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x2D620496A9C1078983E07BB6606F66D6
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x4E3B7317A51CBBF33EC7AF8BE42C47A8
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xB91E203CCDBBBD1ABC97E9ED6F5554EE
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0xEE47177F53745095058149AF7CFF300C
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x21544FFFAA85B13763188ADF7A4CFBDA
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x27B5E05EFFD039870D8834A93B690F59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x2689BBE90A8935A0FE3A741E28DB1DF8
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0xCC24674A7FB0AD621D87B7F449317058
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x03390E033FA23E6AFA4584DEEA0921B4
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0xAE8BE949CDB7A5647C235E822C6E52A2
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0x1CCA016C51D00BB301D3F0FE889B7044
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x26F515741DA34804747157E52E690612
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x55E685F7613E8D99AEA23F17568C724D
through the ranks of my companions.
0x8546CABBF61A24B01793FD1EF6EB6DD5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x142FE30CB3A1391FBC3C28A14FE220C7
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0x59FBA0FB1F91C94E712657E127CF299F
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x7EC80AA6F2A5C89DF771D7DB8E14B36E
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0xBACD213ABED63C829D1D898771A08ED8
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x84D97013A56BBE59466023901A59177E
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0xFC59D596943682E9AACABEC45B883867
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x06DD008160B1ED6CFE2A21F065124E61
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x1F86F583901A6D1B5D4641A6AD6A07AF
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0xDAC28CB907883FCAACF0234E70249687
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x43266AAAA2DF1F14AECA45036ECAB60F
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0xBE53B24CE546ECCE53E2AC90E917D2F5
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0xA0E4BA0119ED4B5C61EB50EC2E3497FB
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0xEB19BC4DE4AE9ADB74C009F9A51819DF
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x999BA0243DAC6B424B463F3DCA3C55F1
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x4D645653F13827E8FFA138CB5592A5D3
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0xEF5AD831D80256957C862624A4424180
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xC117C8ACF4F95C50693EAB4F75C72541
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x9CB931EED7912E93F122E090448A916D
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x232967F4139FBECD18D9592D78457E95
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0x4B0E1D69D9B64445B881441702787153

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x1C09130819721598DEE7B464E1B02816
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x5DA1E673286141031611D99B57B28302

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x3B44A673682F2EC8D0D14C9DF10142E1
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
0x6F52AE6235B88D0DFD81E7E9038093BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

CHAPTER IX
0x7E4B0C09B58979A18638D1D2BC1D87B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x609C2A3EC62718EC5E08E953AC1A48EE
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xC4F2789AF119A8E9A618A0845BB698D7
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0x16ED463B4F0689278ACF305469FCF41A
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x46F454F05943D070346292469F7E9231
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0xFF5F247A3900857BCB344903E1452D7D
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x329ED785142C154345BBD14C1CAB392D
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0xCA62F349EB62FB329397506283CC61D1
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x30EBBA49C4E12CCE3E7F510B4A9CA63D
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x8AE8D0C427C8111EB96072C0A70E2CBE
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0xA59E421E8541296ECB69E40D31188469
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x9E046395D680463B36919D6490E0E28B
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0xF13308C84CACBFA7214326E0DF380DEA
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x8F1052A2AA3DCDBD71AD13DBE6F8B714
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0xAF07EE8FDB9C20EA943D88DCABEDF731

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0x4013757D1931D81A65D68FC22C9BCBCD
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0xA1994C37D1BFE94CEE8B15BEDC081BD5
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x0759A9D1DE1A56170098E1263863E0A7
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x4EA1EE18E72570D910E0E41E135C8D3C
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x171DDC35ACD537EE51468CEABBEA9817
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x7393F0D204E40B4C805436A8D933DD80
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0xDB16D8172D3153E847DE92A3635A9C92
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xD09E512AA07BF9FD621BFA1E61BF3D6D
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x3D3F3E823B6974001D220CBC13B99BA8
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x7326974A26E518817CD58100CA837B38
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x14466CF82FD5B0736543C658354D663F
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x098EF80087A0FB9C0520F804C4A8F5AC
of skeletons.
0xF312C3B35B101FA175C09AD02B95005C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x82F020BD3F06E7A74CA9284C9283A0B4
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x731998E75F0A88F32E86C51F395E74BE
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0xAD76A107832A5D41320506D3688DA505
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0xDB951FCB60DD59314AF5AE687656196D
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x9EB66CFAD6688696262A36C57B748026
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0x10B435956BAEC6C4EA95F3BE3B714298
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x17852A88038DEEF7D684C4916789FE04
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0x4E53B07D5C5E071FD3D14BE403F2328B
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x94615075A3C404336561DE9207A6E5AA
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x144CFD254CDA7B635B35E20329614658
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x22F59A3145F46A39BE8C21FDB3F01F25
advert.
0x26135BA71B6C3E308E43DA2894667D45

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0xAA293094CF9CCEDDD438973998C1DDAB
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x3E2D80EA2974BA520EE1BEEB9EA41C89
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x38810644E7322F578A40D5643794F866
question.
0xA593C9DD6E778C0CCFCC28D02C47244E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x3DCCF6EEFE85400A05F94614393FB3BE
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xF0BC5DF7CC5AA88D352B0798D5779E65
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0xE2FA3BBD78704E873B9806D37EFD383F
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0xBF776E5E773902CAEB31C3596707BF7A
hospital.
0x109970737A4B504697557A924C166F74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0xEBC8ECF8DC15BD9187FCE822978303A5
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0xD6EFF1FBE04127D325014C8E255A3A22
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x563FB53D910FC17B439B26BD29B87DE5
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xD650ADCACC5CD67DA51D62AEF2CB4474
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x7C020A693EE2E58898B85FF0A4C707EE
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x5C0396BAF448F251D6262F139A223BEC
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0xC39285825130025D9D54A9E4A7D39637
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0xA2E10016F3B21C8228622B57B188C9B1
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x4D0B0FDF349685E268C5AF47541337BD
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x5F67252A7B481E9A5FD9332A001836F7
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xEDCB7D26973CD938E640EFB5F3B03F76
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x152C553795E19C85A9027611A4660A61
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xF95EF298BEE5FCC41659FA371DFD04C2
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x5F2FD4D6EBC288D20FE1259B0FF227D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x6571A1B163C55B6CF64974FABF5DFB9E
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x0ECD2AD913E5A61692BB51A1D967EEDB
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x917D7BF691696815182596A97AAD71EC
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xAB6A6991B870F04AC33748849E70098D
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x6113993DB70A5000A1666FFDFB8CE121
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xF008699555DB2C083F218913E2990E3F
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xF250D50483B9B9038EE649058BD525AB
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x5FD2C1B231CD7833FB07BB371B67F7F4
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x209B347B730504846DB4D5AE7D6699D7
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x82E814BB6E3551B7A3D226605F396772
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xBC41A8B06774B1160E8042712FC103F2
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0x3319B5B4FA9712D42A46A97DECB68122

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x731E440BEF9079414BCE922AA72D9551
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x44A77D40A73A4499A9B2EA112B2F6B21
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0xA6CA332A4127C79FADFD9066FCA7B430
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x99891F4A0AAF117E7F9F86442E0D4C0E
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0x81899159A3C00DD3F18C27097E8DBDF0
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x044CA1AC60D81C81A90F01735A2757B1
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x0ACF5CC053D434229C753B4F04502413
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x77CA5ACF352B1B2A89B1527687111946
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x0909F827CC29B2763ECB79F306143063
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x15E0988F5667199AC778AA2B17B915A4
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x2CA213E50F13B492009818C2A541519F
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x4C0FF619AA1BFF3953B47CCDF8EA537E
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x28293037DB6FC628292F7304180911FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x5DFD82DA43EF2BC409FED80C7093443C
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x991F4811EDB3B1ACE907BC8DFDC6656B
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0x4D4223DED967F9686F145B89FC29E1D9
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0xCD7ECC78A6E79090081616477C627BE5
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0x5CABD323672642C1A237FB2A3D3D8A74
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xA737D75928A0BB7F56B7ECA94D32C0C7
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x71C0C9BE02D0544CFCEA20E5F2245FDF
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x2E45EA90F600B6E4EE919C2A8B841988
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0xC4E01E82A7F54FC90C8BEDEF4262BC08
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0x04DFDF74E4EAF4180D8D289B7BA56B5E
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0xDD43AC518773D71CAA95F4C54F7B020D
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0xA6D210D92F6E91F01696837FF951CDA2
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0xC9078C63757A60C53EC24B9C37FB54BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x1AF2A4ECD7C529D12530F4AC9CC41A99
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xFE951409784225105F4337A9F6F85DE9
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0xD1296A5A88480EEC4C9397524608F26F
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x33331C8940E4A0E53014199389467961
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0xB1583A8F2C200844C14F2D507C6E5BF9
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x7BC7B8ECCBD843237D898F8ACD996FCF
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0xC4DBA84B90F7B4B51820EE9627E53C3F
higher things.
0x16CA6BEC0DC20649C67A0F69FF75A7CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x7A052A48EE40F2EDBE4B394CA5DE12E0
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0x4AFEBB71429F2192C994424AF044DF13
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x6B6FBCF7488DE0EBCB7EAFC230006813
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x16A0A990DFEA0377580BE435D700BED0
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0xDEA78B621406631E5111927E8D83E27F
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x9244BA7FF8B1127BECA47DA8F286435E
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0xA9439B946C0E2D98CCDF48AB3E346D58
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0x271C4997BDAD738E5696F461C713F758
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x67A81D48793C61ABB699B4C1D1E27B9F
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0xC3837680FB7564872C7C986FFFFC13D4
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x09674420F80D837BE4F3238B9DE97EEC
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x6F13ABA4BD6AAC57C2D8B5D6A6F7023C
alleviate.
0x74826DD26ADBA968A0B4D33AFB3F7A48

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xC7DCE0EBDB5D17E00DFB40FAC5E8DB67
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x727F439134F5D238FAEE1A53D629045C
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0xBD748A7EF6D87D535D916C2583E985BF
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0x7645E87A502079257849FFAC94846BB4
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0xF199ADFE65549E3D516E3B7EA6C4E0FA
verandah.
0x00EEC22DFCFB836AA7D27320245F2A9E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x04AEC2E2B618457A4C272475458C21B0
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0x54000FAB986BF3537F97F4F75D55D54E
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x4B6AC6C703C5141605BCC90C05CE52DA
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x76C687C0975C4446B5E199EC24CD4A98
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x9E504498026FF1F25426020A9FD7EE40
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x601AE2B8C722EBDD515E08D6CCE4A65C
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x87DD26F80BDC750628EE428C171E1E54
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x8A46B390A9F4BF7D3480B2AA288FAA99
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x29CE798E0CC8A9EB3875604B602B5CD0
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0xA06261301720081CD0DE99828D8C5763
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0xD1E5C38238CADAF6FC67F9A2AF87A084
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x0FC753ABAB44EDF76A67438E8EE747AA
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0x7AD57E9A3E3CFF70A663DE1C51B207C1
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x87965E4BBB89249C63D09CAC97178E5C
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x9CED6FC10481E329E3DDF3179C657D1A
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x65320D2A0CC391217D63344B64427A5B
done before:--
0x406E0B599913D2A4CC7D52A4DC7E8520

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x469055AB011EFC7DCE5D6BD5E2AAB620
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0xBC88435E01CBFC769D4C4DAEFAF07839
have to go who knows where?"
0xC1030E29EE20D3968869FC405017B534

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x5B69C5E7276169153EAB21BEB8ABF96F
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0xAC155E07542828D773231B8EAF224D8E
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x5D844050DC8C2F74CECC63034360B04F
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xFC6451D1103F07C28A8A216FBC660BCC
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x3FD66668493391A53D93C49F30F3623F
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0xDE8BB6E542EB019995C4F71229DE9230
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x19DEEF815D5D8102DAB07C4D70D7C57C
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x1DB0E7FB3E8435F53956429DD241A595
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0xEDD98FACCCA0530812E06A3AC90656CF
ran up to her.
0x1C538FE0E447AAFA21471A39DF93F94B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xB173313FAFC0EA086177E6475173FCD9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xC712D638DF384FE1243E73F3C61A07AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x25E2EDF371D067DB8777641199699991

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what does he say about her?"
0x8AC4B80DB530200908866EDA021E219D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x3EB49AA00C0745B23F45B608C35CF9C3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0x3D5B73A572EF072157301F1CA658A7CD
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0xE3A0AAB47A0EAD5CEAF701557AFD3C0A
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xCA5B44428D2F5FBDDABC0AC2EBC01C34
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x91EBE742CE5ADBFAE03E2C4BE233AB47
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0x7B8C894C640277AF899202BC2E88A23F
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xCE427AC8A5A19B8899B067B55EFF6847
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x559513DBF46827D66D7DAAC894D71AB2
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x9CAF06D968D09985CA40821AE5654AE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x78C331A4A9D687691DDAE016FABC1F8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0xACBB8B3AD42A1ADABAB7C5E373EC4254

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x7B774F3F8383ABBC56B99658E84816D7
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x33C145E8AE5216FDC177CF621C5EF02B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x594EBE6A7A783B771342A369C266496D
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0xBB3BD1FDF0FBD3DFD6501DEB6785AC59
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xE972A25047E4A39141C6C5171C48F523

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x9D2F134581E6EBB23D454BBEF186743B
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x948DF6B3FF79F7D0076BFC212C27B357
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x038FA250494C163C40CAAFF6C6EE0147
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x501A105D38FBFC36C25644660E683845
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x4D1CFB002250A83259C703A0198ACFA3
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x0E732ABC312110E4C235200BF6C6D06A
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x4943422BC4FB6EF6356645AC5A7C7002
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x4B5F39B98461D10191DA2FE71A48A588
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xB85EC46B40383D6BFEE72CE1E7EFBCD1
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0xA59E6D40471CE9F4744BCEF2F449C8A9
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0xCC7250C7B8F2F60D8EC60FE79B715D07
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0xEF63964364E5867B35C7E07DC6494693
with her one last word.
0x595197DB36E6D17BB9D2BD7CAB3A67E4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0xD0592EB9B19D8D1DC0E06619D438D9B4
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xC4E6F8CCC13B06EB998A1E51CAC55070
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xAF155F4E9024109FAB2200F0CF9D6E5C
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xB4B20313966B2F70E71EC1054177CBDE
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x88F0B72E06262EC4249D8B58527A5FCC
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xA07EEE8CE53DCC8C2BE500109641675A
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x668ED2206EA89C5A584F99E545E8782D
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x41FCF707F5D29E791ADF76E727388092
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0xD50EEEA0179E1E1CAC340F20592461B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0xDC00FE78EAAF0DBAC64D45B797FA1F73
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x670C227A06A5908D8EEFFB54D324D119
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0xB68EED077A2CF35A916F3E2FD3B95A82
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0xB2796C2C3AA12236B1FFA0C85155C437
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xA1FB3317DEF862199FB73D912B1663F2
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x0AD0F07D6D37519D098B386218D35D2E
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0xC483C028CEA023B80E3C897363020A46
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0x46D97365DDB00599EBE37C9F94D470ED
of seeing a corpse.
0xC6125FC7667585F4578F83D069789EF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xBAA3EA0D0A338AA9BBBCAA98ABB69C4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x84C7F6266A11CCDAE9A88EE10CA48A26
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x60F2090563A6411A306D302B0E012181
instantly dissipated.
0xCAC7A48860007632F9AF887AC54D7E3D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xB003122D4A5FEC8D85919F5C9C01A294

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0xBDB4FB8E8AF355880649A2097A84E9DA
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0x0EC90C9BF42B5FE7E342407A27F24C0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x9B75B28353037DD8ADD7260F5B24FABC
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x4C4B5438FE6E4CDE81C55F47894FCECA
old.
0xBC058AFD75A75EE428F979C08FEB9A29

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xB2CAC6552862A28D61EEFF40D4316910
strike some minutes since."
0xB6F1A6C70678C8EC168A85E07C59A22D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x6B0FDF505E1A193D90058E82766B7A6F
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x58406318DDF603A2ECA5CDBB930AADF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0xA909037BF59DE825A19538E6FCE0A0E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0xCA858A606673C661A89A16A3502F7759

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x05B5DB7CE1742B056224A554159E983E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x45E3DBC2A6035A2BD5AADAB6C789174A
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x907D5686A461D404B0499B5698F2BDCF
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0xA4E008623B3B77A8AA301F73D232C2B9
whispered--
0x308AC8D4826EDFE7630D93511DFDFE1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x53D99337F853B1DBB94C8C13D9CE0007
quilt."
0x0C6E151E17F2172C50DB86E328E97B54

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0x806AC4175A482E2D8BC75934A2B0338A
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xB2E961539425BCE3FF1A65BF9CF46FEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xF3B21864EFE612A9E0AFDE0636774487
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x060C98A82F9E8C4116BB4281CCDD7615
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x63F9DCF5CB2436218F1C0C98D0B21E09
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0xBB7613C6FEBE198BA948141D93F30F7B
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0x759B9EEA23C5093A6EF418A6E594E855
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0xEB9B82EBF562C5086102551DDB6541C5
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0x2A67CEA70FCB260868B1AF9CB6C75128
been continually at fault."
0x765225E1A801BC326FDBAFA74640E4E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0x7493EC3CCA9A652E6CC6C30EBD0F19E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x3CAB4C6B1D8EAEB3D3564E768D072CF4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x40A4E8A38E926C99ADE115580B8BC9A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0xB27019126445004ED7F6770E1C1B9A16
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xBB6F878374AF67A6D820116C658CC976
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0xB5B49E21B02E94336654E38E2C54D74B
reveal Him to me."
0x196AD2D1DBCE6748CA17BC237232CAD8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0x0022DE518A8332B0379411E9FFFFE867
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xDE4E77A831043FAEB5684BDC78F18107

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0xBDEC2B8ED24F48181B7C09BA6D35FFAF
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0xED5226EB82F60F74CBD0039DA33E70E7
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0xBBACC68BD85E43384DDB40A46AFC52F8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x9E2B690D56648CEE6595DF386E963A9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0xC8112C8240BB13C55C2D617883BDC28C
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x4BEAC02887C96A8A497B7510AD39CE26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x96C9CCB831B267E0638FC68C95915EBD
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x3B37E73698B11FD5FAEA317740D7CF3B
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x0D87AE8105F89920D6E0AADBC99C2233
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0xADAF3C0270E981E150B18ED0D429AD69
tone--
0x642BFB3CFF85671538611EAC447D5ECF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xAF61D4706363A98583744CAF0CD7CB04
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0xA5E37629B67A77BF26FEDA5A01721E31
near me."
0x075E2CA2C99204E94A33E6FFAC2EF298

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xDDF853BFCD690BCB376AA0E6700BE8B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x238708520D414C29DB530103A888805E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night, Jane."
0x23C0000BB6593AC08F6662D0658D306B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night, Helen."
0x818CB3568F97FE42E27C30D0861DE01E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xC2C924C690CDDF32EBD9F46EB934D66D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x5FAA0C11F75A1EEA3B0431C2179AA750
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x9DB7CB0D587C3877E81E6FA86C040D42
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0xAF896EB863AC10BA6855B96679482E5B
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x88A39E298FB250FD57D3E63EC1A5BE7F
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xFCDE5566C09428C5D1DCE7CF30C019CD
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xFB148C147F7F54FA422733634444A758
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x602D2E0B718498242EA4446764409F4D
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0x6A82C6A23B3CA4F4119D34B449608816

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xE9B9FD3CCFA2F0806054D866C53CFF0E
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x5D96B8070531A1E176F54D4972FF1600
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

CHAPTER X
0xC875EB7C85E6D7FF29008F5C7F3EDCD6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x67EF0EEFA9DCE9ABF0726F9F38F7725E
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x6AD04C524DBE0ECD576288591A9368FD
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x9CAECC822B9D101BC6EAA9A80D013A2A
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x796F8DB0D3D4113927E94AE25D790F03
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0x264D098F1610A6901A9AEF5AAF5B686B
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0xE97F0524A64E596B5F9ABA81ED3823C4
connection.
0x693EE5F5930B5F4D2950F7F79FB93C86

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0x963F33F2491B594DE1EFF53F92A4FC1F
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0xC9939BDA8F9FB4CCA1CC954C8F518FC1
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x500066E2386BA3AEDAE15A6F1D725F61
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0xA42D7BC384BDF504E8FB7D9EFFE192BB
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x6C9DEBE7B740972EA752619CE15794D2
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x32725C41A0CD49861A5D8640531E9F15
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x933FEF8182BEDCF563C5ECE801B5A617
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0xA9792BE6DD2F853A185529801F10C27D
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0x48016F64B2F9DECBDE9D4049AB910B40
beneficial to the institution.
0x5E1AD583221AB72A365A57C24C1F88A9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x4D97353C7B45758F12FCF35D65B25CE7
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0xEBD45D0FAE7A53FCABCE89F8D53BDD72
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0xE7A4F5F5BA65471E0844FBE51A6E0ED8
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xE7890BE9B193D474B89985E84EECFA4A
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0x2EA3F34FF220080C396AC350BA176269
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x1EC794C761AD99A91BF20AA5752D0605
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x20706296A47A7A31A301BC6D26AD23B8
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xD4B148FBB9A83F999DCACF4B7C9C4E64
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xB4141F441931AD6A4528344A3F0330C7
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x40B002E19FA5BF94F4815B5B81D038F3
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x2B63FFEB6CBE33BFEE3D9190DAADD66B
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0x605A392B31969690C0C8362BBA485FD3
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0xDCABF01DA2473D061A75634B5AA57439
testimony to its value and importance.
0x3BFB0E540AF9643FF18773B80CC6E544

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0x947E84D44AC7FA48784AB4C4E9733127
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0xAFDA94967141E632A390F4B8914DEB55
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x56C3F2615DD37336E33B398261A3F703
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x0FF86F37DEB05E13D8CC9474A0D5A467
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x26EBE95E5164CF19FD411C644BF893E9
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x7455F85242B2492D0EFEB5BE8B00B2BF
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0x52A6318DEF4235FDCBDB2F63E75C6B9C
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0x273DD75E28BF0AA898E791B83CEE494D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x45C5CEAFDD01261DE00D170D3358489A
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0xCD5ECBE21C06ABD95082F00F1F9B1FE5
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x41D5A3B5369A9E5BF6A20CFC6103D781
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xEA68D8C5ACF6116AFFED1A9E12B216F5
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x1268C47DA9631B444695F43FCFF699B5
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x81BE9EFBCC42A28710F7B5894EF8538C
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0x6B132C9D18DEFC26AB9E8CC5BD047818

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0xC6327C28AEDCFF55F609B130060596FA
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x5E4B62338F50F8BFAE437ADDE9E67A99
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0xB0405F4190F6B0A997D5CB0CB18F9911
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x5E02066CABB0F7F9A5CC60616E9094BD
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0x31AD4B247D07F7FF5D8D818B8FA7C6DB
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x6F435A873ADD7DCC472B7F5F5EA44FE1
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x9705ED4AA08C5746FD86A3B175E8B9BC
character.
0x185895D83DCDA7780DE33067E7E03BA1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0xA31894D17336670F711503916F7AFB3F
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0xFBF373C24AE05D62DFA8270AD279D81F
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x2EF888D857B5D9F81CA529B1743023EF
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x0F4AB609DCFA6787F2EF33A03CABCF5D
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x2CE746181DFFAFF80A8EDD46FACB087E
of the occasion.
0xA772104A0441E30884576849FBC52D17

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x4FF493A6C3517CA9C31E43B5F2787DEB
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x36ECB8FD9F76D9A9D67B8D903227D021
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x266CAC9A4ADE6712C64D5823FA9C9036
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0x44B5C94DD9E748748F52EB19D8348EE4
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x02F52B7F41FF635F35415FFC7FDAAA30
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x94F279A2456439391DC7C649E571E52D
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x3E317A09B6E909E2A682B4F035E27C1B
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x550579DD20C245D4B7B19745077F3CEA
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x6EEE65643948F11F28E13E7D439C764B
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xCBC6F07CD778B2BDBFADA8AABAEC60BF
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xE0AA84B125A618F2EE0BFDBED39A20A6
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x533DEE8D815CB4840C2FCC56221DB70C
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0xDAD7CBDA7C6DF22540361D347FF52006
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x9F6A8E27106FAA19B84EB8AE6B0E2418
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x85B0631D65C791DEED249791A590D18F
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x3D5A77160EBADA3DD786623938483794

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0x136A2B8951640E2B1370693E0B7F0811
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0xB6E1CB7B390C883CEEEBC35439E9C675
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x74A00AEA9FF611A63FE57FCF28C283B4
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x1FF6AD80B61D35437B1BDA4948B0D6D2
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0xFFAAA866011C182DDC316317DBF88E9E
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x8D37AA956FBBDAF37834F217C138F3AE
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0xEB9C74455B69E5F7D20040D2DB87BDCB
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0xACCDECB6873AA577CA240986C2D42C7B
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x78E9627207E5B4C2EDAAEE50BDAA8EFA
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x784204C01BADE67C349456D435B044B3
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xE98BFD36863CE309C3FBC27B67860A56
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x10B8D6AEC0DD7A64A5367C13CA204A76
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0x385CE3D196C745E969766A14D2E278BE
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xDC7D90DC5A088A5B577DE53750C4EC74
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x20D076FCA56E8A831C82160ED6C21878
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x7A506770745A2CB82A12EF8EB0D8FC18
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0xB55B7E16756D4F7C985E660FD3AF4E32
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0xC710EDD24AE0EE031A3B81F678751D10
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0x3E6C34AF442ED154B346213C7684BA1B
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x0D57744D86E201407130EE92ADB3B4AD
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x324AEBE80C066A4C0792F556013A36AC
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0x2B31D11FAB0EF7D289BE027C67B604D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0xF92648B5CC80F5A70761A7A7430534E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x87316803D6765D13154A2039FE48DF19
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x731523520530CD606B2A4ED544E5C1F8
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x54A34AC3BCD91D507B976E0E0FA4ABC8
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x8DB92800D3761C57F3FFBFFAB216CB8F
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x08DECCF730F6BD03399F085F9C16A13F
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0xCB8B64023EA0D727A155E09485D43091

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0xF2CD48AD46B90548112B5E16A0FC975E
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x11015BDC5A52033D4C90620A96DC6D73
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x286C67CB7CC5D55CDAC28B88E6049EDD
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x6D9BFF1D4A097A7EC6A990534DDB1715
instantly revived.
0xA8774658256B2BA289979A93BA83608B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0x626AA2B9D90CBE8FA537B12A0B7FA6F3
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x47C1299FA2793E6E45AF14C6CE42084E
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x86DBCB935CF6D12759287303EB5E997B
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x39E5FC57E5195268470C93B604A5EC81
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x82D7953AB8D9BD849014AA647B0C4FC0
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0xA06E18CD2BED4528B62A3C60FF359EB9
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x3E930C6559D235A27C79270F0AD53953
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x3A29CC112ECEE4C1707A35572FCAD525
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x4F4E62A7EE20D5A8D861EFA312907A7B
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x0F473689DED912718E7C9F9092E18233

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x3CC823D9B0946533D29A4BCC431342FE
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xAC8436D1ADBE8095763580F67F59560B
think_ again with all my might.
0x3E000A48AE0E49A5CD4F7410FE6766D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x827360B9CBC60F96F2274B3684B3D4C0
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x405D429D5042E2B6987A893215AEF6D5
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xEBEC7F512DA0E8B418C8CD03B76E6A0D
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x5789EB8A66DDAEA002BE9520A5B32573
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x46E1F5D4106C8DD79CDBBB1E8AE7765A
their resource?"
0x7C480964EB43C09A29D0613FDFB054DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x9DB3F5EF248830975074E7B06A0795C1
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x099AD3D8B45B62F36A956B8AC3F7C078
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x6D7822394CE6B098E36AAD102283A7E4
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xE85A87E6B383127976912BD20AD0F6BF
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0x34F854C315584B5F4095E2ACCD3AC3F2
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0x63CE1295DD87D6CBB3A7E9500409EE1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x0FC4AA10315248EF738A5576B0B57676
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xD753A59E166C28BFB586AAF01644BB52
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0xA20C4BB5762BD7E1E35826870982895C

0xC1DDC22DE4CC19EBEC4315D0098EAD0B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x4AB9607E404C53C26510E965127F71AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a

0xE8E14BB1569C839A102B362C001F82C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0xA699E047B34D4524ED2C4D92DA6FABBA
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0xF5ED3671E9B334EA27E430FB4377FB40

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x8A5A2E81F6BF43818F597C4219AE26E6
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xCE281C66C7A0040ADB488CE9F9A2DF95

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x08EEC410F7716ECE84D5FC364679EC4C
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x761BA2E1973039B341800CE1250547FC
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xECF37E31AA3A30B1A5A70BBDD5E85306
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my

own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0x63C8F4BE6A1E286991D09F632066CB24
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x3D309EB2D6415F4972D3730D32C028F3
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0xF97FA68BC2A779AEC73FBEB3F18BF97C
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---

0x23B18A7DFE722EF610574A37DD715143

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xC075BF490FC2865CC1B97CD8200E32E4
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x5E58AA39D15BF508DA0233A5130B251E
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0xD8727EBBAFAD8C54F7C4693661B902C0
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x268E11BC84EDAEC39C1753368E154935
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x5B217BBA6A2C68A2ECAEECD81E732A58
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x694E1D2BFFC4328383B0DE987C7D9B4C
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x42384FDD4977C7FA900A1D69C894AAA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x69BC51B65FD8EFBED0B81D31B7CB1F09
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x0C15B330DCA10F55B050E6F2030654A7
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0xA11A516F35B4F204F56EF1E9D1ED6A68
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x77E32845F34B7D2C54633CA093220AB8
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xAA76225A9D439CF1A54F71FE77D3ED35
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xF867950E46B29D87E17F01DEBCC438EA
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x80870EC318318CE596F56EA4F893C1EC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x8254BC8978E5E18BAC4E77A9D2E745B9
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x15F59F3F274C2AAC56093C1B42B2B99A
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x8A5760D459011C00EC9C64AA219FD461
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xAE19F5B37AA4690D2F24426A31A91EDF
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xDB90648C1A4A8D5E3827926001481212

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xE83341CC7F2600CD20D902E628DBC59B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x25BF2A26106C8D8FA8AF8B900CE492D4
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0x2ADDC70FDF5ECBA70B3D82FD4DFE012C
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0xFE288B0B81DC2F8EF3F59522BF3E0828
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x0D5EAE296C9425CE335C67FE38108C16
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0xDCD7B4AB415A446721422787562E9F2A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0xB41ADB4C18D3993F7C29C787246542CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x20494C3A5D6B4F6B75F232D94B8C6785
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0xD931F8A8B47446C62B74F0BED53463A5
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xBC007358D3F8D202FB435938FC9B796F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x0651E2A604358FD3D7085DDA6D65C851
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x4000262F48FB221402502C99A10E8434
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x4A4721445CABEEA3EAA4176BC9DCCFC5
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x7D626BC2B80791E7FF15CBF1C08C24A7
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x7807D8FD1674AFFE85AE00C7FE1A7395
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0xE8E7BE74CB60173AF0B32B33D59E2E79
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x58D90799E13378FD5C0F5E801D24BF3A
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x6DF6CD956F61E24FA0CCB21B3C5738BF
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0xB7980AAED1E176FBA6526F67625B62DC
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0xAB7C7B704387F47A76A2F77AEBB3C7EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0xE51DECE2DC653FFCCFAD6A41B3219E64
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
0x9752B0ADA7AF2DCBE4A9B96E689B21B8
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x9A332F5F1DEC4E59A28D2C18A1E77FE1
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
0xBC2C1F22E7F298D91678338EC6DCC1DB
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
0x61A84BF3140F365C3B5C774F593B46A1
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the

"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x7E23CC3D77C73D3743C868A1D31BD82D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x50732614E504D69295445051C69720D3
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x06EED7BFC507A8F03E67496DAF55E0C6
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x16267F4D4DD1E555119F32D5F1B34185
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x0D3B6947DC55D2760E44292CF1E34E69
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x575C0C7528CBADB188330A23E38E18C4
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x5AA11796F556662F4794F9DC01A7226C
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0x0274930073C3B95682522DB6AC33ADC9
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0x83093DECBD42DBEE27F278C35310D985
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x1D28211E4F9810CE0F404F40967A6793
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x3EF525E2761DCF1215B38E8011FBB08F
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x2A6E454069971F2CAF1DB3F167901B8E
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x827DFE5244736F095506E8A1A57B641B
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x5AB0C1D923C3B872FBF59D311709931A
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x94E2817C767A3185FF9260EB6DF40CA1
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x291BBCDECBB857C2F43082544672A5ED
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0x6F01214F0613D190935AD557F218DF1D
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0x11BD55E668EEC323F6B37FADF8CAF2AF
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0xCD6047BD370834154131ECAE4F176F8F
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0x50738846319E5713C01CBC20AE60ED14
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x5D94E6E3A9748DCA5398DEF5F20329E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x1F12256BB552251B5E21D3A8011DFBD0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x80B8B0B19C8308461877BBD2BD69C53D
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0xF42FF3CD84021E22E0A7F0C9C97AB524
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x39FE9D4C79A86435FE8B510203741712
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0x6A87065556DEB687A972A903BD81D795
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0xEFDA11F52F0315BF5A14BC09BA0C6129
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x5E6ACAFBF000ED477FDD0FB98B9A1BEF
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0xC3E668EA6BE230902F9644BEE3B881A3
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x5119E5AFFD5E3FADA108F5FBB4ED5B3B
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0xC7BCF89C4B9A51F65DA3C0609F076994
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0xA470DD9DC41590A29D35F32BA24A3A0B
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x68E046A25B98C4F880B815095F18CB12
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0xA24F55A88AF86BB299482937ECAA1A63
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xD5169A093DDEEBA2599ACB99666A1013
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0xD9ADE03FFC03B143D777D3825E15EE1D
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0x2E9D3D25BF91C1EB427F90343E0DD1FE
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x9CA9940D8B77ECFE2617716DBE203B0D
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x7808937AE74138BD4AAB08658140BABC
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xFBE931266B12C114AEF37841872613C0
forthwith be furnished me.
0xC22B60CF8B218F0A3B300A2BFB82C161

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x18C9FAEBC47648B41C2F0C0C3F4F0765
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x214C6D729748BC1F372AF1B71355C022
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0xA06195C5F504C5CCC3292BE5462D7D22
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x67C435365BD7014116D325B012CFB6F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xC7A469BCE49BC249BF8A15689C05C2E0
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x1442B97327AEED62CB24863FF288E718
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x47500170BBA75EA65889B8D4410BD6FC
years ago from Gateshead.
0x3B230C6493E7E01C9B20582F13F29B74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x6CF0193852630F528DCED40E0BC5B0A1
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xC73F49C51F6A3FE7EC6CE31F82191C48
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x97E1ABBA05C52B8FC69DCFC36426E02E
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x3FB3087331BCF01453D7841DCB0C30B3
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0x7AF0BC37A21BA9B50B1C0CC6BF2041F5
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x6BDE47FB5C6B26D2F57201FBC70C4D23
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x28DE52D0683A0F0266CB8590AF921CDE
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xE4008C9E617F4ACF05843710F7AF0AE3
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x37C4C69D31F9288531EE7A12C30ACD4C
while the change was being accomplished.
0xBB71CAC16EBD703C70FFF76222866993

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0xFBA1E85D9C7157015F229D0CC0901CB7
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0xF3A0B00E159E5512BE71BEEDCF54A607

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xAC3A085411CA0D0758C0082056CD18BD
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x6EE1BD78CC79119CA95D072CC3191040
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x9FAFFDEB6AF793E3B289668E491E961B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x8E168941A71003199FE67FB148B357B3
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x2E757A5784AF0045252AA03F8815A322

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0xEAC751424C04B6BD41BA811A0A899520
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0xB9A1CE23512C607A445CA8DF6AD1B1A0
complexion.
0x6047334F50F776A74BEF7A531D0DE808

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x3A49B051C7C9BA21C980BAFBD2B7E02D
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x621B632CB3C40955BB1CC760DB0E70D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x3B11587AF82B153AA5A5F2654F7E2D41
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0xDC95109FA73A08FE80039D260286E955
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x858857E107DFF5B44BCB50BF96A12CD7
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0xCA6A2A02CD6282EA53D54A2DF61598F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0xF6A1053B68AB2B31478C66526D97A5D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0xB85265B03BC42B6854ADD20A88F000E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0xE01D212E6C991D1AA96326A2311DFA95
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x4401E3D645F71614DC111C81BF361F35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x7B78E394B3DAA20C41454998675CCDA8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0xB086BCA036EE11972049D97D4E1264D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0xED88D48888495861A4F5D6E45A8D4F04
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x1911636E53A9649F2BEE78BC60305961
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x02B354E1DC6B8C9C667D1A3A6E4AC132

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x782EAC1C5BC2E664509A9E103F01EF00
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x0C0060AC08726E8790461D0A0ABF070A
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0x0C54FD1D80A45BDDA5D4A693AE6EFE1B
would make two of you in breadth."
0x072946759C90BF1229ECF6483F8EE880

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0x0FCBFF588B7595B611FCBC9FC09AC177

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0xFF622D0B4D899EA8AAA7BE87321E251E
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xF7E711C0AEE4E47E86CC9CD9011B776F
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xFE82260ED1416078DD5980C69337EB82
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x22F2DFA1E43CAE8ADDA18AA829B37A4C
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0xA8B85496736D438FFF6C5CAEA8B823DD
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xA6AB8E9F519C5F825BB636E59CF10BC2
quarrelling--"
0xCB62419691AA9CBCDC844D8C3794515B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0xCBD4D34162E0FDA3842969BBCCAAA794

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xF9949E400CAFF507C4235E9FE968A6BA
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0xAC734CD9314A38A7ECC9F1303DE1CF2A
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0xF57B1392C17DBC841A285DCE196929D3
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xFC39D3B7C521870CB91CAE496DEEEFE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What does he look like?"
0xB1A20C0714553E3D7B0007CBAA660C1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0xAA6F6BCB4CFAF67314F807177CF6756E
has such thick lips."
0x455516F46B59C85108B6536A48A39CFD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0xFEDCDAA93323F8B40B0E4545D9A693BA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0xE7CB1D18444B9AA572FF8C71BF4B145B
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x7FE60D5A21433A604A6D6EB89084AEC9
a deal of money."
0x59C563946C714DAFB696CF0A39979F9E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x07D9D909199C83633FA74A72D1829B73

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x4F54A3FB5284E699444AA079FFDEFA47
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x46AD6E5899D0B72DA39F5C0C798FE349
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x6EEFC3DFF4411A276854B8E8EDE5BBDD
you were quite out of my reach."
0x2E9CAC194230600555EF7477CF30C3A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0xC49807084E5D8EB0E013031748529F5E
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0x83B16AB543C90E3D50F0773153B51F30
shape denote admiration.
0x3AB06241DD004287D3F0165B11E0F57E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x219BE52EDD9BD17B5562ED093AD6703D
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x05A2A1FA4E9C02CBFCF9779C73F84A2B
a child."
0x8DD1F8FC5B93F5EB7E34AF93C37D2A26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0xBAFCE3D83358EECBF9508C5F515D26E8
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x998C89D6DCB59B6016385B332F6E04FB
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x3385C86454DEF5B4789F51DDC27B07EC
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x15A1213BEB4F52B9AF29AD97CF7AE8D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0xF9AD7E2A450809852F0B213E3D30759D
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x04F979EA6ECAD3F8DDA61EAB95C184F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A little."
0xC208B8208ACF2AB39F0DDD7D146308B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0x1D0C2F2C50D9CD61E97B2AEEE724EBFE
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x5E5930CF0172444E193A64AFCE8F0319
charmed.
0x28D2E7544DA4042AEFE3ED2A20AA4149

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0xEDFBDD9D88056C42A167436CA32F9CC2
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0xF4415037358522BD5CD45C56F42B77D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xBD2E0E293C956327AA5763B4B44D0B72
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x0E095F99725843819DE63E149D5667EF
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0xCC375C98E8BFBE538E0B59CB5635218E
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xBC360BA63421BF8AB8134FB6390B9A11

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x79CDA2AA35D5B5AF0963ACECAB756E7D
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0xE91E4A86F527EE97A83C9B6A210223BE
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x9DC28C78EB3B1C83FB28F14A66DBD9BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x5DE36EA2115D05B83D2E3E5B3A185FEE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x3345A8E1D93CE28646C24BAE45C78805

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I can."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xA0369D0464FE8D7372C69A9162B96D05
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x5786E81104C08163F2BAB3152BB12086
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0xC58B8DC75AD1F2B55C9A9BE36909B0BB
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0xC6029B14898965E9B636544DAF41227F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never in my life."
0xFE495C494CD9F6F16A353BC79C2559B1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x9D27F191E6100AACB6B35FB7CFABE2FB
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0xE6ABD90F2810C7CEC6A2C32DBEDA7280
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0xFA604CB31A4855CBBCF16D73AF1E38D0
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0x2D573B44CBC58B4F19A402DFA622151A
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x57CF6EEFD7260E4AB89CB52A3F5FA3C5
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x01482C9C3B635284AB861AD2D08C8BBD
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x82C6B238DF2F4E4E9A10C87D6A515C78
father's brother."
0x2DFE4031FC03A889D739E38DEB6CE3B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x3DB2F22059A92EC4ED06CCE5077F23F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x92D2B4671A463A714E85EC2E228E173F
tell me--"
0x637C8797BA4F9416F015B2B45CF51C86

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xDFB27223686998CB0EBBB4C3805E00A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0x54B9D7A2C37C10B93A3046EEEEB3F1D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"So he went?"
0x0F47704D8B64B7F46C5DE698BA5D3CDF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x59A9C3906E669D54E030C2F294F9D5C0
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x1123C0A45357FCD98E4111B8869CE3E6
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xDD3E6BCD7D6959CFFF89371177ABBED6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x3674E1571ADC3830628868159410C154
wine-merchant."
0x114DD0CD6CA0D69E6F77CF598AF0A1D1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0xC7CE702F2EFF42DA5E5FFC0DE1649426
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0x1C87E26A585647EB3BA830A81DA2E4CC
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x0608EF6DD15ADA1338A17730EAC5F5D9
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0x514AEAD87A72C3AB1C64B6C29BA646B0
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0xE0FA226C8EE5AB0EB7F4FF6A33CA1982
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x4869404DF35277E009DB7F5B6995B097
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XI
0x70B6937002AD5E5A3547FA9DA9A24076

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x564E00706BE44316F6D61141C66E8C26
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x322A5F1D7A6673A91790E3B9DEF039AD
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x38CF9095980365926E2DE773F45D902C
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x459192109F3FF6BD1114B7B15878C8C8
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x3E42342DEA05054D4E05CA910658CC4D
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0xB304BD61881F7318273E4B9B67B646E5
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x1E9332B6B66F7DB95FE0E57C89F7F20C
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0x011D3DFC70963F69863E93D963FCD15D
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0x64E252C7C3BCCBFBAC474F1DF657E8D1
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x4FFEB5FA13B5E6D9695F0752B44FC00D
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0x5BA5F5A2B3829B29B1663DA7D6C5C37A
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x62ED3C895F60B3BA2CD9D47E34363B80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xF27C0BB5D9E1BF702A1F584B122DEA2D
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x78373DFD612445FAF02AB0BD846B6B26
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0xA24BC7E3ACE585F48AC4949B0C6E972E
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x5C5F7C997D3705E68F424FC65890D69E
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x23408EA1CA5867694A1088347610262B
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0xBCD23DEE030C4F390DAC603320CB3B51
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xD21BB5D5EA3BE540D46ECE0AECA0D550
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x3C56684C31D6F0751CA3D6FE2C075A55
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x7390E97D511DF40E5163699FE7382E7A
troubling my thoughts.
0xD3660E5ACF1CF044AB090D5F6070A569

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x5DDE3C2B7E1D93178BEF5A56A7AC3A7E
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x09A5E0C0779C6832EEBDE6C18F0759B2
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x3605FBCBC6A8E8C1F5817FA49286EC52
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0xEF1F20A9F854E2EF82F820F44546B9FA
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x187BB3BCAABF5A9AE0FF8FB861B600E0
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x917A9EEC1ADDEEDDA783545ACC20F401
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x65806D235E32D6FFDA3C78EC7F7E056F
the bell.
0x56C6A0F0D2601FFE6DB4936CE7873D64

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x0BD11F4F88D8BD106C41C8AFA42F759F
the waiter who answered the summons.
0xD522FE2215A34E4F2407DCAD45845341

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x34BF06F7A10B2D1AFC6FD8B7C98F2EEF
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x74D909EFB0F613A144BDE2C95F0D9E07

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0xB93E49E384DFAB7122ACF3173C6542B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Person here waiting for you."
0xA618DC2EEAD005D925EF828BE6BE1AF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0xB873FA4D47325CCC1855973803A4F57D
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0xC8C374C6BB4823F0373ECFC478856129
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x34A7DFF5B032A31B3F67A85B789182EB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x12C4EACF5BE4E2FE5DBC911201B21D2D
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0xB302AAE7E38BCB56DA96C3F00F1D7525

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x913D024768FAF802512FA4ADBA3EB948
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0x2CAF2A31D15AB9BCBFFA40128B7BD0D4
Thornfield.
0x3260BC2892F0CA88A3327785EA8B3C7A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A matter of six miles."
0x7AB507807F26E33A0F4E2E848452FB61

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x50FF89888704E3C37410B8FAFCC9DB7E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x4B25EE2E498A35EBD57C5CF46994100E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x734F82980D8CA2AB801AC5BEB594D99D
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0xCB6C58FBDF043ADE8A58BC5F208213A4
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x81D04DE12FCD2E6AA53342D0F1D92313
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0xE6257DE86AFE29AE0B06D89997EBDD16
much at my ease.
0x816B456F9805D187B3E5912B6DF204FC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x626AD5B5277434D82F25B49F23D53565
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0x2E357A608758D506D9AD0818BFF10800
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x15FF0A035FEF2648B63D954E0EE85071
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x8F50A2A77FACD37254232F4132C6E660
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0x357E6229B5FA2C22D8516869BDF2C505
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xA0C9645FA920B8CB505FE9F6AE4998A9
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x58028EF244B4BBED3E559B75EA6FE20D
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0xA2994C7D7254A12A6B2F269518C9D41B
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0xE6528C79C98AA90B02AA008985B2D3D6
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x87DA7FDA94FB3929D1373E0DEEA5CF33
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x1512C56A8CDA84A1C2A01A89AE67D1F3
road now, I wonder?"
0xB7595EC220FC1EFF528E22D5C0CE4AE5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x400058C60C51F8B5018D96A90D13999E
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x7F2499E30133A731847079416F1F65EE
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xDAA75C0EAF3BD7F0C2BD08E7F45DB7C2
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x3CF0BD0EE07E21627C3B6F582D842640
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x0391434779AA73271CA437D7424CAB3C
more stirring, less romantic.
0xD3B5E5F48D242D0EAFCA22A6C595AC74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x1376A3FE3982CD8E21A659250B7A0EAD
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0xFD0B30D7A889E9B2B975449E6B4587C8
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x31FC7E8DBA0F344C6F60E95CC8A8E90D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0xE05A06578260EC25EF69F75D7281B541
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0xD03FD270F0931366B45D21C17FAF240F
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0xA67C7BCC3C0BC0110C11762F78827B75
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x9F44765B88699A007B42F56152FE4D65
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x129F6594D8B7CE1CFC63429CD414D4CE
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x3863523904D49608086444CCE598DCF1
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x67ADA629AC4916A1C78EEEA1627D324A
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x4CD9CFAA81B7D96DFA108DDA28AC4A44

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x5362132CAA482BAD2375A9BFBFB36B5F
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x23DEDD71EEBE1FC74D1D8AFDA914C6FD
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x31B7669D1123B83C60EFF9174910041E
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x6B6C6318975C9AA9AB420616000E413B
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0xCBB1C4282FBA2F82AA0038DA35E536DB
itself to my view.
0x26149465E2910D0C4691C1B78EDBAB75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x8108ECD0ACF84F21382E44D79AA0BB4C
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0xDDCF40410FA22FA15066E8746C873D0F
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x4589FC459C1AB51E5935F639BC082191
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0xCEEC9659A6DA07B949386EB632CB3326
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x6E4F9283591C6129B843C85863C1327F
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x6C3D52B703CBAC28E7B9387BB1C14C79
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x9CF338F33B5C9BB80CDE87D134396CB3
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xE295BBBBCCA368F5E68F8A6F16B71655
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x138DDA030E211B44C0111E1567F31F37
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x62684D0E8C1A1F8A68B4C660E5BEAD11

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0x9398566315DA2F671E68F43D61F0430F
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x3A0C973194DDC301633F8EE9AB49E3AF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x5B771E155E118CFB69D7ECCACA0921C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xA04B20385FC724B11777B8B9F480D1BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xF707927BCF68D61FCA6B569DBE70CBF0
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x00F5F3E8E272D84D50F24C73B486D91E
trouble.
0xADF177E69468750A32EB95D6D8C71D1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x764F62645E41133C4745F8ED3BE18966
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x2763D0BC1E5F9621505B8D93D3A1458C
the keys of the storeroom."
0x14E8C81EC58607B535E330F5C3B5058E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x830DF047BBAA9E11ED90685C1C33F3B1
delivered them to the servant.
0xCD1A79B065FB4A7164F6AD365AB01536

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x77ABC846BB7895AD8782D772DAF80D57
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x81C42DB3176F23645BDE8B95D11F6F8D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, ma'am."
0x33DE906F0EC43E69FEC2BAF2E9AF1E04

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x79936725B9BB9F0AAEB4DF09AD90D541

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xC7602470BDBF3ADD51C570DC55257B2F
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0xD9373C6B80406BD77B7009D9D569C6C8
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x28854F5CBDD7EEBF4F7D9B377EB9A001
too soon."
0xD941F589C111F7417D02EB8A2FB05008

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0xF9869D324FCE3703D9E033C732FAA046
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0xC6052E718413605C0181823F632004B4
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x5DF0E917C99759D702E4E33BAA5809F3
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0x37983A4738C40A0E4751201297472782
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x7AAED761D749E8DEF61AC1B7BF5F3277
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0xD5B05996B9C8FD16454DA12F70D2344D
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0x053FBA6D3F171C87CB88E78130100181

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x5AC8E9AE1D42FF0B09038D33E12895D7
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x452BFF07ABAD2F572DC872645A32543D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0x6667F4321ACE7DCB24A684F372C5D898
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0xCE716D63105A1D1B592244962ADA9E7D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0xEE709D11932982FE2EBEDD1218909769

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xA89399A4CE79022339C1BE033ED28F5B
future pupil."
0xBC9310F94F98C90A7C34ADBF2E4190B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0x4624A0F483F6D863A739E99228578C93

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No,--I have no family."
0xC7AA5985B112BA58F5610326A2808C62

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x9BEDC05E237948F4D75EA818DF2D2FDE
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0xA1B4D689151BBB673735CFCFC18D37CE
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0xABCE166F7DCD0D2F61FE56C4DA5152D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0x452580061EEFB5A9D1ABD6736C439B56
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xE911431CF702152B643AB69CA090F109
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x405C5B7697DC9213669AFB83FCC49991
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x1AA9C1003FFD9587EFD00E3C36383DD7
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0xF7CDEAEE983F8918B0326B889A0598CE
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x033B6FB6C04623BF95FCC105BE2E7FE6
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0x59848BB6DAB142D9E84D580FE1CBA2AF
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xE17428809055B814F87AC676CA1D8589
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xE5D4EAE84EDAFE4C5500B4107AF18D01
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0xDC76649127CFADFD73D508EEDC4B05F8
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0xF5CCAEF530832EB154741F659E7AC75C
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x7B368CFAA5C7B5E3E6A4660E155B0CD4
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0x9F150D5BF0FB435629DA2E0202E392B9
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x6A09D5C50A517B1BBABFE75C03023603
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x3ED689EEACCAAB2E3A1ECDCA3FCE28C3
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x29A0D701512CB1B5A905541A5F3301FF
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x9506404803AFF289B874FCD544BD5DCD
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x1027EFC838E5D190584F4FF2E0BB4BEF
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xC1C5FB0B026A9021B4A798CCC4D0B560

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0xC1672FFDFDFEDB635F417C2D09F93C6D
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x00DCC99AB4F856E99D065748BC6C6FFE
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0x9F252EF16506411B9D758BAA7B0E41F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x749BB6C1F51C61679F67FB9AFA14D8AB
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xEE19A0E5B3E596EF0E254FC3A1D65F89
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0x91F6A2F8D7C483A1F34A1E64E3EFF220
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0xC3063F4469FD7C54529671CA2FCD5425
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x64D1E9904B1E67F347ED7D85D5805248
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0x7E312596FA99895754B50A221A86AE5D
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xC2FE936E8924F6CEFBC038E51B96CE14

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x1CE544B5B73575431787867C16703285
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x5D67B9C48B0ED5E007971E003796E3CB
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0xF3ACD6531C06D6BD899184239E0E9F91
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0x17B000E9AA2C0B732D909DC09C920954
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x8D4F6A183B85577F02EF8970B960CAF5
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xD588C2C7E34B09142D198B94A665C06E
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0xF3DE4FC26DE715AE6518FD143DC205F5
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x3B1A7DCD6258EE4C1123B9D73213E876
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x23584786410526C980939CDE94D4744A
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xBA21FF5D9C224DA7CE6575F201C49189
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0xC5E4FC6ACEA1EB014734453D4621E76C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x444B9D8F6FA0FF6B49B015D41382797D
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x716C00063E1311FE2DB3535F31E45263
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0x47C6194B5398A029A17CD0866C69526D
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x5C2BB5B521424B5EBE277B4FCE20EAE5
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xB4555A51F545784BDDDAD4AD373A4BE1
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0x793070FEE1DA66E76136083F3E66FCFA
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0xE2515F71088B4539C17198F713880309
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x654798144D55B288BA8D3BB70BAEBACF
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x2FA1E6D2F457DD7660FEC3ECD57587EF
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xCE0CFACE1377A1E55B6021C44E0B4F80
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0xA9218660D3AA257F203336A6FBF30044
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0xB38D5303374D2519E17765FE7CDB2D0A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0xA6CD6CD302329D7282823B165B7AAB01
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0xDB0ED4316ECBF8AF2710A65862FBCF30
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x5A7BB8B5ED18D46539738230F7021BBE
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xC749DC2475DDF4551F3FDCAF2CB95CB6
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0x324197370E3E08F51FD5DC25B637F249
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xA1DE75A3F19E06E40633C5C43E58C16D
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x67F1F1C4B4E448E6F8C46F8BF1F43F1F
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xA328C52023F687F3B66574DFDEEFF3CE
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x744673D5E9133B92AAA1B11E58405E1F
an indefinite future period.
0x4CAA9F3B9460B7AAAABCE484DD959942

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x84F6D1D4C0F341B814833171C4491425
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xDA067E3E112242F2707BA22B999EA2D3
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xA5C28A72F5FFCCE59C11EC043643EB5E
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0xD8C5321F158EA45BF6282A7F5C972E2C
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x9D9AC0BB209F106D4664D39757BB6E38
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x84E7E0D228244562EABEAFD319B286FD
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xE9636981DC01BD50D1C3F91322918808
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x0D740FD0847576867E64BAACBC4BAEB3
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x4761D1AEC9893541F7D1D74A999E92F2
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0x98E4EF0F6B77389B8EBA711E5EBE478D
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0xD61DF85C6BE78EDB4B051B91F70CCA0C
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x00CCBB32E95B39FE06C2CDA020356FF5
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0xA3319115DE3FA4BAA99E3C63D4FD7A02
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x2D041B08F25BA95F3B5061F8928F9BBC
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xBF8B285511D396FFB870DF1E870ACFEA
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x50523D8F505E80E2B20F7CD5D8C5C74A
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xF515C7BFA93D488EF8822C964C4E6617
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x4BCDF9555794B8D13C68ABF04326BEB5
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x2181129AB28DDDDA6B06892E3627BF34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xF7461DD03E2E68C665A6C16BACC38EF4
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x46458F9FFA60B75589720DE848B70582
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x705C61D27DF3A2D75E222000F9FAB2BD
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x11344AB7AD7FC5C89FCABD2B3B5FF67D
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0x85FEC89D646F293EC3793517F444E1D0
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xB67669A67C8DB18D3C9C2A3DBE28304C
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x6B1C222462BE289089EFA4DE3164A705
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x9EF43AFF9E9668B94A4C029F280E514E
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0xE37200ED0CD502B913FB277BD9A3D30F
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0xA454552633D6311CED2F854D4FCE6444
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0xFD6401357268E71AA25C53CE7F5E3455
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x0516CD352930CEB83A46F7AB9FEC8C11
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x0D34A579960676FBF37BCB9E615B27F2
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x1618C974194F6FF2D325516D9D02298C
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x615B3FCD1C76574D0FB0D8C22D54B4EC
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x01B211C526F749D31A94B3423618FBA7
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x0CAF6EE92D7E47D074056AAF1F65A952
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x85D2C94962824FDFC89A80B3C7B6B9AC
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0x4387739D770D3650F023571C03AD720A
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x0E6F0A1295D3821754E5689B708231BB
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xC6C302D927867FBBF710D781E7F3765B
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0xEF0FF1129E86E09D08DE79A4CC3AF829
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xECDB66F59B064EE38A40DF9598C4BF7F
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x5C54E741E229A1503FA5324B3D63E821
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xAC6E634E38C420C240A7B02632E64A99
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0xC07F4B60C09BF2571E71DF8CCA284836
house and gates.
0x6F50D6D54B79C0E77FBF58E8D69E8AA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0xC7C06D2BED1808A7649D0D7AB3002C1D
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0xC6EC2F3EFB812B63E163A19C18A0BB76
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0xDF15A5CE34CD6A3EB9FBFFFFA154158F
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xF60A30A25C8B5EC3F64C2A162FA391F3
appeared at the door.
0x27E94F87E2CFE266AB13E6E40AD95E84

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x6FB813BE7AD74637263EEAC8C46B599B
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x06AD9AD2637D2F05BEEA5BA4AEF1938F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x6624154BC7FB1151796521176C44C5AB
much.
0xDDD6BE7CB7446C9E960B83CFD74A3C20

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x14C352E8C3E0D487DBF83480147ED2BF
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0xB21C43C4448B6663EB5A9A582561F507
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x412BCFB346F799038F4355B9CABE9DBB
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x08432EA4D414264E85FA39121ED78358

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0xB06C8243B724CCC0FC06F75CC5C83500

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x6D501EF49141807301E522241F134481
was called Rochester?"
0x1533973BE6E7B864A2B79CECDA1C8C0A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xC7D887D6174FE332A2C32E17E1014DEB
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x53FB8F5F129D8EF91E96F50FCB1B8CC9
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0xDDBEC0BED002A1BF97FCF9950E73498C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0xF5B470A8518D4BF3DDB4F9474B1007C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x49CDF64CD08AE2DEF8BD662CB9110E16
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0x933D46656C99C9A0F05BD9CCCA5C79E3
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x1E741D82263D467975B885A5B9C24B08
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x4A38E68029CCED3014DFFA70B9FE2C6F
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0xA739763D3BF7C72080D0C536322A53B8
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x7FE49AA0E2B7ABFF1F53CE9B083851BF
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x60E2A186B151A5762055E812CB8CF445
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xE9755C5828060162B0653204FB0CFE96
expect nothing more."
0x7CE1D035B68A7C82512BAF219C30FE92

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x8E03191D10B5F970B7F00F628709DA54

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x7059E809FC6C85EB215A28921ACAA093
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0xBF4D90314613586C668E085257E74CEB
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x1ED550D8DBF73D85461A50611B453035
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x90EA9552AEA1C37D8A893DD7E185D0F3
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0x09FC0B9D1F803A36990E8F00A16426FC
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0x2ECE67FCB606B2719DB44DD02F065627
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0xF6AEBF14638FF4A8CFCA62E09E2ACC65
the better--my position was all the freer.
0xB9FA987DD6EBC9A5A20FECE9249C3F94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x534435D37FF15817A7DDBB1BCCCABE67
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x09E89759DD7CBDCB7A4314DB08FB6A7C
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x0BDC2A2E8D7111510D166E05CD084403
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0xA27E9F8C4ABF6C7489A2FE8B1FA8470C
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x84616CD0D18BBF6DAE2C4500C39E1068

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0xDFE53B1D591EDC261BF038E09427E7A1
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0xD27FA321D68626951C850C295FF5091A
approached.
0x64B1E2CBEF4B436F350384AC16CA5A46

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x1FD661086EE0358B39FBF8B2BFD2783B
nurse; who answered--
0xA1B61B0AF223C033921E573004485F2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mais oui, certainement."
0xDF789D5AC19261CFB42CB0D936CD7FAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0x52AFDF2A9B1211B7AA87723402B94FC0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x0DACA98BE67461D9FFAFC0872B833CA2
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0x174FF41AE0D66623B7A76224ECDBCAF2
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0xBC338D221FFC47BBE7ADA96BB2CBBC7D
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x14D06BCCEED6BFBC596C2BDB9BFFC428
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x02FF61549DF89BB939795D83F7DC974A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0xA6F64B1289E7A44B71F788C6E25328F6
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x18E120CD47FC475A41028796673829C7
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x281BC4684F205C19EF5B9659ED4ED88D
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x57913DF2AE54D446C98B680779D17C1F
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x6BA10275E4DBC587BF46ECF1B9A6EECD
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x91507971D04E01A642D005CC8ACBE290
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0xAE2466820BCC9640B0DBC1C86DD35FE1
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x6B1AA0B923696CED24180B0ECB0309B6
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x7C90E56FCACF0A8A08F4DB8A13E6D0E6
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x999F7F9CD205143A21A48F35ABE40983
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x102B5BEE4A7C756F096A104634DCFA01
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x3ED3DCBEFD88B86823B60F1E2F66A359

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x1AF8EAD642D1FCBD7DE64BD9114A1A1C
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0xDD21836E0AC4A96E3DEAA47F6F505FB4
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0xB9C8E3FC638300B2F144E05917E8AE1B
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0xCE868AA12FD247BD522473421E9F50BC
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x7671F06588D8FAE49966D56149145609
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0xE12274D15443289739507E1D05D602E6
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x6F7E96C870EA0BADED0A67AE669E79CD
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0xF185FC7C01F286EF49194C75B48F858E
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x6E646617277FB39C2C8A600A362C8AC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x03A364FCF731EBEC98642DCBCE1AF173

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x96CC72EDD14FC19C7BC782E9434CF991
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x1BCE62BCD82962782BC292A573A0DF0F
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xC5E0BFEC2197990F57018EF8FADA8B50
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x7208CC5C130E9F780BFAE2D3858FEE6A
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x35977A614636014F7C4B202BC2905469
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0x8759BFD6DA82A9C2D4643B41952046AD
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0xE1A13E59ED06BEB9FA537A2C8F5ED8F8
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x73654A021D73F075A43CF988754A8724
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x26252E74BB534ADF6843B19E99C2CB80
fed with crumbs."
0x1B5C61F88F811BFC540C10A1EB69FBCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x6E896C7BC6865B7DC2C459158D9B6DA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x158803C37DA04EFEFBA392623A28A763
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x05E76DD9F11C515ACD0D9DDFE11B9E50

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x1A96E56441ABFBD1E918E4E8FBFA5F8B
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x6192B3ED13300524EA4D89BA23572CAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0xB8092DD64DDA4A1CE1B971114205579F
clean town you spoke of?"
0x2C65A81AE037CD8402A3DC9E31E601A2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xB5281ACF00D8E1D20E5A5C63F42DABF9
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x3732C0E946D8AFA5D0C065A5ACD5DC3A
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x4D26B4CD1711E38E41335CBABD60FFDB
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xC84730BF23E48A3C967E3AE430753420
hear me sing now?"
0xFC447747CE6A73858F8D555FFDE73B3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x5831978D343F772D1162F5400F907D32
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0xD910B0558FDCECA72972B557FC7732EF
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0xCFF4EE6F0ED9F0192D243BC658DC50DB
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0xC5559794A71DA8268FA3BAC03264E9FE
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0xCDB88111B7AC36371D9518854187D591
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0xC4A9AD2401DF9FF263B05A528A1CEAF1
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x5F9E9102D565CB1893EEAC35CDDD0CA5
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x5360C72A95FE624D0F238A3576922931
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0xF499922643E5D698A70066F13D16904A
affected her.
0xB104739BB4FD7DCA7FC833A18B380FC6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x227453C3708DEC96485CBE71645867DD
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x0169C70447FBD38D9E24FA360836A041
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x0EBF50326DA5AE53C7307C3324EDBD6F
at least I thought so.
0xFB8B91F115AD8DBCC9E7F5CA447848C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0xFA0478F5CD872AA507B4A5071467131D
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0xA259DF07CDE9D88499F3B5B6A4AA20F9
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0xC1E32E1BA49BB80320E755EBCB00B86F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xF7B18D4F540A1E4BAB96C5EA41645270
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x192AF987A428745020175DF563D8BC29
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x95D8C55E53FDB179CE6B41B38FE2D052
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x51F1A3DAEF90AC3DF55768DAF0423ADB
carefully trained.
0xED557806A1A12E1488E3A4BA034D4629

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x46126CCA8EFEC34FF311985D354C8FD5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x0A8A89FB9BC53D16EB33184ADEEE4D62
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x6939E5BA047290B47EF39382CDAA8088
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0x8DB52EF0E7E778FF0865379F0632F098

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0xEC11F8C90EC98BE15792108C80050953
say, with whom did you live then?"
0x3B3C29597FC644C2DFB27464FC0DD070

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0x0F3ADC61896BF4E6B844FB6D6B9E635D
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x3EE439162CC531C7C2B7DDD265C588EF
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0xBD9F0CD7891C544832764291BD6E74A8
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x566FA3D626647D3A3F651299209288A5
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0xC1C78A8176CAC07661AA97B727A06F27
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x732ADF72259687F8C29C68833B58CA13
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x73301D7F127198B81988D9B03DB600DD
and I never see him."
0xC749786DA5AE0439D0458ADB647E0E80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xAF2CBA9FC73608269D24F5408437DD31
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x8CEE99795E50B39D8E575F8ED7D753EC
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x95F1D0E823B1B79BE677C7D7F9174C37
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x851A2E52893550AC5088805F517CCC63
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xAD93E8AA30E843B58F1D72E0D61FEE4F
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x2A6BF45BD1D041A6635EBEFAFEDFF725
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x731A7DFF7DA927072638743A596466AF
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x9740646C9C5C65EDCCE5D09665DC05F0
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x7E65A12CA70915441D82902B9AB3324C
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x7D7729C735DA0A84DF0EB49A6E737B11
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x42D62651E9C33CF6F152148E32BE92FB
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x0193AE06856927D30DFA69CB5B9150D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0xAE29E0B3A3982A46B1F6A1F5B5A21CA9
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0xF6BFA603471B8F341BAFC0C47A64224E
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x6A54F1F72995823BDDFF47D3067EEC4F
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x3F13D99EE183DC65E350A845C450E4A6
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x56ED88B1EE86345B874AADB39A984701
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x2AA0A670233FF06AA777A4677E711B96
use.
0xEDD0AD83DFAAB89E4797539A14CA41B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0xB99ED1A856F05C7F3AA45E089A53EA79
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xA8E48666CD085BBBE9F8D8C263FD84B0
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x4DFECA4E8E1171CE1381A394EE979327
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0xBE37EA7B468E36EE23DD306D9D3E511E
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xCF5741775F1461170378412E1AD9F402
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x79BEE076AC96463CF230496A7D21776A
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x57D81D303AAE8F0BBEF970F527DFE7B7
sideboard.
0xDA4138D12AB77103AAA0D0825DBD7C4E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x1933474594ED7429A52EC7E8229FAEBE
before seen any half so imposing.
0x42496C9B35631C8C8DB21F35A27DA0B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x8CE371EC3018BD84498D5DD60F7F7DA2
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x3123D55174D1CF5FEF607EA98AF94CA1
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x11FC5D7A4540F14F2B593A195148AA8D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x85F163ED69E5978356D24B7574132A8F
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0xF97CBCDD7802B189C5FE67CCDA85FDFE
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x4E979E5529CD4F742A79C4AEEC461ABB
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0xB0083190937B1F74505E8A404228D858
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x475BC0E5F704E6BED6DEFD5E6C2EA488
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x046550E160FF881FA20FB248D2BD513C
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xDDCD1061762F0A196ED124A348961111
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xC2F521C06953E225D22D38A9A1021E6B
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x7BB51E981AFA3F8EF1F1295F7FE320CE
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x91262E6DFE4D000CDCD267B1DD178C2E
general blending of snow and fire.
0x7010A5B0E60F42A6B1CCE74F939F23A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x9C6BA2AB4888BAB5DABA470E77B0B633
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x30CDEE66F656B9BAC270A0B71A81E5D8
were inhabited daily."
0xB4D79DB663637F1DA3791C5591EE2891

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x8FEF3D8859E6622CC661134B61747F3C
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x39F1DB74BFB43A996E9AD544A6DEA318
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x5E366FCAB98B861BE03852E1987FBC82
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xC99CF361DC859190E232E694D6393076

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0xDBF7AF0BA92A899A3E805B0E156A2E84

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xEF5B8DBD7C17591970495214E6969E9A
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x8CE1FDBB923023591DBD07BFC22D68A5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x88484383010095023FDFD90DD7121B45

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x9324F1CDD22592385401487CC5E0D69D
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x4F9B49FCD98C0CCA8A28FCC9B497D6D3
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x1ED664EE2D184295B221660F6CA33F51

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xA2342C95904B98F939288026E7E82153
liked for himself?"
0x7A181FC2D233E21F1C4195D69A45F563

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x41CA360F02F500AB152C9E02C9472E37
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0xBC28FAAE0A1EC480FDB84950146F8454
lived much amongst them."
0xA5C00789AF9773A15251F7407F50006F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x8639884AAC6626351E1511D4A52F8058

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0xEA232E8374C34CA47FE1DDBA22E6F099
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x57020B87D94BED4D702EA06A60F198E2
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0xD2B6940524BCDB2F0C1CC151352A33DB
conversation with him."
0x3EF11FF372A21631D8EA008A219401DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x26AA347107E0975C1C8A2417CE010839

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xDA3539245614F403FA572FB2D5E174C2
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0xB0192E188CE5C3FBE12845DD5596C6A0
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x912C8DAB25E08DFFC04FFB8FEB67FD71
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0xB90657FDC85A3C497CD2D3BF06102971
he is a very good master."
0x519CBDD723A603C2ECA82589057E9BE3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x9ED5AFCB150A8A02DA71EDEE985102AC
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x54CC0E58A7DC68D77F75C806EB526BD1
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x920B5C24A5BFD324AFEE623A7DD1C4DD
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x1BE1ABD5A787DB6F2A2FF7EA1A8DD131
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x7278A8A6E83D52E6060E53771A5810E2
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0xE62C605567C56051A68D192EC8581D1C
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x320999EAA94F6CF36E86E66E2D87C5F5
definite notion of his identity.
0x0C8F15FA0ED0C757BDF247C1A8B809C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x79F45BFA7C4DFF9201B5566903771C1A
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0xA79EB215A9346183211DF7811C8A0810
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xEE7F89F7350DA3180A5405955AD3EAAC
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x08AF36B2D112815088BC93C342B7D93D
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x1183910AEDACAD9A7D7A99EE4EEA98EF
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x308AB34F7F4168C598EEA47B62854FE2
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x0871D422A69A32F57C843CDCDD36EC34
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x0663F1A10C36B7093526687EF62E9F1D
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x1BCDFFA21C1F7A541B839C778A75E4C1
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x77AD51CFC15FF6F529BFDA495D8CBE2D
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xA4A648C3024618A2652AFF8A26623FC0
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xCEB9059C2307C5E2EDDD1F4001D72763
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x9AA88DD25F237C653FCE589098783FF8
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x29DF1747A25B21855E82A2048B37C5BD
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xCF32CE6EA6B174518399E5547E733B92
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x1B880B2C10D7F66D76A8DB25A48098DB
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x69052A08C138EF9C270413674FF5DE26
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0xFE207498ABB1129889FBE58397C850D8
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x95B77C4A4366E1636003D5097CFD2A79
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x07B4DC74FBB905292F6D04A7C0B9C874
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x55DA23B77C9F9CE33589A23E3839134F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x3861FF303F3AAEC075EB2AAB93ED4BDC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x7A04C26E6E99A4FCBD49691F8CA22DB4
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x9956F2BF4CD0205CD49CB1BBE9269A4C
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x8936C978DD2962C680DED86E8EBEF26B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0xFA6162332035C9EACB1F47FBB4F3C5B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x7A312CD9CB87E456745A8C494747E718

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x8F62F32C01911EC19028FFB7E54FFC92

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xF08134325D777A529BC838C0592C671F
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0x86192C557F9FE45FAE1321AE1EE8E970
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0x886B3613088968162A8D3F0D5A9D1DD3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0xD9CEB5F058149355D2C8AE1859CC9267
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x10FEB49DA3F4620B0191E09B05F88066

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x84BB7DF9ADE9A9592CE8C99953FEF8EC
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x386C573B27012B8A21EFAB0518D96C3D
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x58ED697E17C969E36D216F748DCB7E16
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x3169E2566DA3EAEFFFABEE07F804E4DE
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x91D5A693BF1E32566EF66A3B38468DFC
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x41426EC5CDB141C6E38160A691B030B2
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x2B139BE1BA0132A1E0195F02456F1269
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x35D859162DD7514983BE87C091F65C52
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0x69B2A6033E0D457547FE1529CE451D1B
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x1EDD344CD3D01F8DD30457FED84F8DF5
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0xB9F9D767787A787B33CD87DCCC1F0A88
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x0F0CEEE94B7F05BABDE4B4C980ACFB3E
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x84A9513DA2E982E1FCD9C1A5AE84A873
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0xE4A93FC83604DF9B0AB4A66F3A6CE501
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x528E1F46E9983F5C6DDBBB47919BCE0C
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x4893C9DD7F7B38F256115400B11FCD11
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x653EDE75CE9DD40709B688D57C90000B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x03782FD36C396E9876A53DBF3C6F1F83
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x11BABBF85ABAF2EB38CA6B2CFF142F5F
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x2928305BA40AB0D76AF22EB010FB3FB8
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x0714F6BE6BCF71F7B2E9C15B5DFBAEC3
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x737FFA916960CE2AE3B1BD708BB63EAE
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x0855D359B0EF8C128461816357E35108
Bluebeard's castle.
0xE6397852DE4A260FB6A4E88EFBB6028A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0xA49DE6288689AB4422BBFEED5158CB43
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x9C1F869E10CCB4E9B50E3D2DE0D75541
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x5D22CAA78DA57B620CA5CA14F1F366BE
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0xDADB25F7C33D06E746FAAF98D44EEE9E
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x0CBDCCFADCB64AE3EEFA1BCD822E0A7F
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x4DCFBCCA1A182271AF1F1D71DD88AB76
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x061438F77B8648036DE81193AA33497F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x44672A213328E53F6EE67551897E5372
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x88B2F6054310F7C2BED9F272F6902809

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xA3A2ACC1B17F1C99997144DDD95104AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0x0E44ED4A1088F1365CAA74A78324D1B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0xBFC1C329D09B9BE29BC2088F6F2AEF8C
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x22B300F6300F522E5CEC872867C5ADBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x81B4EEEB999E912E682F55E0AA6BA27C
odd murmur.
0xD870990F459D7AC2E1BC88D89A875813

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0xE3E3F70B2DB32458AE8C132002A40B2C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x90743D8A7CF2754D41313E16DEE66725
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0xD0B881996443442F109D36121D7B4DDA
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x4FA14B4AB85EE7BB731EE6574BA1DCD3
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xDED5F62EE114DCE544469E632B7F82AE
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xF294B4017D624B6BDEF6A4473A8DE3B3
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x3B67CAFA2AB717221C8BC6BD2081FE6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xAA3D2D2386D4306A7A568AF6B78E0153
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x9619E18F2A78C0DFCAEDB28A9B06C178
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xBE0321BC773CA0015F10E70B57F91645
be conceived.
0x4C896493A43CADCDD3653B4C9B2F5173

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0x4017EDADD13D885BC901551CF9744666
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xA300567EDBE7CD6BDADB3AA529E464D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x23C5066A7C109E2F42BF77E5B3FBA42E
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0xBDC2097B4853E637C53F0AFCA928598C
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xB5B060185A55BB460A6A58EFB026AE93
pupil this morning?"
0x33FCD7EC35D0293DFA91346569FCAE7E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xC7B6ACE28ADE608CCC0AE0899792A803
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x1326D64E8F8CE20B4776D25389A128BE
hall, exclaiming--
0x94936DFF86EF0BAB00986EC4E2C1E081

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x1FED7DF90DCDC98651F6BCA6997CE0C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
0x18A8A66FF16CE4E6EA8CED6FB9ABD471

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x91959504E28971C6613471D8EF84BDED
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0xE110B1155FEE4C5FE2037B056A1A05C5
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x28361F592E6FA2DD036F64C287791433
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x68D83BF72BA599EAF0EEF023E365AFE1
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xD5EBD78BF95DB8F5B58C3D24DB82BB58
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xBDED72F99D30616BD9CE3ABA12840F2C
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x42CCA517CB46D4AA80A85DAD8A7652C7
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x14008E9DD598DF0D6336CBA4ED0DB033
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x0863B771ADADA6336F9E98D67AD33134
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x945AF3A59F5BA7173F829ED2D2B08C89
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0x7EAF22ADEEEF0137BE64D1DE93BA027C
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0xEBB68B461919B6B07FC9DA06F89A6BBB
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x203F425946E81E01EE347C0FD2793F2F
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x32D8768DD3EFCB635F7D3475CDEA9AC6
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x6DFC1CFEC8322C8268FDE67944EB4590
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x41CAB6BD34B5FAD81CD579FFFC5D4043

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0xF2FF97152732D90681BFF6CF5ED6B5EF
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x2799B90F39D6E7A62A09E5FEB94C2F69
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x40C36CFD8FB6C3794BC9B38BAC226790
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0xBE37E84EB59C2F3FE192E316929785EC
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xC1FAEC276418CE3EC7FDD08A9EE8CD9D
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0x4D3AC76EBA8DC722EA9489D6C19D841D
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0xDCE786F7B2DD5EBEAF96A367FB675D62
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x5DDFE5FA6C430A9D49A7692A482D012F
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x5AE305498D1045B2F3450C7AAD59899F
of her mind and character.
0x5C0239663CD28BBB69D1EB19D197ABA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0xE3354753048ACF66D7559FF53039799F
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0xFA768E39CD3D34A2D24C50E12CCFA907
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0xEAC10E2BD91C5AD1D36C04B6D857A0C3
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0xC39695A8DA58998EDFED54B1BC4ABF6B
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xB293EC2637C2759C5C7041BA586C764E
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0xD7EEA03914E1D8E8D12C7D376F3D54EB
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x44EFA3FB2B0A95F29F63173BB2C4897A
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x307928DD80371881F17C87877F230A51
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x789552B76D02551ACC8B539D41ECD6F2
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xF2F2A12CC1D5766A35B4E70EFB4CA3EE
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x0DF3E95BBA59BC5DF68DE25A7536CD15
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x738415FF6C1D10E77205DAB34969096B
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0xBE902B45094205D813FB5FFC9E97D591
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x74A37782F4DFF44039B05D24E35513CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x52D4C0B84E463896BB243417DD79AC0C
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x7B73ED4CD1502DEC6F481261DC808D61
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x155163A17BF7DE6AAC2190A01923A6B3
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0xE84A4B6897D3284F2CB853AC9F9DDDB2
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0xE73862132A390A6058B31857A043F714
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0xFB3E34E9B619C70B4311D8157E8D4032
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x9FC446BADDA9AE52E00F41A0D92FC1B2
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x7F3407D2C8D53CE25AEB3864D75C9F18
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x4DCB2071E73B7ADDF616F88F98921A5C
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0xB27844FA40023F3F68E7892EDB98C48B
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x580A64620CFD45E18EB6742CDF9A1910

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x03C369A21EAE6620960A5DB52C49D3E7
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0xD6E4634B57F4E948CB1BCF2A3C069AE6
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0xF9D68790787B87084117DF9931419477
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x0E1F0419A979E5A891D78AC2E688FE2B
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x87EE290037EFFFAF2D675DE7E496BD92
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x25B6E4CC75D9C82FE1F0B5C953691D20
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0xC0A882A1E294D95385E1C719896BECDA
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x554888883A89D80A79827897887F98F9
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xE2D0B1DD5D504B79A791845EE020C63F
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x0DDD84C6787899D8C4CB7B07BBF6CBAE
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x196328B3007771A5489E2825E53B7323
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0xBB0E5FF43EC3D2C338EA9DCF0D9148A3
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x24ED2672375608F1F0163F23AF01DBBB
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x2F9F513F6D8B31E300076BD15929F4F8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x1E99D4BAAA07A788FE8EF178AA985504
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x66AA5F870C81131DC0501F4309309084
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x76E6D06374B52F82298D7EA37991C19E
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x3A2984D8F9311DF720A3DAFF438F503D
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xE4562AB87AC6984E39A7550A9FDA5A10
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x0316AE762F8E02487A048A719F30C781
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0xA384F88FCE5E644ABE2599961463740C
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x0399387DF25D78998EEDE313888A5037
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xBE3391568F77FC27890854405EBAFE88
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x155B17EA6D23D7C6F1DE466AB9BDAD40
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x705E7E94C602936410AC96B6DA2B8D1F
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xA6425DF8901F760FBDAE8386FC2C2CF7
every effort of that sort.
0x0ADDA938DC6913F904E5B6842CB0C4EB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0xC4DFE598B278F087C915B9E0A0A465E1
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x19DF4BE7A613F7BB41C18A1417C63C66
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x24F51BF06F711BA8BD136E71E83C55FF
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0xE4BFB379D3E1A45AA53607B7C7249EDC
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xEDF14ACDF4D710CAC5E32EB44807B2C1
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0x0B3B9F4B8A17A4923963ECA05E3B2D9B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0xE549B5CE8D55588DACD05AA6A6360175
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x56FFD4862A0C604427F3F581384AF0CD
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0x4639C58EE76627069C5180597566582C
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x8B6259A62473E83E4F1557A04933D6D8
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x36AB5AEDFB37409FB1879C80AD6B8200
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x62C2C3A6D1EA813DA5AE16550C3C69F3
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x2E2B4309B8A300C666AE8194A289AFDD
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0xDA45F03B23F6EC673707363D86E65C42
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x02E390396C59FAA4C0ED5E45F0F747EB
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x494C2D2ED2A87C978C29DF67F45CB1B1
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0x96973F1F3F19321976D1E98D4506A3F9
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x7FCF35E318B964583F1E015254DF9BF5
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xAB1EEC3CE7F253F933536C3B520882CA
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x21C6EA914737F21AA6CE2BD37760EAC5
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x72505B8A31A2CBC7B445A099671AE83E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0xF8E5EB384CF7553EC85AF034384E076B
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0x22460CF50DEAACC4AA391EA2E5120588
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x64378B3CD690B887BA8FA197D9859593
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0xFAD8D94EEB109B6C901C60B323679B44
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x6DA142D92EB00EA777D5958D5A737F29
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x9509142692C8A2D6480A8EA079502C53
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xCAB2556F03193E7DA649C9F205CF877C
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xAB991C3A804F59AF62CF279A8E293252
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0x10FFE3E06B3E6CC9D473E870DA6D5F34
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0x837B6F9D5D5F62D40C4206FBEF7856B5
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xB270E20A47FD6929CC286CFF19E913E1
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0xAEBB3B8CED88A1B61A8F0EB2C22E10EF
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x59B9AA18FD634E5D4CFF5E050A88D189
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x17E473A045087F2C834D4D58E8586442
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x71E47CE427817F735C7E9E7D241C78C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x0CFA69589354DF2DB60101763C319982
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0x81E3AB240C56B354D7BE1816C447DC2D
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x80B13B6377B3803EE551543364B6B07A
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x893AA163A0F28B06ED19C6507F1BD651
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x09DE975578EE792F922C9FE752645448
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0xE4F2DDA70256DF6B55A3241FAC629D8D
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x3CAD52CFBE67D81F38FF558A97A51BCE
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xF2C976C71521C3995757BB64245DE501
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xE114E3CBF42A54726D4FA54B74BBD1C3
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x97291C031344A7AEE0E8F61508F15332

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xD773BD63747A85CB6A25447C49994626
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x38F16199E70D6231B69EF24E17FB6F1A
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0xD238DACCBBCD8169C56632D3B6AD12BD
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x907C26A442D668CF53FD6D48295C9B5A
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x68C1493E1DBAD6B03E126007DD299E7C
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xAA956080C20664C8177B22CA3C1D9F17
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x4951754A8DA9E8190FEDDA1658FBA34B
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xDA423DA4F0DDEF0ECF68C3A8394ECB66

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x7EE61861A3F5BC08D4A4507ADBDA7769
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x0F64262B75D0826061B84E24306F8D60
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x4EAD66267F42CE69EA76CCC0518C21C0
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0xDBBCE122C3C72EF8FD71822AFCF8EF0B
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xCA1EA4D3BFB0B6B322682E2FFA7C1878
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x185C1E3761C2147E64E54D488D16B529

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x49168C5AE6ADCB069061298E98D0D215
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0xCBD6D2D8C8C0DA79A40E7A2E31A501EF
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xAFBE55881BE7270201FEE971A0171303
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x0F03D33142E83EEDBB8D77A34C443564
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xF7E81543AAB45CB9AE1A41CA43D34CFC
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0xBE3E3F81DBB2F878423B1FA02E03AD59
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0x5E281B8006B99778998047030A9DB8E9
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x025C8AA8E35F8A8ACA23220467A33349
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xCA9441DAC2E47F9DF7487BB138AA9D20
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xDB7CB15D58BA7110A393D6100A6DF6A6
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xB56D541E57E54B7B0BA71BB26F26A628
me.
0x567A9B2B16F92D6B6E4C92F75468A693

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x0EA9C1954AF62FBE2CBCB44E16CE9088
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0xB0834A3D88638B94B00BDF41BBFC75DA
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0xEB729330C0917F350B4C80CE5A0162C5
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0x3B9B1578FA1755978B95247BEC38CEF3
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0xBA856E74E2CF77B792CC1CCF89E91E91
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x4B461F59F6CF49361A08303EDA87B579
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x070BDB7165DC2DF14E109153B6BF4100
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xEA2E05ACDF864C1D6ABB85C518CE3CDA
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x5C490EBCFAFEDD92F2140D1DA0D24D62
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0xC6BB91FF29CBBA77B45BCEF9D46D308E
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x5831E06D701CBBE78C8333F08CC79103
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0xC0225D119FAA2BFE9D718749887BFE06
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x1EFCEFA85E1ABB1F18D5218AC8BD56B3
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xA7F273A2D6EAE12D730BAB1C2ABE067A
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x21082833DF39889EAA6DB69DA6FE9280
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x3A9ADEE896CE79C57D537E7A93270A2B
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x511B412B0FA662B7B618BEA7B3CD7735
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0xEB028A49E00E79DF24E07E6DA5599461
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x4921C9C149D88D94F555C1523D77700F
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x303C71B4929668C090E82CAA761261C8
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x38E42EF0F0547B63BDAC18EC026B0F2B
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x28BC2908F2FA6653770336C1A46E38C0
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x3FE3E5FD7121F4CBF319ED5C8CC1ABFC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x8D83D59DA3BC3924137CD12B35AA0739

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0xC65CE4E2C849DE90798B9ADFBB4DDB70
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xDBEF9495E65B5AA95A99172C211E89D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x98FC65B93861598EB19213682693E4B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0xD2202660A764C8C826CFAE10370202D8
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xAF508F01612FF5F93D6106526C3DE82A
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xF65165BDFC3CA73B5183B2EBBA428ED0
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x5D58FB81DE3449FD6F0BD83A1B8CB3F9
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x3D2FE931D728C205AA2E0DABE4EA162E
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x54FF4EC53E8F4CE24A714CD4D3041452
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x2A5095BE8A13E52F998F62EE659F02E1
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x0273C8BDB36D4A000ED028EDFED7247A
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x41F9E05E408DB26D3F9772738F3C33EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0xA3DF36611CB7D095EC715E119C80A739
now drew near him again.
0x6C6DE3B131C766D57E0DF7FB92C2039D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0x1712CAA698866468084B516BBD2E3C11
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xEF163CBBECC79627F49088153AD1417D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xA3C1E7C383E8C1126D7BCD8C7ADEFB34
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0xED8BD38302813394E0F24E537F17C566
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xA17AC770AB7D374FEEDBCBEAEE030E30

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x124A54F5B6485AFAC6BB2F0268849FD0
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0x5BC9950A2D1F2A116EEC9E13704BC794
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x396C5D7232DE176D0858A1B626907BA7
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0xCE2CAE62021A580D86DDE423D8292116
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x8F23F37918E316E620559889646844BC
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x5B34FCC1DD82E8586124649B8721626E
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0xF6EBE149607CE70DB547B01AD361219F
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0xF8BD2A7E1C67E769C87528D823B69ECB
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xF0BA5DCE334D1BC57CC129E8E2052BDA
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0xE8DC36DD166FB76002CDA904C91F82C3
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0xDF6333A2F2B132E3B649E499E339FCEC
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x22AF8F7B34056664AD837EE2FF164B16
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x4AD862349068811EA386CDFE428D16CB
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x7F8BC3691A888866DA68A940BF282A9E
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x77DC5AE0D3D2C150A9D1868B93A45701
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xCED73CD7C1498C681E8727BC8B0D0322

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x4FFC9146908C8AC577F5A6D9ADFE2671
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x61B52FDE5E87E4F7AD789DEAFFBC21B0
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0xDB31845E74F0A20998DDE08D85DEFC90
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xAB59454799A6D615B767680F78AB3C5A
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x395497743BB844AC255E89877DB609DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xFE9617D4617D488C603F2C0FC30B402E
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xD6B500B604DD673FE11BC2C3EB555C59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x3599C653D256AA405540F2FF4D4F9965
direction before.
0x54A955E78B9E0F0B5DEFA0A6F1258382

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x92B293C528A10A5A3F822754DF4A1B18
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0xB4C451DAFAA9A47F0E7A7CD7512C0466

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x78B88F666A19305E91525C0112FCFC34
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0xE229F397C7C5FEE367BF28073FFF4F69
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0xF5362806EC730E0C0FA5824F5573AD3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0xE30FFAFAD88CC12CFB0B9C238959AA77
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0xD53878DBD8E69E84ACD9E1D8D93027B2
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x4487898C6C3AA861DF7BDF69C9CCA95D
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0xAF13F5DDC35522B330AB6D501B26E448

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Whose house is it?"
0xDAD21EED556D8CE4796E28C5505C924C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester's."
0x6D4D544BEF205A142BA72B7BBEBC5486

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0xB44C5E68D849F99BA523B16223F6E5DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x531336B1BC498B2FAC9DFD10C9114D81
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x9C2E3E3C5A8A5FF537BDAF0550727948
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x49D94511A5CD414455549F7D868ABA94
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0xC054EC7826554B01C8F7D03FBD70B139

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am the governess."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x0DF00ADC1C35E872B6613932F710103B
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0xB1D88AE00CB04225FA5577D8B9BDCE67
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x7A34C738E6BA80902347CD8E59718F4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a

little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0xC2C7EE9F4355C30987CC15B6C1E1359C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x248D9C2BCB11384D64206A69D5B16FE8
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x0366EB18305441441173BD0C5801D940
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0x32083DCFD1867F3C32BDD37646B7B665
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x13E29D41E3C9D80A647098D32F747AFD
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x06F4ADF06D53C4A8145C58CFEDEADD1A
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xDECFF0F219F2E4D80C0BA94462333F16
he laughed.

"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xD2563D2360E5186C7E8AF12E9C924F7D
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x5A1F11D0FDB2C438A9E34A11BD2BCF09
come here."
0xA05FA87ED01E98EF94323777F5CBE62A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0xC6AA5B6364E36B4E5A4157184B0B6A7D
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xAD3F4EB9A1DD2FF9B25B48A591E5FB7A
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x74438E56F95FD4CED14E8DA8653E14FA
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xC06588181CB8FFAEF348CAF5D4FF1F15
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0xE1D65A1E4BF097E388CAB19BA0934B9F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x5F93C553C222B9F17AD24F3C21BF76AF
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x027281702759383C58F928D8522105B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I sought it and found it.
0x41A991E5697B4FFFE02F8EA0B8E2AA04

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0x31793ACE654DE738740B5DB981E7C247
you can."
0x10C52DB6BFF326A9C8F4634B21B60698

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x12FACC018708656C8B4B51DC8C5E5FD1
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xB6224E036FCEF422D175E913998DC685

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x287276AFDF6C041C869A4983BEDC817B
   The wild wind whirls away."
0x8E4EC88AB01C8F479045939B5CFBC0F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x0C1DF9AD327A741834566333E05CCE5B
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x10437ACA1AC3DC84150E8DECCC801BBA
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x3AD3E299C3F5794D49EC61B9AECB9C80
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xD60A267371BE183830AE9799058EFBD0
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0x5E4A145048CA4E5AFE3B7D1B3EF57C1B
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x8E078368F13CE55FE9E5ADED3B69181B
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x5E7463DE7D9ECFC5AAC69DA5EFDD694A
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x0F650700CB2D0C9A909080E9E5680699
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x11FA253A5120E01B606C8EBFE54D131D
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x67590BEB656700B2C06202562FA16485
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x237D1257ED273B934C7836EF333CC9F0
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x645FD32A47D381D06119022B38EF0731
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0xB179292631675EF8419DBD4239FD41B9
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x1826FDF663F225B12D5EF5A25743C7A7
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x906D076909565C92A1A3D8B309B464A7
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x7CB404FCDDDAE0930737A3A146293AA6
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0xD93DC064BA265371ACBE10759D04559E
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0xFBA9EA6F342878B66190184D43126A45
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xA2A21D61A99BDE36AE3FB916F4DD33E6
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xF045EF20F463D70731FE83B04C567DBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0xC3A155DA6802B613EADC80FB5D971A44
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xABFAD13CC9E119098B1BF283198DE3C5
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0x4D6872049E813B761BF13889B74E157B
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x50F073A2FCB63D488A0432F883237051
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x74720C39BB6B1744567616AA87AB41DF
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x91DF37F96F22C4260502DACED0DC13CC
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xA12CFEA18EEC74D522E5A1CAF0F3EE28
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0xBA42C25995AAA10DA6F7E6EEFA4436FD
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0xA230A54A61F26DD7447B7C17E961C4F0
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x0BEA42D7F2C95AD3E096A1910BD3310D
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0xFC0318B756AF587C6A4902F4C3D0DBBD
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0xC94875B711B088556146B5A11D732E75
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x807BBF4301E310BF7CEFDBF33B4C05B6
as it would be under his.
0x4206A5BD123AC94F252EE658E11D6EF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xAF8C3B000B7F39AA3B83D31BFF89B693
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x7741B9C54A329D05B1FD0616B0F64CFB
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0xD60565DFB3428E523480BDE3A85EB7AB
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x48E2626653ADA2744738A61D5908A368
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x01949FA34F035F749CCEECA5D93E129C
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xE03525171A09EF193445BD707E0A7748
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0xAD81CB03B6F45ED93300D19B1AAEDF4F
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0x2D67910F4ED5CCE7B44F282D9FF5CC95
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xAFD041372CBE438E60A1BF1722AA44A6
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xE59524C1673686B0BED7664D8DA6F4B0
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0x43A294813D051C044731D5CC4947C568
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xFC51AA3557C1A18B64E3208C64744305
door, and went in.
0x6F8E6428827A952D6C4A9513E6B0CC42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x7AFF28865F2691FB55317B67C16F4EF2
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xED0318798C1CCF7B3A0C6791946646CB
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0xD4B964F2B3F6763419F63217E47DA532
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x24FDEB10D32B1D0D7F46136122928CC7
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x492A719EDC6D48FC7F37D0629910B6E6
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0xF8CF090B314CFD11463F610D61D077E1
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x12C19325AE9B23F5C4CD9E4EE7FAB9E9
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x9CACDDE07E4740646DE260148F8070FB
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0xBF57FC4E35C5389A2949891E4D853C2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0xDCD8C34FC4C0C3DFD8AD328E2E2F8CC5
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x989154227130770B2B8BB03CC598971D
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x47147E664F8518F18238BC72337F8A78
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xFB125A9E6994065962DEAD33E99A498D
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x9BFB389A6856795BB878B8EED7730AAF
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0xF20D149C3E56A81FCD6FB0A0096A1C7C
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x48D48E935D96D932B263ABC58926ADEE
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x0AC0089CCD2F3755DCA8EEC0D334191D
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x17BE0EC7EB09A723AE7F67AE90B86FF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xB578EEF74154515E337075AF92714137

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x4C8DBBB6ECCFC9DBEF22FC72A192F262
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x76E89D6EDA4440BEBE680C2DCB49F86D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0xDD05A3F9BDDA20B6B002305E319F1573
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x2C5EBD62857CF5CD2D949AD1A2E6B0C5
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x3F5C3A00DAD4C7AEA450877804EE8D78
upstairs to take off my things.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x3B2224C049F21E8FD6E54952E4A22662
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x9D1BEC348A7C17A29083141F5C06D4D4
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0x918178603838D00159765DCF538C6ABE
and waiting to speak with him.
0xCE69F6DB085365F4DC01E99919327905

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0xC8E8A9AB8A01FF8B0934992F34F189EF
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x7D10A2693E35CD55CA42AEB705EF433D
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xA7C3E8B1180B7CF0947A4D471CEC51B1
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that

Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x221491037DD231213458D9F11B0A7ED1
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0xC1A55610058FB0CCFFDC32664B34BB0D
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0xA311493718833C2E2C8CDE9F58571D62
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x367489C1E422EDCFFEBD7872727EC424
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0xA9E8257B6229607B69A8237BEEC1E6FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x2A1BC5CCE7EE016D8C5DD0E6DD6151C0
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0xEAFE406B90BF14175F0A35159FDC8B7B
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0xFBAE8A768634B7A29460645116698A9C
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x47E0E5E9337FBF7B9632AEECFA8CDC67
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x51E561BCA5B83E9ACCC9B9B0A9373B38
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x99A78C332288B07E551E8E8C39BAE512
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0xEE65D2C657DD7C82FB5F4DD249DDC57D
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x71FA87A94A6D571DE00348A5AAA4CAA4
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0xE326CAB9504A14F9BDBC2186063132C0
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x12AB9B6323918A36B77F8B7106D66D56
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x46549E7C4884BA621F71C1BD763FBECB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0xD8308E4D869B5A4E567D85C2FA9687C9
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0xB4E8B4F9339F61331C7320D6167A77E9
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x0D4F4E5456D0B4E9CF5267286FCECEFF
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x6201251322A7137A8843A6A3D86F3212
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x6556CA77FD455E42E03AB35310ED8FFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0x72033EEABBC0812372420D7A41F25568
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x6937DED09E62C9AC8A8D6AB7B65B3B83
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x8BA6AF6ED6B63549C9C94DC6F4290D3D
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0xAA959BE8B8AC44324DCF6CFEFE008C57
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0xD37E6545E9CF332FC68B109DB1753098
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0xAF06D21A23B77E58B2F2EC92FF9C621C
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x438596F6488B980811AB5D78AAD03FA3
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xD137A57538CB07337240CDF42F909F8B
fireside.
0xD56D7E435E048846D1E4ED2142EAA683

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x80EE06077E65A4B39DC88EFEB2ADF77D
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x9284F6D101D986454B540146731305D3
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x72CEE7814E617381C092D284942E7DD6
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xAEB679345AC2B434257F9B22E666BA2E
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0xD12CD13DE76B1D90D014BDE298781C29

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xECF1F390E1243A05C63DC07469F146C4
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x0F0B5F2E039CB5227CEBB7A7A9C4039E
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0xCDF199239EEC39D7C2A9FCBF722BE25B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0x3F558E6973A97314C495248421329C81

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x7E67953396852A7E94FEED0759C71BE4
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x2D354B684A668A00E2C19A2A9304EB23
candle."
0x0A1F10112A1DFE5015AACD9616D0078E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x024151FBC921AC0804F7B06F176857F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x709A48B923247ECF546F08B29EDA1D22
is here."
0x7FFEE3F3F6F5F02F2210F1EE968900CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xB49BA2BE9C139DFA685C8C038751F34E
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xB56AD187CFAE4C00F5E0BB56DA816A09
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x2B8FEC658CCB45544AD947FBFBA2A2EF
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xDA484EB867AF98930FCFC8DDA224E067
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xA1297BF85CE0E7AB6C6C1CE248F3E2BA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0xBD088BE2E8A770F2788BDE70B5A88BF1
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xDFC40D0B3A6A29C32C4AD3364386D4A5
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x526625BC00AB914FE863820C2430D72B
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0x8A317C7D81FE22EA657810AA1B0AF3DF
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x69495B59C27E423420CF126214EF676E
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x12B62D787C3D026F8EE9E626D620B466
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x1EBE84AB2715C8AB0C24227B184B8EBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0xB78B54897C9444CE954966FA5EF0AC90
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0xB045A0EC016B6C4DC46274B15501A2D7
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x9FFC60DC916B57A03AAE2E248B94A2F9
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0xBF002D5D1235B4D57907ECA88B1FB8EE
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x9342014B5F09B04088F699637A674391
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xE1BBF15CEFFEF6C56EB137FCA17FBCCD
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0xBE455A20895CA9882C1D0DDB8F2467B1
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x686EBFE8125F8AC512CF4C2A443BCCDF
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x1749B6EBE819CF29302E8551CD491AB9
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xD16FCD39DB8790DE3659A56389D8F409
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x0B1BA6FE65258B037277A6CF6CF6A128
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0xB0BA7D194DF6DA313E1A7C61BFCD387B
neither tall nor graceful.
0x3E36945475D2519EA015DC7A91E22DA1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x74ECC4BC82CA7BE6604DBB7D44A7AF52
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xF29F5F43C8BFB6650592C884340A3271
lifted his head as we approached.
0xBA750A13D6DF03353F67319FA9DA5E9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xC385BDA1930BB9B054004C2A14B9F101
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xFDBE16C521E9B2E16D85CBB7432E0116

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x76BAB80FF3F4B7DD71403374AD1B4F15
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x00B0ACE6CE037B25A50E850004ADF3A0
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0xC6BD39038108B8EF0308B6ADCA323292
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0xAC0057C219FB4146526CB79F12467FCC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x790A16C9E617D4D0A8960FE68B546957
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x5BB2B464B760D4A08115398C138805BF
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x615426C9C2A92AD4B495E84E5FE87EB6
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0xA4E0D9CDD022F6FD72427E80CBA1DF3E
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x9832C3C37595FF97D083E8C55EA3C874
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x97C58CFF8DE6AF0611C6BDD80E011042

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xF5FE85D8707986CA73B15BFDAD7FEE41
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x2886624900ABC09F59BD03884E333332
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xAC61847BAD68EDF28974318FEA95ED30
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x20B4BAA9E498CD4B3CE00BB9D5814AA5
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0xCE826D7DF095EF5E568938468E179C25
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x321FE0DACA05BB5E0B63AAAF285A2C66

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x25E114A445F9498EEECFD5BE117D6BDE
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x1642A03E9659B1A5FA7583D1ADD8C924
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0xAB15B5574315A88D80BE4AFB39DB453C
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0xCD037260C753B3ACB03FFB0341625D95

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x2F7D1002327D500BA037595AD15501E1
might perhaps spill it."
0xD5AEDD24540BE86DC888E004D002F7B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x2FDB9F758DB79D4BA57050E2DDCD6B7B
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0xDE01AA06D6DCF2384A95044674F87805

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x49AB63C68DE933AFDC977B404DAD1FEF
votre petit coffre?"
0xF87223EAD20A50B7DC836C24144751FC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0xD00E91319DF3D1E8E4724068B20C4DDA
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x038B09734779ACA93339A220A5EB3E02
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0xBE14FBC3F9554D489711924ACE66D95D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x00BEDDE3465BEE1468647180EE1B13DF
thought pleasant things."
0xA6EBB6E1939E8C82FD655AD33C69E776

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x0454C63B14F472A78AB882DFDCF7EB08

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x46EFBCBBDD7102A8DDE7329731EA8D11
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x789B3F8E9F5EF3EA1E36EBC0CC10BFE8
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xBEAE1DFDA978C4198EF070B582A8F8FF
nature."
0x2C6D2D5F288D0E830C67EC24F7AE92AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xEDA0E2D63431C68A9F38F16EA020EBAD
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0xF08A13DC7BCB10AF9A074442807E3FF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x60D12D9C9200ADABB5A451B97EEB9EBE
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0xFD139D13D2D839358AA4819A2C1BC29A
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0xEC8023A319D6AF56399D97471692BE38
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x4AACCD0C05E351611D12B7EA75B49A39
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x00D4C7ADE86C743EAECF29B48AFB59FF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x1448C8D0E91A6C0F1BF4F2E444B4B08C
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0x64220295B0B038C3A16A0593CD45FF20
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0x10194C159A2CC7CF752EB2879515158A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x1DAF0BB3461584223C498F7357400A7F
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x40B57BDE3C3E1C820E1FA68A8CE2D04C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0xC26B56D7CBDB41E73815D4B8EE6F829B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x5849D8BF9315C114663CF36836E0B293
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0xB9AF1EE922D2D73508D4D9CAF58183D3
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x5092EEFD72A4534FD6896B55EE55A42F
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xFEE222C177389519E2135689CE66284A
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x85CC56CB2C8CE7F8A77FBF76DAB401D5
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x733D7FF287593AD0E038C7B608AC7DE5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0xE18DD3FBCF6DA11229FCEBA5AB5F1FBA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you came from--?"
0xF7BB9F0D26CEF7A2F897719AFFC0A778

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0x2096EDA0E21FB7F3A18CBAD1A1EABC81

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x604D67563154F7A48B7E71CDF1E965C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Eight years."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in

such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x44A8A7BFAE040F62BFB29914096F8A4C
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xB560DDE6B78F26BBB6D6C6A6C5446022
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0xC3424ADE22F20B09D53EC6BD4908A658
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0xC18C8A9FDF820B2A4EA33E7BF0B774EE
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0x78602765BF8A4252FAE7486AF83CAE89

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have none."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0xECF87167D77BB4A1C0A03FBAF5F35AE8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0x0D88C7CD2AA250DDE4E3B8115B7277EB
that stile?"
0x55C5765E317091EB78E1862A3D1CADAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x488930CC6D836104681A55AF72B7F25B
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the

0xAC062314282ADC850CAB570071925AA8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0xB5EADE285E14B82007E82F1256842A8D
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0xD60809C2276808803BDAFB13BB66A7F9
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0xC72035F3B9F09683C5DE27ECE87ECFFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0x2265E72CD7FBFC40513E157DC870B91B
wondering what sort of talk this was.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0xEB01951DC741D50BE9DCCD53C018A529
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x8AEBE451C88F6C9612F796761E7294D4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0x6996C6E9A4E2E1455990433C57DE7C6C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0xA90B3E6CD55457BF8EEE2ADC9B1FC5EB
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x23A85ADDEB52ADCCDBBAD5D324BA417E
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to

Adele."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x44FBE6E049074D5EAB96401FCC3D8A16
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x625CEE4532BF9E241CF576891574D122
felling my horse."
0x2D0AE59C5FA136385307C6616F8CF217

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x6BE28943A4EF3FECC0E60B9AA27DDEAC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have to thank her for this sprain."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The widow looked bewildered.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0xA5C2942A4F259A5AEC95B6384E54AE64

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you seen much society?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of

"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in

religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a

parson, is he not?"
0xB24BE75BA81B92144AB5491F806B348F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xDD4F83368E0AE34F8025A49B0EE24E0E
would worship their director."
0x9B2BC29AEEF8128169D6CF91171CE5BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x9774B95AC8DD55D0BBED7D479E51D267
sounds blasphemous."
0xF5CA085520474C5DC37DCD088E59E1DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x061AA21E6DA60A69B78F18699E975259
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0xA07917AE280E856247592A6D746DF629
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0xE4D827BE2B1ED29F8180941576449929
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0x29AB5CCC72EBDB9338F29ECDC8A0F7C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.

Rochester.
0xC1C5AE4B1FDA7B1B71C87D72A70D5DAA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision

department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0xD9382DB2FD47272AF54ED8F9F91289C1
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x8E3DA0582B65249D20009FAD103B57E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x2DCD8E99EFA81761F26FE9504F71A000

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"About ten."
0x2392270E81E9DC36068B6169B997FC9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0x57AF41627AC2AABA501A3854DECE8DF6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I assented.
0x55544CB52682024715A3492C9AB9CF52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x8A5C6ABB22FC71729F93498540451174
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0xC09098EDD119583E93BDA69EDA2BC903
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0x1FD470D2D9641939C8903E388AF08F61
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0xD187598E0698C185CDBEFEE921536B75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A little."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,

if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x5513C886B01DDD7EEEFF5D931ABFE820
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0xF47B3037201BB45222BDE0F7D5B8AC2A
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x292AD06CBF53ABCBC32822613D11B8C6

0x066DDC55BCC100C62CC420D4B66BFCCC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I departed, obeying his directions.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0xFE18DA16C75A3BE604D15E208CB7B512
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0x85990BED466901355D2E74AE6E722DBE
not well."
0xAB496115C18EB49C2B2525DCF9467055

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x2FD9025278CB22C6661970E604B8D3B7
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0x104379523FF7F4CB56A0264113C84F39
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0xDFE0ACBCEA383C623DAFD90CD2AE1831

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, indeed!" I interjected.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x081868FBCC252929C9ECAC0B5DD38E16
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0xEA88E347A8B283A7B1F52F1D3743E932
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x32690083E55C9BA23706165DE6772591

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x11C0E6A4C93C6CAB73F81771D7764930

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x523516B88B764E3A89524A2451D27517
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x7B9C34C1E010CEB8E177BB857B1E1AF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0xCB7F59CDCF9DCFBAB7E2305B1F12BD3E
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0xB47951A15E1C225830F58CB5CDCA44FC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0xC988E75A944FDA3BB551873B4BC6EC60
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0xAC0CC34408FB8087F03F8C0545B25862

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xA85CEB535894F932D0640EE2923C2D83
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x78E69FAF97BEF91B5BE03AEAED4D552C
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that

hand yours?"
0x6EA1EB367E9261E5E78A453CD97CEF4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x7F8D83A27F7519E48FF6D17310EBE77D
some thought."
0x4D595FBD9805E82232C17D4362F8EFE3

"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0xDB0753A44B8D4ADA234A191C6C3468A2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xF1F4F6EA9731ADAB07E30CE732505A81
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xB788331FFBBB0EDBD2B69EC43BFFEE16
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xAEA5B9FF6638087BE78D26FD65112D30
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x56A9633092A8A7AA3B6B3591ED43887B
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0xBC83D35473FC366C65F98123D77A6326
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x6539920479B5CE110C5AC4E301DB82A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x01F174717058FC3059153833F82E9FEF
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x2F60C440AA2D91F31BECA21CFDED6A2E
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0x75384DE2C36BBE4BB94B80EDBD318CA5
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x16A30BAF1F9196ED47C3D2BE03DD3F7F
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x6C317B960CF1C9165C0BE3EAD3E72F6F
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0x8DCC62E4B9E69700A979DF75E8F8766E
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x7E0C2A462E0C2F799724672B8C397DBE
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0x0A4B160A6451A8036BDDB1706318002C
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x1851029E84BD0BF7ED291FE06EBBF956
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0xA0305BFB2AB65067F8E58F0983A06549

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0xA4052C7DA80579D37875BFA05D446FE1
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0xFAC439D21C738507DCF2DA894DC61855
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xF37320AD325A6708B825579DDBBE6227
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x44B667DEB6BDCA08F8AA128BBE91E015
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x591CB523375F4179159A6D8D2DA65C9C
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0xF5C516B498EA58FED693C9B106B65062
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x3A94C11B424A380130BC065F88A21FBA
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x132B139AE5A2A30F5420FD5629A87A3D
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x74D1B582CBBEFE0BD0B8B7CEEA0302E4
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x3A9C03CA289749A608C63E357B730049

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x99E0A11FE9638A80B23EDCA1318A1A56
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x59B25F7C51C26864325749E5B4F1A3D0
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x268AB59DD608EA1F80C91CD4B39CB5FD
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0x96956F2750EF39B312FBF5D91C638231
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xC8F9C38F3147BEA4AB0712B2538A9788
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x9F27F215D7D801D76FA3B3DB96778BA7
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0xB2E518B00CED55D1F4F2F97FEE6F7FD2
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x807ABEF276B6F26B7E7E2AA856DC5951
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0x32BD18DF6D63D2DE129811DB9A17208A
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0xDF48C56CBED328B2C656E04D79C8385D
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x9828086E389B52C773A8E5D49CEA5818
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0x68B77809EF0764954CBC705B819E309E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x1D1515538199E4E2951B1C278F0CAF52
presently.
0xA93B69EAB86F15B0652FA8115D59AC7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x64F039C6B9CD0B4EAABEE61EB48B4A05
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x6A696AD724674F897E45D571FD8CBA60

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0xB8639D59EDC9B2924A3A9F2FD12BAEF3
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x2F3E1E009D87188A02A128ACEA866F50
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0x43C4866129899B423116204E30B21939
each day?"
0xA4096D91BA8F921CD1C624CD66136761

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x495324FF8E70C9D8B27B199C006039C3
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x4DCBD18B9558A03AC2BBD86D042C2DF8
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x3AD3E55A77D3BEF5C59A86F3BF996FDE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xC43042B0B66B3A1877C1E206A0EBE7CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x601BB3D7B920C38850D00F8299985D31
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0x5CF01D2B4296177A215A9164D0017E10
powerless to realise."
0x8CF52BF2B014E7566FC2E3BFA1DB971F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x73BB65E30C0DED67799DF6A1EC384B78
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x552DDBC208B2D3662E35F3B1A60AF973
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x8679B58BEA9EBBAA156949697DD9CA14
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0xA205B3BDCC0B8A0208F39C0CD2EC4D2A
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x46CDD150B9538B1C1D919555E7428302
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0xF551FC6E387D2128AB7076FFC405D2C4
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x2081738EEB21A0738FFE033617410BE3
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0xA8DE630391F9B37BD30E1DEC410367B4
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x93D1BB4B6824746C7153CF1E05E1309F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0xFFAE4D80AD71A3D6723C9CB96AD96D2A
watch, he said abruptly--
0xD082B1FFC1C31EAF3258DFE5FC6C1EFD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0xAEC9440A223B7996B2B9A292F42CC06F
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x03A8AC9CAB25B6B08D3FE8D9A8BCE2AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x7E331C01131D47D71F9A3DBBB173E0C1
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x6513D31A8766FF0770E6ADFFCF6B3B7D
much.
0xDDD6BE7CB7446C9E960B83CFD74A3C20

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x0D08099942988F6007994B9FE78EBA42
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x4D67CAD69CFF282D3383E2683C95044C
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x9D6BAF322CD20C1F12786332D6461062
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x5E3B6C16E6816616A972B2DED4BF7093

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0xC91475837BA9B35B08C98CBC7C95D2AE
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x131C25A868E1B1A85B46C2D38714B34A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, is he?"
0xB74E8C48A6E78C638E355B932F9974D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0xA8A84FC004A9562B326DC54CC676420E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0x6DAD550F796166C37C7B7B31D376CB60
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xB71BD04967D54AC75088609D7B5519E3
temper, allowance should be made."
0x141505237C22D7BD28FC9629A4958319

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why?"
0xC0DC147323FFEE0B309F7B3E64505D52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x763531AFCAAD6402337CA2D248FC6E1B
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xF35A3BB4C569AE2B85EEF7A20E8570CC
make his spirits unequal."
0x12A7B48AFBBA51E936D5B11DEF0859EB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What about?"
0x4E872410DD553C6ACE0BD6A9A19DAD46

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xB0E401140376091BF38A20F84E048282

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But he has no family."
0xE6BAD9A80536B9BCC058FDEB05CF0F85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x047517629F6DCF904B1BE89D6DC13E14
brother a few years since."
0x734941791416AE6E2F84013304C468F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x1BFF0F17D3D94408C437337A6D77CB5E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0xDA600EC2D2DD6A0FABE21857E847DF39
the property; only about nine years."
0xE5D488CC0F7071CED1C5280B43DD2C39

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0x077F81EFAD85747436428CD1C971A307
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x8B65F07BA62ABAB99C9C69B5980ED505

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x27824165EA9BC712F4550381C08F1466
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x57DBB9001D0216297A4D89F0181CB21D
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x3431B4291A4DA4C22E2A6F967F46DAAC
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x6F43A8FDC1E1E69BEB66DCEB952E9BEC
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0xF4752F4AF8FFCCEA837EBF35B2D87AE2
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x30F16239E534C0A18D255F0674F0E8FF
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0xEAC67CD8818951E2B32D76920C849F11
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x28699F95E737FD32A919147F6B9EC4E2
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0x357A559B01F9EA7A09D4606765DBFCB6
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x93DA9F1B18A27F95FC371291CFA0607E
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xC369AD6B60BE31FC8725FC0ED6E47E6C
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0xA425AB5CF51E2D0CB2D97B1D8FC846BA
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x387F1942024C80A1D8D5ED335A4AB548
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x14584A8F195BFB40CAA3440AC3A3C586
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0xE82229A61AE873BCFF4C9973B311561A
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0xF720083F45EEEFE72DE09D22F36039BB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why should he shun it?"
0x07A378597B97492A766DDD342C8E0FF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x89F5E1EB9DDD97F66683E7BDFED92F61

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xEB70934B0957B0443B8D8BC91FA42635
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xC0D8BD0FB0E35EA5D5D5ED76542A48D5
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0xB037EABD25EB6916CF6540D449659C82
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x53E4CFD9223AB40F84C9328A4C3AE821
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0xD9E3659AE627335F32C2035009E8397C
subject, which I did accordingly.
0xC4D8A5D5D7313CA7C40F68C4544132F4

CHAPTER XIV
0x36B897C3AFC40A0C0E5FEB6BFA12AE27

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xFA03F302FE472928B9043FCE9A2E6DF2
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xE2CD63EB42372DDA937D1CAC31009661
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0x9F4737A482EE175547B4A3CA83803AD4
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0xC88309A8CEBCA9E5B8EFEC755781D7C6
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x0449BD23B04C126CA47FE378CBD38F2B
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x1FF5F6AF71E93997DB4026FFBB633164

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x6A045D606BC6EEBE82FDEC9E6B5A158A
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0xE966F7ED590C4D05D59DD8DA9A1933A8
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0xB7A85FCB96EEA1785E176532BE6A84B5
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x76294C8AF942274E812BC6AE279DD758
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0xE6A4B7A71A432958D034E252A6CAD471
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xECDA9BA72D45D2389B1A370A5A352F4D
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x5F88E71AF2411503D5EEFC82B7D33B7F
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x645CCC43E80F66E972A07EF6E8F44016

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0x9DCD0DFFB1F45E6D3F5DB8B8A70B5D5F
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x72676F61CE6008B223E6E95C92D35C97
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xA716DD99D5E5B64CEF38C4D22C632659
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x79FC2B48727EC46B05DCACCE9653D17F
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x342B1CEF9211C81CCC0037F910AEB2F7
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0x360E3D7D0C9922B05C024C2C74953D1E
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x8D02EB9985788EE985BA13BF6B7BF5FA
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x5FD21A0475F7014C1ACC44B9E03FCB3B
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0xE532F89F451B66A7205D08602A19BBCC
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x37419F4E2DE18B6175D1AD97FFF0C997
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x093D9FB6F82DC8494EFDC9327EB976F8
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0xB047FF18F0108BE2782C45300AC229A5
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0xF7BE25EBBDDA323AF08505816DE2AAAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x6B0A01F4889C888C64721BC16E0A0C57

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x4042C6DB7C017BFC0CAE30413C2803B5
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x876905F820B2ECC9286F6335461D08B7
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x72ABDC000EB62185D1DFFEEAA812AC1F
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x117B9787DF2788F54BA7666B875A330B
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x4BA284702D08BAD90A25A2AD7F260198
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0xD4E2B472EAB11FFFAE8FCCC127571636
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0xAEC697D4A0D838AE32AB9EF5071CEE75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x08516EC1501AED084453A166852B20E6
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x22F52A22ECA837B0D44701BD0CBFA91F
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xCF7CE14D2F22E99D8D869D4D72832A6A
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x02E031DE7D679D2720AE497408879A1A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xB49F067B7997397BFDC9A07827705CEE
contemplation.
0x84A450CC9F62F0FA4AFEF11F712BC6E4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x0C8A184A950F93E0DA292C19B8C810EF
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x20E92204E2BF38843611843E52EFB753

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x6190D5D62754D702292F9B5B241B8DA6
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x44E73FEA1BE136C7DF4F90DD2DC8B94F
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xECD32D4063817E2C7AD49164C56B9330
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0xE99C1A48199AB1ED99868B60A505A732
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x40696B41154C1190E4638BA54691B5AC
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0xE04ACDEF082FD6D61B7F4C6CAEEA7D09
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0xEF3F5756960D670878786949CEC16E80
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x70AA7A9CAB7001E98BA6E03FB224F3D3
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x87E68B547BF76C1FF160697BC49E716B
said to be thicker than water."
0x48C6B5E9FA34531384D0E6A89FDEF4CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0xCFF0DE506D5028506434B78FA1F4030C
knitting-basket in hand.
0x9A842922B82A1AC8D4687CA867828971

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x123C4A008116A02A198DDD071E2DFCE7
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x635418D495073D073514A55755C11A25
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xE1B7CFA88DC22A0EDC37111061C9E784
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xC84E149AFB5E84C6C7359A7CC3E69C15
performed."
0x916E8EEC00331EEF4532A85133E6647C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x1B368C8E66420DAE1B775DDFD403F502
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0xA7DEE79C37889B2D2C7AB62B7DEBD181
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0xFE17463BDE21FD97919834914947E5F8
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x322A3CF9AC0073D093EC61E01F231BA5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x67AD91E3904A411A7CD6C656757FBF19
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x20BCB138D02E03EE08C377B8A2BFB53A
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x69996F6C0AC235C238B19BAA9F1736CB
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0xBE1DB20B5034A1620DCE77E61207EA6A
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xDCFB48602B5E9FCD5C74870A8F6E8F47
mind to do."
0x6D3E3FCA206D015F74DF889DEB192FF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x135DC10359D56F051DBEAD559A47A0AA
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0x8A328FE11567043A654E65AE56B8155B
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x4DD2B6FCB0FC75397A12FB2900522E4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xA4471C7CA8FCB12D5FA2DEF3038367DD
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xE88C009FDEEE2190A30B8D0AC9F01157
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0xD56826038AF3CAAEA0EA3C690EF6EB76
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x49C71C62BA1635F6575D01C508FA5C5C
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x28460A4BE3B6FA8E775A5362045CCEF1
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xAA84FE5B115E68E4261742F982B129CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x0A978C6818F6CAC4A69EEF3481EA777B
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x6433AFDE6E395F286D2B8EFFE53BD184
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x57ED19BD430E433C1FFFC4E21225DCD9
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0xB860422852A20A58725D3C5BFF04C46D
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0xCA1AC827C973E8D3F77B5254626C1EE4
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0xDAE735DE8EAEE72F9E6644A5122C2467
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0x6B7F8F9B1D793FD41B827FF8F41EA109
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xEC920F67F41E9EA756956CC13AF50FEE
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x7C262FFED6979D85510FED39E7095A72
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0xBF70E64624E95498E2216AE3029CAE9C
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0xBFC6FA6CAA61D77217F0EB17C850939D
feeling.
0x3FBE0A94FD37C4EC33923C0983D41256

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x2126597E8BB25293B53512C3F5F2372A
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0xF6B6A71A19AB276554A78CC70CC2A419
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xF76E2565A8CF69441DE6F90B201C6CEE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x3745DEEF160A711E0FF16E844A8D69BE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x27710C06C07312FC4404590AE815D230
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0xC97F89842737FB1D747BECEE51136C4F
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x17A8E673FFBEB84DEA883221DA858BD7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0xE150423040242EFB8E760A4DA4501BCA
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x1D9539A21AC62FF7F2D10232861F8950
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x9AD3C4E4F2326CB09A90DB793054089D
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x5839183E2BC333E489B906B6543B1812
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x9256E729B99C0D26EB7C27029CCF5896
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0xC2EED4F2F80830DC0DDC20D7B27674B0
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0x7C3C2750BD8F10EAC83D3898312A7C2C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0xA25F79C63A339E05825357389B3F416B
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x8407E069E7CA2F3FD78D231CA6D5F990
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xFA898B85A1AA8E9DD769C5C14CC572DA
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xDE84BD61EFBDB02664E17C8BB6EC218C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0xEE66F60D73B77E8841BFB1C482BC2A87
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x291CB76527AE72A999C6399FD3E64D2A
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x30107C56305159A8828F1446E04B6B94
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x4F6F9E3830D2CA275D5C1EC1F2B7F862
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xFEF7E54D9E319DCD0EFDA120DD59ED9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0xF87DA85106473FB905B68FC791CAFED0
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x241D4D83C8DEF2519C723284F71892D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x8E1EEDBAA72EAC1F6F95B1F0045104CD
does my forehead not please you?"
0x334B663E141FDE42F18BA99F2CC006AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0xCE7B74C2A0BB17D1E4CAAE414F72D3BE
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x1A528F0592CA8AA49BC1BB0E96F9A4A6
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x26A34ADF66A2AB66A7B5462C23A4E4E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x8381EC67663A7FE3A674A99B1AE672F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x13F560B5C8022A71800C8E42B745D09E
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0xF6E60957E63F5AD5DEA489EDC8502413

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0xCA5506845067A1301D711D5710FCC91B
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x5D2CDE2AF88F9EACD8CBB88FECBC9834
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x19917D91292CC5323405BCB62F0ED2C5
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x13E77E7077A2006416919D4575E00B84
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xFADA7B732CA5303EEEBE9DCCA020FFC7
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x309B4B691062B5635EC111A3EE04064C
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xEE2EB2A4322076A560C092A1532DA957
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x5C70615E3AE02FD3400AD7BBE02FBCE6
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x0690DF705AFD3904FBFC31DFA0469183
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x0CF18087F38799349F4919D6D0083C36
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x5762F972F9B496696C19601DD5B225F0
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x7DAF01BE814CEC4787781654FB285AA3
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x3C7EA48DBDEF2CF6A1C681BFF759FB91
me?"
0x614D930FC1478F440FD1FE3568C83C77

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hope of what, sir?"
0xAD97AEA99F8EFA40C31BDF4D9B18318B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xFABB7612DBE9771CD0192524B790AB5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0xC098DE8FF904E38AA1B1A03FAFAA059E
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0xB5675CFDE32360FC02391ACEC5A0EA44
capable of being re-transformed?
0x6B356CA4E72CE631AE7C9ADA95D3A320

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x69E7BB46F3F1DF339AC66A0B83FD0269
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x55B5D58B901CF0E3DB212BC640CF337A
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0x513EFCFFC2C39BADAA505370E47F18F8
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x6A9E9802E189035B026C91041A84ED09
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x0788D46A98DC0AF400D86F9D3BB3C360
to-night."
0x7E2106E8BB5A03612C65186259794411

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x8D2C0B0108596A9F18ACC1D6C31869E0
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x0124037864C271E4305A152A823EABC0
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x6161363D95C0894B9933FB29C2BE512F
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x129B6F7A1E1A01881EB28DD55D1C65E2
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x2A08FF9C5AF688486C349948AE1C79D9
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0xCFC4F496CA3BB950249C40486D20B635
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0xE8D593634009540441A06B5085E7BC6C
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x27EE910C14BC163449A4296056B84C3E
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x3680C000D6F2059BD59F3B673DBC95A3
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x65DA335CD12922F10CC08D1CA0D63FE2
confidence.
0xAACADA47B5CD1A5EB02771E740786DD8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0x5DB9FA4BEDE7C31CCD79D21EE99B11F4
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x9D9662307E9564ECA2FE9367CDA8168B
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xF876B8E02F761F82F344707869941A7D
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x8EE3FE312F585284D140DF3FAEAEAA69
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x18C5BCAA88A3AC2D91E61B6C35A795F0
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xA205417D27E72287FDF64A0AAABE2369
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x0D4C7F4A3D258F30C451DEB55D8CB7A1
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x3EDF7584E96EE640BFCE8AA66BDFA076
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0x293583B3BBC5319A1E7DD5C79E55B54A
you--therefore speak."
0x042AB92593D695449D575BE9BC0C9687

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x48C361CEFD99879730EDA42E2815BDC1
smile either.
0x2DA664AF48D18BF3529064C8B955527F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Speak," he urged.
0xB84B4F96BADD5942AB1FE7CFE866084B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What about, sir?"
0xEF09B41C87F4A22333F86FE7557F63A2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xA939B07E984A74EBEAC5DE90E19D9B4A
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x05E5AE384177897D5867D293205E0E11

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x2C3D4E92E4EA0AB68A3C2B98D9A89A45
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xA36745959CCA2D14F9483F2FB89F5DF9
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xF05FD91DBA1E45E9AAC90DEB94BBF162

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xF7C33E0E2DB8C659637E70214E819C06

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0x733738AA13AC7664F6EBB047F9AF5745
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x293F15DDBFEC555ECBB4983777752795

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0x3FB7D6D638B7135AE4555D45887A823E
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0xEFA758C5E607FDF247E1912DDCAF868F
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x94E2AD3E41CCD2F654FB7A3B648AB3D6
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xD52D4EDEABABC0EB2DEE3A8774FB57A9
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x5E615D3CF134676DF6481DF9169CD958
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xD6ACD8821D3BBD8F3658AA5F1A59F82D
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x7F712BDC8AD8948593ED029B54B85E1A
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x5082D56EFD6D9AFEA7B284260B7A85B4
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x9A0A95B124C71626E27A3BB31ED7A417
rusty nail."
0x2BCFC0A1009DF58DD07D2582AB4B4893

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0xAEEC9B7DEC6F98D3907D0A3144AF9F58
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x0678EDA15884B04B1A05F6BFE8C6C216

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0xFAE49E6BC477D188FF64AECA422E0A75
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x9C74D91BE2D4E6D9567B577288622152
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0xA8780D5A0D59468D1976EC593B4BEB86

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x6FC30FC1BFD49F70F50A93E9FA184528
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x525CE5655C66C2167F606D3AF26D64EB
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x6D993031294AE0CE6561919DA97EA189
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x48E48E96DED2A381069ED3F478FB98CC
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0xBF1874C7BA764D14370809B9A5DA8B3D
people in one house?"
0x2E63009874C4D16CA38903B105008ABE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x165249E4AD81CE41A2E75003530E4724
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x55440698FB1BDF5FB7434A0D3CE44593

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x108F3169E2CB9C9088F2845F14447F44
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x88C77BC4EFFCD853823AE13B8F2F2814
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x25D66C3BC50DDE0330C3DB83D3C8058F
and experience."
0xF76210E42A030F9D16EA5B558180F71F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0xFCF874680206C49D4C099EFC3597E108
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0xCDFF2B981DF2448AA17879BFBCB5CEFA
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x1794094C45C7D3CB3DE406BBE0C4E36A
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0xBAEABC7E6E28C912654C149DE27470FB
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xA58BB024BB3A5BC48DD199F7AC90189D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0x90DF7DF52E5CACEB7463EBB3DE43F3F9
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0x5BB6457DC2FACFE0275920BA6A08E445

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x7F7780ADA5755E37045B0A394F8079A1
expression; "but speak too."
0x65C8EE6FF4D83ED8F8194A20A9522DF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x55FA5A3D85147F764501AA26ACA1CC3D
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xEB02D17D9B49CA90C202662935843230
their orders."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0x4B399F39A9289D244D2F8D5823C3EEA2
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x922014DDFA28927C8D21146F1D84BA0E
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x09D2EB6B4BE6452B0C8A6A47B62507D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x14036AE937A89D7CFF3A5CD6C242C130
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0xBC983EDAA5B12D261CC1737AD0FC3E25
dependency, I agree heartily."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0xBE9A4BFB7939B69D941A51F760510535
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0xCFDA0273501627573ACB30842D65A344

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0x7C46589EE07CDC66ED2616E9A88D66E9
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0x63C1A0090106275227072B0DD8A7E40E
salary."
0xC9F936ECE4E20D944F984AF787E1A2ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x47EC6C2CB89D9316801CA31B6CBF9107
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0xFC7C3221B313B1FA3B5D6E7C1C4A7E40
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0xD2F91933000FE02ECD3A7F76FB2738B9
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x7523E20C0D470B111A47B6D438613510
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x654A91EEB2D01864FCC2F7687FADC5F0
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x5C8D40D3BDC95D8000F5EE04409193C0
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x72E9A162E0D997599C562F1AC05AE7D9
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0x4E98A0F1F1E251E7BF38922E420CEE73
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0xA6FBC94A9CE6D07238C9D55D41E7A365
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x5B42D04847849E231E3BDB9BE2A7AEBC
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x2C8D9DED648F38252A07A61A24C74A3D
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0xF4D83F1ACA5104B57BEB7154FB8CC706
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x47EAF58D548216CC54BDCF56C6E06F28
defects to counterbalance your few good points."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0xAFBA5ED7AF36BF5BA93D74F3FDE1F3BD
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x11102C9B76D7559893A362DF8D113716
as well as imagined--
0xCD47151172E642797C3C06983F154754

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x7F41A7A1586433537CC0BBF99019D0FF
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0xCA56EB7054664C89DD6E7EA2B0E13D67
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x0D1C09F169A497DA8FB95D4190C0D396
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0xD45E1B55465D0490FDDAD9122D2E7B28
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0x44A48F7F48CA27B8D016498C47C6C52F
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x4F01588FFB2D460EB3889C36FFBFB4FA
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0xD6B4B8C318DB8C4F240AFA4582CE3A63
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x35C4B768A5B1D134863F265FFA82FBB0
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0xFE9D775311C2CA42E61D55C9880A577B
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0xD67E0798BC08095A65C1CAD7FFDCCD71
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x02961C780338A8972DC0789363C8EEAD
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x11241A78E7ED5C5A476B72E9F3B03B11
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x5B149D90DF61B7BFD81C5B862BAA7762

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0xEDC4F6F8907D131FCB1BD76ABD72C4C3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x9DFC59C62EE2BA1453DC80960319022F
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x88E7D6DD71C4266CA4A322E6EEF90848
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x63E0E7A90C9C4C15CC3EE4809338B5D2
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0xC1CC219ECFF4CECE8CF183D28A875238
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xD4F112602E9D61BEEF2DC50CCC63E445
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x6FA9DC7F7C95F754F893FD4A406596BA
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0x3BBB54F8BE1AAF4A7E3D341926E5589D
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x5FB300640F4796DE38DF41BBAC3817A7
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0xA22602FA3E63117A6AC83513FBD3C5B3
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0x58E3F38C340B5C9B6531B38EC4E1079F
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x2483B111923CD7698F316A26299F0CFF
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0x93774B217881CADD15C325E3F6AB0565
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x6A209C52FDA32229718A76242E290E5A
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x94547279765235DC8C261BFC3DC2FD54
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x7A2DE3686033E6AEF3C6CCD01C57D05E
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0xBAE430A4993A2AB32C0368B1D4D7A227
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xA92AB31687A39BBDFC483409BBC41F66
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were

writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x2CB9C87EDB61F21B9E2A220E4E73A89A
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0xB0B4548FA007A3C20448FB6A1036AA81
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x86E9779417C66080FD53D9ABB35CE1E9
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0x3F011533220E23E3F5077C08ABAD73B2
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x40E03F0CA7FF597DD846248E123193B4
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I

wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are

tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."

have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,

hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is

"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x2292A212CE68B92B194828F79C58972F
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0x38EB20ED675B949B50353D678A032259
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x4F00A3941602E8925BF820F708C2EC92
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on

disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my

know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that

you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you

intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems

to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0xDAE7C0E244D3897B6726E58DF1383021
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0x3A72B78DDA08E18070E1BB0AC59B42A1

that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at

The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
0x56CBD71AB8A266193FF6FBF652CC434B
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0x29CDD30A3944261A7318AE8863CDA252
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0x799FB86BD1B8FEFCA442602F2AE97499

watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious

frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her

out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in

miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the

0x96A2B3EF95B4E51D1B398BF2B78DD432
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it

will be realised."

Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She

entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0xDE543B9BF30E432F3B515C8F6A339D1A
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0xD71E06152693314F0DC8B083A2615301
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0xD3D71E24A489CE18DCBB52D5866A97C3
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0x400CABD9DC0301736B8B99B0E9880F4E
and small white satin sandals.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes

souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"

And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x65F41FAA719A49CFAB41219344008507
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x940F602FAEDAEFEE84E72A3CD8E8AC13
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she

added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"

gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss

Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x41DE146F137CD8DE595FA196A7406C84
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0xC81FFC16F00511241CA08A9DFFA8768F
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not

valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x8DFDD8FD78929C4093134BEB8663E822
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the

blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xAB8DB21374288B2F86AF941EEE42C27C
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x89A73E09D655A05B6299DB5C063AF315
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.

Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x5B2B4367B13D84884B9DC7B661FF23B4
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while

she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xD681DE0A4708A25FAD59CBE68A1D3E78
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0xA785F922E1713F6D428960ABD84242C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0xD59B1533C50FFC1C55BFB491878EDD5B
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x16ED913F8EEFD3103F6DAD1D48652489
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x87C2013DF34C7F39BAFE114895BF47D8
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x16384C90B5BCEC06BFCF97953561FEC1
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x7CEC93C35DA0749B2A1083A9E34B3066
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0xCBB92877BB36BB4E895D4D9AD1DABA05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x1EDDBC81FE7612EA85545E2303C455DE
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0xDFC18D035C0832860DE3F7AC8DF3D0F4
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xEE43C3E641BA85A40EB9C01E6A27302D
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x99C96FE4FA0EC63EFD70A912A1FD2782
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x826C8DCCE38D8C4A94C0E791BA2017D5
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0xAFB1FFC06C7FF9F4C727B0586FDCBC1C
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x8A83973FEE811C0EFF0615A0F0D731D7
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xBE7E0D7C9D6C6AF8604DEF08B13551F7
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x3F3BE8C6974EAC517881F772636FCAB1
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xFC1EE769A7B6286A5C0C8C2E708779FB
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x704665FFFAD48DB19EF84FD52C8276C7
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0xDF4F25FACDB7BED890695D6461316A8E
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x021097D5643C4BED11B936CD6C54ED12
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x558CCD1548BA87FE16BD26D55026643A
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0xFBDC329989D7E7EFCDA95C8444414485
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0xD55A462E7DC0F9644A22C89F60C61E80
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x7CABFDE2B24A31099967C117882A0432
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xB748B0B45927D7CC69AED8C1BDD14F05
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x156F4BD09ED2C5FC1EDCFE503F5CFE70
now, if you will excuse me."
0x77F094D6D70697F332809B9DE8AD5BB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0xC9E374ADEC14FA7EE1BE0701C001C0DD
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x221F44481DE9CFAEFF2BFF195FBD894A
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x78E3D9380BA41370434FAA9817B92398

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0xB8DBBCF34BE3597B7A24265A425B3183
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x16D4010FA9F38792D66E94A454E5B02B
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x14EECA757D90CED03E6277A0D2D67D2C
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x0DA5CCEC62BA6230826DD8DAA635BF53
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xD363A800CBACD287155E5239D950B102
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xDCC51C1226F935E34B71DE3CBF96ACB6
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x77707F3BD1BFBB678A15BE2DF4BF9BE9
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xB231F9DB90920389A5036AD1CD789069
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x6623AB85A294D0BB4E408F4320FE3BA9
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xC8E94D9C097132F23210E9081A6417A9
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x7BB6A602C8C6699730258CD855139FAA
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x92C5069691A0EC39FCCF9B1FF05A8091
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x429706F072D666B22640BFFF56827A4F
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x6D3106591CC9B252CA4CC1B3E2483A64
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x951DB0B8B39D447D54FE711FBE0B878A
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xA5855ABE07D3E1F28381EF459679FDD3
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0xA00F1EBCA98F0085B4FBD75914D16BE8
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x50B6532470A857A483C9E0909EEA0559

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x18DBB914D81FB44B81CF5DB2911C6837
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x39E5BB0D727AEE15AD1B06D45BDE1CA5
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0x92F0124DDCAAF6A5EC111FCEC7C2E31F
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0xBEBAB19A33DFCD647018A35D6BABBAEF
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xEF7EB3A269195DC68E1A74BAE07BC4A9
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x49343C21B6913A7DDE1670AD10565D14
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x6E0E7D60634BDFC7A3F07F5EF509E23E
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x2EDD93D50095F9A06A7D8E852FC7D435
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x23C3D6740114D3DF79E4AC7263A3C423
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xA063C8224BE2356D9159E5EB9C86BB05
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0xEE5F1F81A215FCBC17BE139408947D2B
current--as I am now.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x3C469823DD01A8BCBC1994E74BEC3058
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0x1E681B3A675B4298DB6BB9669ABB7EFE
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x9CE2DC3442ECC71A8446591BDE005631
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0xD1E967A09BC46C134B1B13F7E9D857D7
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x56742E1938F14A0612234258C1CEB1BC
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xED71DB48624A7480758C62CED05FB1C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0xAD65DEFB83547B1C4B91D75DE4C8C298
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x984D2E438FB4023C59A491CC89BB56DA
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0x419B39E9FB4E4E533AB2C4CA4A64ADBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x3C2B7C8C86F6C0A175B89CB8D5646F2A
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x3F662B97C91171A4D27567A554E7E4B8
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x6B50D65F597D8EFCF5ACEED71D145546
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0xF0770A5F289CD836522785B09A37B0E3
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0xED433954746A819E08FE3B5469E09890
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0xBE55CA8230CB59141A5AEAA322EA5CC1
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0x3183D46A27FD397597D055B85D37CA99
his countenance: he went on--
0xABDB9BA9C26813D6AE018EC3D6226812

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x026AC048BD2FA1BBD55698280FB4ECFD
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x044B2B678C66C913167107E32847E937
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x83E30385546C2F2BC84D5C48FB3F373D
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x60D3C989AD2137366BA43FF66ECC44F6
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x1CCDEEEB89EFBB92B66D0D90A1FE1CE6
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x9D39C9C95E90AF7CA06CF8B126F62EFF
if you dare!'

"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x3EF98C21E0158874C324E86E211E6EBD
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x5F62F900D6C9A527C48244E2B9C8EA3D
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0xBC5B82383CFA732365D106D40C7A22C8
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x58BD9A379956D58FCA0EF7523F2CFABD
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0x89950FDA4D12E6E572867CA816B1F20A
but straw and rotten wood."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x63A9E2253E05D1218971F12477C5FEA7
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x7F63CFAB1777E353A616FC8B43B4352D
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x804FBC951779C1F55BE5BC8DBC05A3B5
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x37111E2C1BC2A651FD2166D2B94EF872

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0xE32F185CBC42CFF351CEAC5979F3778A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x072DC584442F1A578586DA40FA2283DA
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x3C5A3DFF66F3AD276F5366C5623416FC
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0x1D40CFE14108B2A7391A3E54BC30FDE7
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xD6A08007911994538EAD9FA52F7DAAB2
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x97863B38280DE4E4ECD65AF8388FBF97
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x3D0A016871F9274B007BEA663DB6E194
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0xDC8D0F2B9AD697A27E7A0F9390E5EE98
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x04435B1F398F27249CD758A6FC09130D
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x0C892899AC257C5519575C28E304521D
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xBEF7ECED1165247724F9F90E9B721679
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x5899EEA08DD8E10CCCABECF55253CDEC
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x487DE6F8457584E1E69EC9D4AA15CD84
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x7625D5483B0EC13F3198E4A98A036B47
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xC560F90AB91B2B95354F98F717486A5B
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x4F2D98DCA17C73F79DD28E25FC2ACFB8
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x8F5766973D9AE36F9B60C532FD09E8E1
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0xB136BB4EF93DA42A2B0DFBE7E9C6E7CC
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x421E198AE6186EF39790F20BF932E3FB
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x3C2138027C813FF20DFD263D27E1046C
After this digression he proceeded--
0xE21914428FCA09533A1AA7722AE4A3F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x3B38230FF9D3046042DBE5ADE175EEF7
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x811F9347A7CAA3BE24E2063F2C704CB0
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x9C45F1E62C92BB77BAAB8AE881D8533C
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x5690C1850AADBCD7EFF38ACE9D11663F
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x4DE31B854A909E0B85BFDF610D479C8A
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x76E268CAC8DE03426BEB2BAF709387F4
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x44D1AF8D71C8E9BDF056BBDA33CA1146
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x1A5F86E26154378E642ADAE59B39DC9A
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x3A39992A4DCB5C8D377CAA6BCDDA818F
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x95CA8DEA426CF255731ACC13D7B9E9EC
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0xE8ABBB4C0227A79F88A9094F04FB5094
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0x078AB336A772A84D6784ADE63F4D450A
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x7A743F4573DA66E4FF3ACF8A80138328
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0xE0F079054A6FF4A63792F6E178A4F84C
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0x4489A9045025A6DD53C78934617CA528
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x48D7ECBA5D0052CDA21C67728C303098
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xE718032A8B64D47AC6740C9CCA0853B2
who had been her dupe.
0xFC42891B6F6673E3EFB008192B2D1348

"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0x2D35B336080931D503EED69EBAB029AC
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0xD31DE871EBA1A4EEDDEBC1BD5386295C
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x4AA4C73A6A08F665660998361160E32B
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x07163C30B9A99FD503B1796766AD2C91
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xD8DD2088DB73AB0D80F95D34654ACA1B
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xDB30152A63B23062F9A92C946DBEB9AE
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0xAF074EFDEDE9C9CC2D3FE0D6F46E8C88
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xD1A66B3A1EAD71E39256F7565A1B29FF
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x91FC2B5901A3727EF6C48B6124021646
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think

me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon

them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0xE8C3CA7D9CD94718372FEB96B8A0134A
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0xF4EE95E039FCDB1FAABA205CBF12B824
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xEB58A9135CD270CEB296DD44F95ACC3E
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xA0397E59F1619ACA91E9FF7581E1E557
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x2240AFFE7715B4E8A24C38332F8161F9
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0xAB3EEFED65EF529D2956F688880E6F36
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xD6745518752EFE908D8D48A05672E264
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x2EF74A9347639731A95F1E7FDAD6B322
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xBB33FDC4256911039834E0DF276FCCF7
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xB89367038724F0A651F74078EEDD492C
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0xC45B20545C068E5B8F7F7C4C5F7D4F30
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0xC4466F7C2064E7FB0C817D88BF6F8655
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x529B4AF1881688F506A2144A5AC57B35
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x99B3783F0146576212E5AFAA124BE434
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x4F95DF1FA864E5758E740A94F39848CA
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x22C77B86FD71BF3A23BA86C0A1F0696F
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xF53566675782FC0409E2A76BED1FDA42
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xC20929B67C366B66F53D2BB4FAEEA3D1
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x25AE7C4386C712F9D8CA04EEEB087D6C
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x480CE7FB5B4FF18EA6D616D3BC5632F9
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x5693B2D887E6FE0FE5755049368684CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x06C942F5D61BFAB883BC7F65B0295CE7
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xE6BB9617356F11D335C8C717341E2243
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0xD4AEA34B60564F9E9B675E2D04960903
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xDA897981F461C71926B68E1EBC863885
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x93076891B5E2FE8286C2B2AED5983000
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0xB506FB2745B623F459F1C965860FE73E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x511D1386248903BDA5A17F3CB779E756
you too: it darkens."
0x57F23C60F8E96B3BB925558D878DE614

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xA36D5443B6C0AE1121079D7528074A24
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x34A403B36D06D453BC18E4CA62D7FC49
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x1E44849ADD1E86EE4AC130E828D52F2C
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x927EA98326D05C992322F382F114FAA6
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x590F1AC3709310EFF86B0ED9E6F360B9
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x5804FEFB0C2AD273285D5ECAEA2DD02F
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x84FD087AB2122A9176BC7ACFBE8CB4A8
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x552D23444392A82A9DAB4E9A8308B6B1
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xC8433D70C3F263B0A8343040B3352122
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x26AE817252B4AEAED01B790A9FCF611A
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x6452A3DF706A1ADE32B9837CFCC57DFE
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xCEC014ECAE014B2F5ED915146D252FDE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x6B8BC3ACDE48A681E8A9E9AF0574FFD1
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x10DA4323B064DCA2C44C83136487D7FD
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x146263C387D83428A81EA4E5BC3DF6A7
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0xA4E189A286FF0023D684C4DB4109CE34
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0xF828121BDE30A1235F45E835BBD0F024
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x26508BA627153BA6B038ECD9D708A481
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0xD7062C1756602EFD600AC80912B3F432
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0xEECE1282AB24EE81129AAD56957F7E5A
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x0EED8DF7BAE59130B22391141EF8263A
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x234659DBBE1993CA41AACAF6FA2B4B92
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x6A9C34C5B6B352F3D616F658693E51D3
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x25A870BAE446FBF536778D35C4C7B5F4
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0x3EEA4F2D8A5C3FD82B234C8BEEEA710D
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x27225111F7BA5BEF92AAE91E1BBE7786
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x1C72DD96713B1D15A8E8DE0A696E2926
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0xFB6DBE0AD0DD3819ABD9037C7F78245B
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x296361A6667BF51A207BAAF9D90333A4
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x63F01A6D67D2BAA453008B9513064D66
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x3314AF8186EF8AC44743DF6D99070AB0
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x79A9859B941303D45C5DE129C0D02350
benefit.
0x30D3F969DC2E8570C83CF3D896409F8B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x8F2830F66C19C40AA809BAADAB0CF666
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x88CBC566A3786C2E21498EBF81F084ED
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x7EE661B142614673F197292AF66B52D9
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xA3EE393E1C8BABC7732A4AB56B94BC47
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x8C9F9522DD30F70E2DED86C29E52FC1F
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xB1381D154A9ACCEF40F097D6FF98D562
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x6F6192C53F029A1CE0B4C7428E89CE95
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x7B09C6829B9B8366EF70CC4453F7D3C3
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xA859CDEC97CC1359B25DC410A06878DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0xFD4C2F5E5B7ADD846365777568B72C3C
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x781C34B22DBB25C147338E8AC9C200A4
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x9E7881D2C44A419F37B646460FAB728E
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xB560393387A79BB435E4DAA10757A9B0
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x43883D32EB285DB12984F9E72C6947CC
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x8BE9D3BF65B7191B70F15ADD2EEADBC2
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0x1BE4134AF0A97FBF401042A5BFC002BF
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x3B214FAEA19F157147B37B853675995D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x54859324E9D3E6C556790075049BBACD
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x09D1DB9CB4340EF7AEA8BF07BDC1A820
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xEF14887F66FEDC7905327C2294A918A3
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x2E08929C8FAA45430583738AD1569B32
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0x07462AF48C62CE8C73668C43FF56458C
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x4EA12237DFBE37C0A8D644AC70FBDDED
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xD3F55761F705F72328476C4030BF68C9
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xC28992C040F124901234AAA371FE4683
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xEA858336E15666549B4AFCC17BF7061C
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0xE140A3B116142EFB2D394494340556CA
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x0CA8F4115382CF6DDA1E541C860F80B7
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x4A0CF8EEF5849A88E8B8C606EB45FEBD
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x0F262EDE019DDD9CBC47FC8EFE0A353A
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x56CC2BB11BB61CC738B7DAC75DF8705C
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x7DE5139DBA66F6623996684B730D068B
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0x36A706FC686761A68ACBD9DBCD45088E
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x73EC197562DC5728E5CB00132992C84D
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x4D2050FE7FE06998C6C11A4EC18F6814
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x88F5E372B761088EE30C16DAB669DC26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x72C5FCE77FC0BD9A7D93EAA59CCD5FE6
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x94486B8B863A9ABDFA16285BEE2A508A
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x8FC1DF7DA1E425B304CEEE6E668870D1
Thornfield.
0x3260BC2892F0CA88A3327785EA8B3C7A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x429C8D9EB984C7D8FF37574901824DED
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x3076ABD4E7F57F00E45AD4C2848AAF48
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x91D4DFBB4F9B026B762E66538716CDEB
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x0CEC60CB443515309FB7A4D266F2F925
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x330E0A23AA884F2E55A2DB32DBAA086C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x1C4E9A846171E4FC3A680329F866DBF6
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x5CEB30EE2C7AF708BC2D14835D0EFEA4
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x21B892449296D7791ADEC9C9F9ED4220
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0xE957183C950BFB61DC194B63E6C8252E
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0xE0D4CE58BEFD72494EFF3369C2C147B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x5B8AAF6D8F7B9E00D8FB5D0FC40FA56B
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x06FE10D89CC19E1034A79C0B3C9A6709
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x4EE93865A86BB5486F1CD9642417A354
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0xAAAF34AB6DE81E9201FC2EAC15CCE247
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0xE65DF5A6F6CF9A1CA5B0DD4E9932D12F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xC0B783A376E18BF6F704DD01D1AA00A5
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x120532E8D2750FF51A6F4A9A279A02D0
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x09096230C53F0E57A9138339A27A4CBA
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x219BDCFABCE0B223B6C57FFF56B49D09
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xE9A23D198747EBF23CD998D90F619315
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x8BA2370446CDEB4453F0737E93817E1E
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0x589292CC12DD05133BC96A2D9C5EB38B
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x31E0E73FCE58B1845C5E6734335303D6
enough.
0x69686774AC203FD33F9AA105505DA558

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x6B5B4152669C25B19AA36A48220A2FB5
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x116C764AA9A8FD22EAB04E4103543398
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0xCF78D4E15B7F158EA1C671621CBC1BDE
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0xE99CA435D72D1D84BE3E230449A01EFF
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0x69F8F7D8ADBD4765126CD72A3A52BD33
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0x47BAB872E21A69FD41E19B1CA704832D
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xC506C0FBD634079CD8B7FEAAFE316BA3
there?"
0x24DE67F18AED0BD0110FF705FA6B11D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x29973DE5A6F64902BC229F66D399EDB1
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x0098E370F94B3A2F553006F7C73ECF67
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x93592817CF913223BDDCC27DE29DF9A5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x441AE84C0C6B8D4FC6FA723C2B9CB779
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xEAAF2E9FCE60B879EF9D8BA3F68EA15E
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x1FB496AE7DA484811923C35C3817B9B5
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x778EA16932462AFD033EFD3599ED007D
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0xEF9D4E816148321315E43D71D999CD3D
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0x1B8E1B90403CE85C855DE5E1BF8218A3
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xCE7D7307582E848F24C92F13D4FAC420
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x8A16EF7225D30B9791624E15614E82A3
burning.
0x986B6072E84260F5ABA6682740D087F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x740822A900843DD7AB65B58A173F8882
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x76FBDF79F5FB448B1832D5351FD9D63D
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0xAAC1266F309663E4DBFE7F37EF863750
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x08368A28654AFC3BC2F6BC3668A3AF14
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0xC0D630EC212BFAA12B7D1B78E91EDB55
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x4EAE07FC5E20EEA3C34199FF9DD79B54

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x8A99032E33ADDFF58890D7B187BC178C
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x23CAE0CA1693CC3DCFCA80D05DD67E6B
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0x0F8E4E0FE95A897055B64DAFC1ED8AAD
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x53CE21DC7E25CF0BE16B7B9DF9C7C10B
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0xD70CEBD847CED000BE8119FBD7ABAC0B
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x37ED937FAA33614F4506E4E8E2928650
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0xDD0723266CA2B2E3B5C54EF30959E494

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x641567FA1459FCFEDFDB47E357DBE337
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xBB57E5D485B46085DCEE7C570C904EB6
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0x1049C9EB4A63B7441557FDE9335BD882
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xD03C39B74164893E2DDDBD3E10E6186B
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xC247F6A2BFC4F1E6563B379EFA5A1C77
water.
0xC12C511302D38E5D3CB7AF83F63CD7CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0xFCA124DFB7B541E873779029B08BA090

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x9F5F2C9354D86170BD586F745D0B2B6C
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x952138770C9120DAFDB11AA68D51ED85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x7240DCC49007D7F1BD6A608BA38CFBE5
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x0DB5B486D2261BE1F01ADD2A977F7FD5
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x7657AB57A597DB6C630B5ED55CDDF755

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x38AFC78C4C09CFCBA9D634243771537C
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0xE39CF611F46B4AD36F120A6E40E1273F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x30B43D5F2F950F47C42C85F80CC5DAD6
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x5FF9A73657EDDC0A018B8E4B2B9845DD
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x8AEB2B1F118D72FACF826D586EDAA147

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0xA09DE30B3A6DEBC43D9922C5A9558213
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x017F93B225608F3010F330FFAA08631C
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0x440B528731A2B4AE231C73F394F054BA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x470DAD307B1F77EC336949C742E42651
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0xF670FC7EE297A82961198E828551C114
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x6E5399E2265852B086F1AF764921EC67
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0xDBF1189C7ABDCAFF3C250AEB520B6199
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0x22D96101A8CE47454391C946EA636674

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0x74149706CA382B3A1CA0678594BC5B04

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x4942CCB91DBD2E7529C4D4C13EBC34A6
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x88EC0A4D525E34F0C4B6749F07E89821

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0xC1E0F25025DFF0EE3175E53D67A2F846

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xDBFAE974DF49A8E0FFD0EAA2E8FA4743
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x1F3E9B64E45160B9FF1D0077B920FBB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xEBC60A4FE35EDDF28BD0557D3E34377E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xA1823717BFFC7B18A1918F418A085B15
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0xC83008130EC28344FE51E2C25A80B36C
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x14D2992C8C368059D1922A891D473E52
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xF497C8F9D40A04543A0114B8ECC596B7
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x4335E12DA2D915EA94A449F92846D6CD
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0xF9391FD483FEE809F7EB3416BBE9C0AF
move, remember, or call any one."
0xD664F491C1F8A0421E3D19FEBAACE4F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0x81AB370D99C5FD5B1C0E638E61FDB84C
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0xC72A74A187FB187C0403966E81E191E2
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0x68294B5D69929E290BC58D6C84828E6B
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x89360E13FB58BE2DB6AB170F35C313B5
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0xDC13B618E639D0CEEBEF0F3137F91E02
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0xFF2B3ABA596A180F76B92E8120AD12DE
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xB7638BA7F8B5E62B73F2FAB3BA5AC696
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x67F452F10237125F72F9C497BFBA0976
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x6071AAD60B8B52A1DD07E5AC2B591433
"and not something worse."
0x601552854B6786A84A2FB65B38EBE7D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x43C7A59C9A729ECFF88C5172317F248F
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0xE8449B0779A41ED82CBD08A488C57BEF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How, sir?"
0xFC34FBFCD6BD05BF5B905AE77F3B71E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x7941EF69F55DB7B251FBA5B734C304C8
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xE1CACD39668CA2C2FA24ED00F8FC4A0A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xD5D083D8F06A987247E74F817825CE39
door."
0x523586C8146DB37DA17BA16BD5A539E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x10EF5912CB858500B44BC37FE1C243E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xCC2252838596EAC24B6270BE44CE4FA1
think, or something like it?"
0x6F869E788E67ACA6E83FE87B58FF679D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x5496F33D10942E84EF57EC8DE340A04F
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x75D2DDD6F82335270784F4C353CA3A8C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x2D50470CE044ECBC55A2BEB260099B84
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xDF1073ABD30791B8C8D9B637E006BDAB
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0xF63B3A5A8B19082A34C7583CEA78C701
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x0EE06ED817AC5C03262CADE57D529211
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x27AFDA979B31846C30DDD759084178E1
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0xF0CA28AEC66F4F281C0D2ED0DE031C07
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x25FDDC65E3289CCCF62D179DD5A0B476
hours the servants will be up."
0x00103ED2A04DEF4DFCB7E947B1D3E1AA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x9FDDA19F81CEA01E661084879B20278F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xFDABB60B9DEFF71E788FB4D65A23F1CE
go.
0xE035A0F06B2E31A045EB73F434B93AA5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xE2296D86019655C0690E1C43AEAF08F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You said I might go, sir."
0x0DC85A4E2982B640B72F43AB9BFBAE75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x0CDD97FD4DCAAC8C067175EC2C405358
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x71E1BC3A9280EC601FD540BB6D101957
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xEBE3E8AFEF6CDB9A4877F0C0ADB2A5F6
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xD5DC3EB227054BB3E38B0B93979787CA
At least shake hands."
0x36D63E0B93A1EFA094410E7B960DEB2C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xEA4C57D070BF92BD2C05620FEAD37415
both his own.
0x715CFA01CF1D525E5A08FE58DBAF6629

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x5333EA2107BE5E16FA8DB8840D048401
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0xE82AE36CAD4308F6B46A360A5265D168
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x89C0C3823A7204C3BC7E22358604A3B0
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x4FAA3C4AB0BCC6366204AE8E6F1260DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x108B76F1CFAE4019FE5272B17997F94D
his voice was checked.
0x467AD4F12CFD4EA9E957AA8A36B54ACD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x7BEE562F62993EF128F88BA1B5D0FE4A
in the case."
0xF170822F03508023295BA00FBAD319C9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xA2B5FB5F5795424435A3C62A8EC34760
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xA512E6F16B76B51C21208CCF035A1956
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0x3BA6ECDD2B81DE61EC73B033AF6EC6A8
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0x3E4173FDB5BF99EEF3410A40453EEA98
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x95269E5F693B24BD2F01C9458D0FFABE
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x56A3DE47792818D2C747493DAC9D9AB1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x2F86A3C581FBF707748D732F3423BB1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x0DAA94CEC70D514A4A54533876A429A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x8F716E841D4DAC037D56C86E9B1C6F5F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am cold, sir."
0x00F261B49142C0086F38D8CBFD7C54C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x6301BE1A92DCECD6D2755FAB6968AD91
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xF895D0E1194C7E7AA4B54F1FE3BD0F78
expedient.
0xFEC466A9D182EBDCBBB9973A8D32C537

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0xDBC9E8926C638B9CCF0EDB953EC5BC6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x0EA72F5C9FC94C9426ED7DDA6CF29AB5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x6211F8F0B0F270D4E259AB4112E7C53E
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x2B836013097EADBAA78A162175956574
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xE0F81816B1D304B1512157E4AB4E5DDF
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x90DCCC493297507839D5F3024610AABB
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xB372E5AF20A8D68CE8B9BB57DEECA0B8
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x02877BC79865E2A40BCEDF0D8B4EBB5F
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x29AB1B2B7EF813B6B7AE3FB10669D211
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x47559ADA1BC73F864E8386B7B767C82A

CHAPTER XVI
0x0963D1121412373B18B50122A98F1973

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x09B107DCF99D83EDFD126C83D83EDEAC
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xF74D222E7BD15E9A4BE620D4DFFD0D58
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0xCA55B3FEB46FC676636675698EB5ACAD
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x1E65526F71FB9D270FD3607AA394F7E4
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xD54C688C0CE8C9D967786893A1DC211E
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x7FC36E01904C7FC6A387D5E244A69C66

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x6F87632AD2168D8D20DC2CD02B5AA519
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xE96BE4B52033CF5766E67B548C8D6B5E
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x80CD829CEFF64048F7226EB674E10683
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x7BD89479A19762AFA7AF2FF5F8E7DE34
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xB063FFFD3ADFE80CD2CA640E3CA34980
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0xE9069DCC0A8900797933DF3D78C424D3
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0x7C675AF9B8554C336AB590FF0C64551B
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0x37F6B5A7439C08A92F94387B542D7E95
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x3C4F280A8CE034F1A5670476DC7BA1C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xAC1C7A8FBBC39BC8E6C893707386F77A
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xF158306B0C854FC880332E0447D76857
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xF73DB99AA8DBEDB66E5BE5CCFDABB423
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0x6E173B7CBEE17969C9B5A1AB138D43F7
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x46937F024B1AA4E90A8C0382D2F9BC4E
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xF78C884FB11447DEC4B380F933155450
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x4E12522B7745760A47E270B16E6C4F59
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0xFB329E8981B0B91369B2E4CC44114E94
no other than Grace Poole.
0xA434B1DC044E120F41CEC1D8BED459D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x0E5E5269D6547606D6ED4A37E1442D39
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x4480B6F98F9EF423935EE8733EB0C737
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x6C45E423C32DF7E9CC247D644DE184D3
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xEF1D86DDFEA731DDB8C067EF10E3AD48
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x3C6E556FFC7C0ED9850C6047071B3EEA
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0xF6338CC84467D105FAD1D45F85739A8B
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xCBE483005222F4C774F73913EED11BA3
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0xEB6DA22B1FCAA075168CA2B3F6FFF6F6
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0xED6F64B39E51AA56444F2547548E9F14
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x20FC574BAB74C15FA4B60558962886CC
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0xB44F27097BF8006352C2E931D6511FFF
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xFA7665BEDDC855CA2632BF0C3217EC7E
went on with her sewing.
0x9E3F0C64EE88CFCFB0639B5948E8EB03

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0xD945CCF58D3DA2BA087ACFA939CC29B8
is past comprehension."
0x9F724EF439F5D8477D0F1FE8A02B03EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0xBC43ABE512D8CED4F8EDA73A18B947EA
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0xEBA28961AD3B48F106782604E91C2513

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0x917240EC9090EAFEADDC07A6FF35D532
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0x103AE0AD41CAF1470E8E314579EBA62E
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xE70E0D7D178C749CFDFE53D78B9CC3C0
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0xE2E7C1C227027558E250D6EC0DF66550

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0xDBDDFEE21C9357C946DF1A662EC941D3
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x0E81A8A53B0CFDE39342724D2AB044B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x075B491F9D9DE1E2A239677701BB3919
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x753146BAF213EB93ADB55361726F30CD
she answered--
0x1442EFD78118E3E44FB500CFFAF6D476

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x184F79CA46F51B3122A29908FE42AEF9
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xCA967726CD1A14E83E007B4DCA4F7EBB
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x440DF183A8C47DDBFA54A0F67C2495BA
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x8DD33BF2D15EDA0192C90232841CFBA1
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x7459B864CCEDA5B5319A3CDBBB9032D1
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x91B024B424E9EB017AAB25B285340B0F
a noise?"
0xC8B5C76F910CB3B34D6066F0A5E9A08A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x5A6CF735C66203AF717604DD3444AFCD
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xAC5AB4336DC651CA71271677F6610A05
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x1BEAD8401FDDDE18BED9233DA735FBE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x722F622E32E51E9CEE28DD06316412A6
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0xB55BEE19EA0F92C3F3E9923BE326B861

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x009D41EF87DD21752148CEFA6400350C
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0xB4A0A9EF2CA0F4DA664736B210567154

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x68154E3C4CE65F76723499314111AD77
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0xAACF2EF31D567187419C3809DEF60DAC
conscious eye.
0x3A8781890C5205A1DACE6F6C280C7E9F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xC1B4E7B5DD68D04F12EC384804B16057

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xC46E8B1106ADAD03CA0930A69EA0AC9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x51890B8AE821C358EB7293B8BB96674F
gallery?" she further asked.
0x0D4A272004FC61E9043AC83ABF83CB42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x74FF1A69CB467892CFB70228DA302A26
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0xEDEE277E68D9D318992D7378117F1E3F
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x1A4934DA9EAEE1BF37187CF25E290996
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xA49121AC069054359EAD6BDB051D8C8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0x1F07F34524A053627B3448EBAFC19E5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x5909D332509AAA522263571D3262777C
you get into bed?"
0x25F03E575F1FE15171FB4441239037A5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x475903E87D3859A1DCF410D963FDF83D
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x6DF727C6E3FC5C0D14317009715492B5
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x30EE1C51ACC4E2D6C889C1D58133FA52
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0xCD46F278E628439266A7817B5CF9E6DE
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x6A298A3D0C3A1F44154515CCE0A91407
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x922989344DD1E3F34FEBC63E1DCC2F71
lie down."
0xB3ABE70046989A4D98E82F7A8BA0C356

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x26CB5387E183D9B90997D0013BBF6F92
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xED17317F12113C18B71651A8D9C7202D
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x15FBF6E005B2F3F41E385E17BC43E156
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x1FEAFD81D15FBF8BFD3C3EFAAE7F2135
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x59C31885EA5BE5BCFCF91D6DB2F8B85D
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x7A883C1D8B7D0EBAE40C4139FFEDB514
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x077593317B36719D5E531F9A663CD7B6
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x5E929367796B094EFEDA7F92E02503B1
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x22D2DC22C8C913914D2B5C2AEF00C8EC
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0x6B31EC3E515C4D30C3FED972BE708996
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x1D0B8F9CA407BA0A6F3BF6AF908FAD7C
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x3AB0302D41C3142BF52C47D56831FC8F
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x0699DE95DD3593CD647BB8CAD50296D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0xEAA69EDA971318AE52F37D4D4F417114
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x262F4ADA6AD61D8613578E92BFB72BE7
entered.
0x6B25796776D785EFD82A834447FC5985

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x7718B7B843F56AAF425D708F8B824A5F
be ready: will you come down?"
0x1307D88EA9740EDC7A1866A0BDCAD23E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x5AD9CC1A3575DB9699B9E3F503E0C693
carry it upstairs."
0x654B3E94C1862727612EAA7A03267296

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You'll have some meat?"
0x44EE053858CE54084A64F2657FB7D5CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x34A8A7D81330A30D2ED26E9DABFE45A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the sago?"
0x544BD6A19EB484466B5E128B4650B8B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x3D7A23A7042BE7080EE54B851AC3635C
make it myself."
0xF8EF5308642DB1A992182ADD630599A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0xB139F66A7B89B8BFBF35BDF890C7A87F
so I departed.
0x6CD6CE0C844EB0BCDC9C3CA6EDD10C3D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0xDCC263C5B14DBCB36511E4C3A12A60D0
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x8447D52EF8708D094E0DAC6E218762D0
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0xC75B1F2799D1C1B43F51AE75ABCA299D
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0xDE0CCEA5A57DED3C835F57AA7F2BB6C1
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0xA5B4BD58A64D06F73D3506A8AC544D9F
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0x8E9536AAD8D7089E125006DD561D29A8
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0xD5263B90D77E1A24273F2DEF3E1794F9
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x282296033B0BB177581EB81CC0441F89
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x321C91B51448A2CA279BA6391582BB85
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xCBB656363CC7ADDF686A2462DFFB15E5
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x48DA597A4F5E85A850452D57B0235CC8
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x80801687EEE17296A08C590F4599E802

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x744B2E2A27409E642BAC00E458BBD9E6
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0xEE3EAF6023A48B38C7ADC9BE0EC4A54A
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0x33994564BBD0837F1D16ED78B1E620AC
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x2BFB66C0CAABFD4210A34CB3CE3DE94C
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x88AE72A8124C93FB17EB04055412E7D4
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x47EAFCC7B3520285DE1D504CCAB64A05
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x18D8F792A19485523CF4C0788EB59254
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0x7CC56B9884757C54E0A2D6CAB6159AF4
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x689DBA567FE4C48D667269340A3C66BA
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x293BED08B5EFA82425B7B1744AC07A0B
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0x3068EA10D81DB7FC8BEE03C72BF67D32
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x0C894E20A304E17EDBBF8172CBFECFEE
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xFC4F2F688D6CFAC9C2181465EE0B4F35
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x61F13B2D4682E5B8B8B2687377863462
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x64E1449DAE6594D762DD034A73E27115
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x82DCACC4660CC29481F089C261846D91
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x08454881E23085534C8D76D4DCBCF751
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x8B7F59F8C38B26A43EE6C1A0339E6D8B
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x32C8846D3F5C0BE7C283AD6A47738085
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xAAD906E9D77A49E6039F83822AD18D67

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x63DB0EDDB2CD9F00ED071AAF69E57150
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0xB9B9C2296C951D0DC429B59DC9B2FA44
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0xE748B49CA42322FE618E8B22295F62D1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la

feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xAE4376689477D25E87A6D4AD64DD9BAE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0x83912261B0C088E7BF54B5DDFFFB70E3
thinking.
0xE05F621325F7D5165A2C77EB4E4A8828

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x26CF4E43C402E1AF4D313DF20135AE79
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0x77B47AA29592CA888EE14ED79CD34FED
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0xEB120552CD618456B53AF4498BDF00BB
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xF875AA7A5BD601CEDB405BB8BFFD23FF
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x96CACA843D2B20CA628E974FFC16D829
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xAAC112D923DA480F161D7B128F870D92

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xC97BBC9CBC240C5BEF4A2A758D95E635
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x2CF5424A1EBE1CE711AAB72CB778E061
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xA8C3D3F18E566373A278697D56214345
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x0D5CECBE0FAE63043B9D346BCDE0FB11
impatient."
0x567E4AC65BC3F9DB89AB59D0C6703A89

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x4C5C8EEA7B608BBF9EDCB2C086E664ED
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x01BBC54FF9470742B65463230E5D2985
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x16CF38D28CA4476AB0A518D0C97F4F17
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0xB1E5A12C5406F4F7FB9698AAB1B683B0
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0xE1E6829446E051129AE5EA47F91D9644
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x98D4D730698E705FC5AB73289A97D7F1
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0xA6CB93D6E1375F3ED006A7747DE2D837
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0xB72BC4DD7EE1154795E85A4334487273
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x7194AA7D618DBB206F57DD195C86FF50
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x93A3BDF8B3AD3160D6D29B99D5947B51
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0xA81EA838800BDB21904D30E9D9D123B7
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x9A31FA8F0237AFAA312C20BDB85481C0
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0xA09220C4A303C78A1723054DF292930F
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0xEB94EDDEAA78FC8E53EC6619BDFBF128
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xBFE6F516DB19E4A1C71CF5996588D49E
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xE9D15B6A53D9B59FC678A853DAFB2430
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x0E703C8BDB56CED806FAB036A68AA307
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0xA7EB4E69E1C1A53B2CEACBBEC87B4FA8
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0xF8677A85941E2E376992BB12758F6EE3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0xF9689583F5ECAB4BD95997FFF3E8ACEB
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x5AFF0404C0B0AE71068BC4E64F842142
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0xB541FE7E20FFB57F2A0BC453FFCE45A1
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x92EF8A242B58BEF7DC46602775ED2318

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0xC1E2D4199E9583DC304283D77DA307EB
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xDD86DB7D53334318D1F10AAC51C4EF87
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0xE9B4A6030F3B1123FA113B53D57F72C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0xDE6D452261EF09677552BCF4C0E8682B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x7EA48FED8845193473879BB1B54A331D
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0xB12B0702539D2FD2CB415CEF9C0E604A
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x061FDAFC3906D4CF75102581546E2BDE
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0xF17860F4B42263AB58FB16770E8B1DAC
deepening into total obscurity.
0x10A791B6616324AADA870A893FF3EF8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xF72063CA9E5607B96CAF2F871BAA5946
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x84CFE3027D2AF9A304FCCC64257DBC03
his journey."
0xA55649A62DA22CE3472D97A6DD8784BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x3FB25007FA72851A51809CFA359549E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x5717729DEDD9A7207A6AE02E951B4458
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x3A86C8994E7BD944FB23E41228001E5D
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x511BC463EA0D6B401B08FF3C70F7FF0C
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x3650D3A3099C3AFFA07B58A4C68DD394

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x5FD9482AC56D7C5A83101F4BD085A2E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xD8EEECAC047A79F60FB29D97637C8AF1
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x50735A8EB8A74092626F679BA77C4BF9
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0xBDB99E59D9F0502A985AD9CD2549A6F2
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x2606AEFFC4C4700BDC8A9EC119BD79BA
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x8E2C27FA34CECBA5FD2FE9DBF5B3B310
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xE58F37933724F7CBE67D044944D9052D
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x2F0AC0976F7F33974424E501DE80266F
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0xE6FFBDA761B19F00CC2787B4E7385B95
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0xC2CA34C4FB56E115A96B8F99483BE551
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0xB7687E8BDEA07C49C74AEEA025A2574B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x290ECBD46E17618D3DD71E7BFF40388C
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x613BFEA3B298C9D96438B114F7F888E8
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0xFB5F603B10B8DCA0576F300D3F892C65
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0xB390FB6523F032DF8221B58D842CD41A
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x7DA4AFCA84BB1B93109D29200B053212
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xE9278ED6DCB7F42B50B11B9D7DD61CE1
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x2FDE1DB07DC54FEFA045A486C6F53E2B
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xB9DDA5E1EE5C320906B735C33970DABD
the evening."
0xE837111EA375636E76B186BB43F26DAB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0xFC189351944AC10FE7A716F730F251E1
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xA4AE1EE1E0750A11E9C6B4214DEFF6BB
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xCF12405F2566F45A14EA90BECBF70B74
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0xBF1D386BEBC829CE21263363FCC0BEAF
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x4BCCA471877EF8B94DE7128D0DD6E8FF
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x5EA1540CA30A876871F5EC83DDAE7F15
was certainly the queen."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0x3B6D1B1799541BD68AB5CD7C826F6C52
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0xF1DEB60D7D1E21740C770038D6981C1E
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xB158BE18F8DD10524B53962BB6049F05
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x515FA55EABD8CB3C115787B4EA2D0A3F
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0xEA43DB2D99FDF97F236516FC062813CE
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0x8FBD3EF7F3D583AD1238E370AC55A49E
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x80504625635E9F17CE5A782675866824
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x5EBD50BED659CA50CC6E2239321FC559
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0xA638C29BAD67ADB1919F94B025593C23
jetty mass of her curls."
0x8C38D0D19E40B4E68BE45EEC33284CF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She was greatly admired, of course?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x0B0664B1EB9B5897E4E93A4A1B3544EF
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x39703035B6E7DCDD2AEE465C663F1351
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0xA082C00BF016343E7BB59B83D36AC957

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x95FCDD633F8A45BF54DA04D83AEDBBFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xC520D61054085EF5FCB5DD77CDC0EF08
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x86CAB6609A1B22C6B74500B23B0E983D
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x7C7ADAC3585C2227878DB4FE6D38F922

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xACABF43DA8A6EC37AE51C032059FFBF2
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0xBBC5627E8A71915BD86E967F11C13CF1

0xA7689B0BD765EEC8D60DDBFAB305FDC7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:

Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x2C2BDBD0E993C1F6511B84E45654086C
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0xAEAD869A15C7F521F194369F34D0E96E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0xD51B3AB0D86309CF84C7F57D1FC50F74
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x2E92FB7CCCC08FC2F866DF02DDF8FB5A
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the

conversation was turned into another channel.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x4BC566F2E4ACDF336A9377FCF15B11ED
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x6EC285CBDAF430A21BCF65E5224F33E3
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x192E1C5A8C5E107D41212E6A86330B22
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xA4D108D8A37EBC0B6A41A35DCBCDD45A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x2B7812289594CB16F0761CED4B85C03C
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0x0F2F40328469C821C091203F00459CE4
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0xF87EB8ED9483E8120F322528C108DE1D
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x9C3ED48CC40DD9B6D184226361F68010
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0xF54DB3C81CEE9E45B71AA80BD758A365
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x343C4FDF4884685D890C7B16097707DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0xA443A839627CCC61FF09838505596EC6
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0xE79E3F3B255C66C4FFF173338811F663
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0xA95107AF8EF397B126B428BCEAA1C8F6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xFB9F58544618A507889397B7F255A6FF
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0xD1B8E6092D295FE1F2BBDA16F1C57F52
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x0D31222D257BEB5D7BE5C955C00AE978
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x3740CE2040D879373B32951C81BBB5F9
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x788E9E7FB1B6EDC9FFFF0ABAB321DA18
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to

yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0xEEBD93E1B0831EF20A685F6E9F3F4674
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0xB0A9D07BCBC534B5E26F0E816AF1EE1C
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x857A40D0366936D77ACC804E7EFBD705
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xCCCF707293289F3FA61C370C04B49A18
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x38EE67CA8799E9D1985C31F41916A007
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x4AF3111253B84828A2AF28107BF96434
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0xE3C04DBCD8F518D54E418029274A4D98
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x50586A50D1260D876C1160B232388EA7
is no extrication.

"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0xAF6C2BF3A1E04AEB1D1ADF3689C7565E
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0x8E2F0F43E7D775AA86AAFB9AF42918CA
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0x625EB2C086F3C5E7F1B417E7783354AE
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x6996CE2D1F884A1A09B47E61E265A09E
poor, and plain.'

"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0xA4FBA1787A4C58742ABA99FB60B4C3E0
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xB6827F999EE395C173D1134715BC3A38
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x70AF8FB99D96E7474B15D0FA472C44FD
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xAE6B36C213BA2A6CB3FA9249B0065C6D
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0xC277756CCC2AC85E6848EB42D0FE6D4D
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x3AD3A752ECC60CE7A16824C99EC2FEDC
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x4647736A82420742C4FF97F6AAB785DE
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0xA7E922B2161EC688C9455FD9DCF3FB32
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x1D6501384D0AFD774F665CC06C85496D
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0xABEA82510171676A5A2336C7CED3C27C
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x0D5D750AA07959860BC03B865A50EB38
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xDA7C8BED309D93FDCBB91E6543177B42
accomplished lady of rank.'
0x0B5CFC96EA820138D5B565471BA68106

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0x41DC55F2D655F282D6CEA345E1AD29E6
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x2AC21F5A89729DF932DD33B8FD0BC8F5
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0xFC6BC029A5A71760B0ABE7FC10BF56C2
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0xC6402D27182073828AA532D6B0C23767
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x36862B08629E719D557B95D0F79D34A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0xAFEFC1AC87DC5CBDE9E03A7374F89DFF
calm, and fell asleep.
0x8023879E0F216DDE64849D68B6E9D0B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x94973476A73C2EC6CF86B178F42893F9
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x54B6382F00D4F8D27CC5D2902AC913E9
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x08BF4F36D76A0C2C27C7F971AA1810FA
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0xF0D92411757EE42C68301CD8D1B14E36
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x75E715F6F5C9E49A819506FEEA63006B
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x155FAFD2AC2D7C102AFF5A723C7536F3
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x726B90F6F2757402B80242426FCF48FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x8DFED3B74F3443B3DB840E77BEAABE82
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0xEDB0A701EEC0333C110C7E13AED3F0EF
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x5309C079480C85DFA742F40DF84023E8
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x78470F5731307DF58C3BBA7EF169D674
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0xDFCECE292D986A77C15B4D35FE0A028F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0x31263E1FD08B87EC717070530DC54719
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xDB39B718993FE5D8AFB4371B3CFE6629
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xDCED2B51C12D34F9237C8DF1412E09CD
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0x0C2BB501C51814E9FFCC8329F0BD97F7
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xB69BF5F3A08439D553601654B435F208
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x776B0C944779C8F806D81912B4C5B600
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x260EFA171F983B61A2C4D2CA870C3DA8
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x96F279F631E2F2E9C656C68A46342817
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0x9F6E5A794913763B0FBC73E26C8F3122
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x9EC2E218D3EFD024ABC04558E050223D
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0xD3D75F66C72F60DC83442D44DBBE40FA
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xCDCBA35B4ED352AA853A35423D30291B
on the contrary, I just said--
0x378D514B2F9CAFD38240A0B02E4C6CE8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x2D96F097C9A6C558E73A88D1D35463F9
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0xAF08F9C9844B9AC391EEB48ABFA5EDC9
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0x66F3ADC7E6000A344678083ED785CFC2
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x2461E491DAB5AC38BC6A9906E130E333
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0xA1FC834446F18877426CC32AD3321E45
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0xD569397999C086B0E316EB248A7040F5
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x5CB2F400760454C30700F0E71656CE56
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xABE231F916EE994665EEAFFE1123EF5A
wanted and would be despised."
0xA1478F552FF9F17CFC093E89BFAAB9C9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xA1DBC76F843ABC74975DB78F6387D894
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x5C81FF3339C7161C8428AFA10F3348EC
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x992833B4380D5A9589F5D798991DD525
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x26A4D659B4B5B686F62BF9ED02A1A837
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x2F624214EFC13FDDBEB8FFE4A4B967E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x4AE1F061D9624DC91DC21E7B3DABF25A
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x8F5AAD147583368C38BEDEBAB0B51EC9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x9FE0943F9DB1C4DDED3BE7DAD2EBC451
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0xB0FB5EA76C79204DA530A99847564BFD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x23E85863F38727CACFC967CA54E60066
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x2324086535D1F777AD4F2088D574CD53
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0x3609E5492702BE866B02B9B3C96A446C
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x6D076015CFF63A5B09AB9C295306F5C0
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xBBFB9E87CAE25B3905471D5C5908A6FC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x3630EF078470D3860FE87473129CB5E6
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x6FD60A0006D73BF064FA172F9657B6D1
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x3DDE0A56A2FFA48E9B903535B5488C01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x7FD8DF0EFDA9E82488E9CA68B21F15EB
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0xA3CD6E61BAEE2738D2DEF4474CBDA60B
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xF60A2D56E37B52C4F8C0377F7F6BD175

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x57E5F986F68580DA65AA39BE2103A7A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0xE92A39DEA92628BC5961CEB444A771D1
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x6762117A4179020778D95AE1CF56A0BA
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x88F4C38629FD9B1134887AF927A1E936
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x5D26B8388F1396FAFB7EA23FA47F03F7
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x2411A178C2DD4EDBE3E7C9C8342B1E3B
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x4EF3C0933FBABB15AE35F4495113648B
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0x6161A66DC378E3BF7F51B02D0A02040D
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x15359304258E1E8A4C65D6FB3D9522F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x1BEDFE3D394DB3B90027BA9A9E206093
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x58A56DC85CAD83F73879BE34857CE20D
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0xB13934E8FD7B6BB6B63CDDAD4B127C70
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x2A88D61077E7FCD415B0A7E6FB46AE78
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x765F4FE4F76AFB0923974DDAE9367C49
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0x785481014CC30CD332D564CC69109981
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x268B40419A45EF42B6CCC27D09760CD9
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0x63285794D054D5DDE684E195CC43CCAB
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x42C29396D89E5CBE5A960F7FBC416C44
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x488E2DC0AC20282EF9E03C0EA5C9570F
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x889C39DC72AD513A64FAA9470D3C263D
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0xDF283CFAF3F7D780ED4DC7C33D65CA5D
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x7D0F0765D04E3BFBEBB9F83B85C3AB26
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x96C780D5B17AEA9AAE12F92B2E4EDAB8
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x911497C1E9BD2B78AC248E08AE811543
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xEA9BFAC64A2574AB9F57152B7B4D204A
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x66D087E45DF2C124689453DC9AB7E961
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0xBE813D1EC2C31EA2A7C2565D6A391185

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0xAE99749DE27C255A2B09C6429F1CD549
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x8B3F810F8ACD2AC285B3A573F1EBD177
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x0AB688FF5361298A27EC986B77AD7277
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x80834AB6C20A6CDBBD2386F7BFE1D6A7
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x7E326B54541DE69FF895FDB18542751C
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x1116524F329D7AA3EB25494D3A9669BE
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x002883D408D592BD2A5352718FD7703B
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x44B28B149F576E70364D7D40ACCB8F2C
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xD7726FE86E88AF1583DB0FD7679BCF8C
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0xD0E2AD93E91B88D1725F3F4B7963E69E
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x78B3A5DA26108BC793166F892EAFB5DB
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x2CEF63481583E481130A52961EB019CE
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0xD4A90E2D08C2AF66344CA069C02E1B77
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x8A3DC5CF09819839DC51ECB7CB1B5B14
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x0BE7B912F7DC7B4AEAFFE28F63A6C8E7
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x861B0FB150A3FCA04199BC35965FD036
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0xED5E05917472221BAB2765CE11FA0374
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0xFD300D9A9B6EC287D5F8E8F526D99FF9
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x7A504F6F88CE8DC4068036A08393F3B2
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x52CEF2421A67B128039059E7B848FFF5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0x8A03D212FD58B6C756EAC265B2B95618
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x82BB0C39F59CAF812C4E6E6F8D718CD8
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x511A6DE64B2EE825961145F30D71B88E
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x840A8557C958DBFFF6676FC625525A04
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x07039CD9286F94C749F7366A4BF8303F
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x77DB29BC48975793A6EB80CD943B66CF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0x017E144B28DC2B53CF059AEF9D1BE28E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x997CB2E131E98BAFD91D83F86DFF11C6
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x3588C06DD1A9A0AA0FC359C835F9B711
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x0CA50D336F29F6C6C19707FBEE63E199
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0xB8F587DD58ABE2CA5FC446CE02606D60
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x95CC650FC91295D9F7AF6458EFD898CC
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0x8D525C8E34C92F0C76F592880B215AF5
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x5BFDBF4C652E94FFCF82037762C5F29D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x9E79A55F8B9B149BC110C892AFE52F75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x708511AAC8AE073E91B5F4C8416B4998
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x10D636D5FAD2D90D28B17F6525D47904
the money she gets."
0x117FFF95D4883D163F2B47D4E391D404

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0xC6A06EF6C4BA767E77FBBF3A74677FD7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x274C5A5FA899EC9A7572B87BE0DA7350
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xB64BA5AA9E8D442A011559B5C13CBFFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x88244DE6C15135574754F61944D68D2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0x64E98EFFFE3588413859BAB374FD5EEF
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x800C73F578D4DA05D3ED00D68EC8D783
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0xA2F70707C58FB42CD34F46BE122C36F4
excluded.
0x2580B94CA35D656C5BC863724A3CF108

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0x2BAA1E8A76FC3EF959F1F6FB8C59742A
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x75F4A2162FDB0D3D0E30F173465CCFE5
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xEEFA762575092BA4C926E54E07CDCBB3
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x64EA93D7D0CBEC0FBE536B3601B02CC4
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0xC415AC8AE0F7830D0CF103CB9E0BB6D6
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x86D6EF50C81132E0C32B2563B509FA12
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0xAA03D22EAEF6EA3C3E2D0B84B97D3E3D
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xFFE509C0D170625DE37D4DAA2D4EB993
sides.
0xF15FCEBCDACA38D609FECCAD4DB75B94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x5DDC7578C60CA1A36CB5095C478AD6A3
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0x17B3D9BE47A5F54BAC9180108CB5F8C9
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x496F971C6468DF1A4188042C8316B3D2
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xEEC4D4E672454584A970E9A94E585640
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xE8DC6A99E4930019C58B402719734024
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x4CCF99C1620257FD227F13F338D4CAE0
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x20DD31C58ADE12F91D4F300688174294
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0xA682F69552B513C23F6B9DE7FFFED583
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x05FE54048762F739248F90FA3AF774D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x38E708805AD0DF4D9D48267E89CAB3C6
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x8843BEC381C1AFC1C0B2C52BF5077ED9
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x2FC2086669533322B013909F36A31F80
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xDDACAB63205ED96D7B2F0D35E370B5D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x62361071F657AC3C813C0B2D01597060
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x3DA4682D8810147A87982B2783A5AAB2
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0x279DB7D3FE1D533F1598858C0FAAD9F6
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x86AB43D3B53134B4A8205277F63CC92F
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x765B3AB14330249D62AEA0709EC9776C
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x833CC99D7EB4332D74D069D098C4AE9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x848995A1E8473EB152EA1A3CA2A4EE0A
minutes."
0x5612E6FF3171A55613E329935A5CD221

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0xCE611C52BE7A3349163CD46FE3E1B845
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x25FBA8469D8D0676B6FE0896E74DD24D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x6C384B7357AD0E228F68C21EAE84A76D
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0xB6EF52B630133EDA00E27681D9DE5205
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x75325F17378B7B6E02652D40A6E69DEE
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0x377479AF44263E654CC50E7F34637FF5
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x067B3C70D085A9A3FF6B2141036C046D
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0x5A3B14B4239B920F574D9C6664F88D65
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0xE9C44D9A5EC47477A9F45B2B414FDB66
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x3116B565FC4588F800169FEA4D3A2F8F
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xB1018354BE8BACB1960CA02FD3B249AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xB2A4B29C383C0E11BDE12972C193C7A1
below.
0x23E4EF1E8123E9EC370871C89E9CC674

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xA191CC21B018A81ECD51E3F45E41BA3C
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x5092E04936B9376AC7093B3E74439CFC
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x296E35342E53B7B963BEB4040CAED165
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xE827EF4E168BF61CCE27D6366F6D34DC
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x7148134DFE4EC8050A79A9F46E4400BE
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0xA4817C34C23D24CA853DA6AC3BD7B321
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x00A73A7457BC962DA5F0BCC4BF9B4056

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x30E15A586DEF63AD30E7DCB7A92F23D4
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x58A2BB0EFDDA437EDC956A0052F57E79
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x0DFEC29733CDBE8C7909382B05DA6A07
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x77C9C21FA83C10B4194C4558265C40D3
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0xEE6319DA9CB543FD37605CAB7FE594A6
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0xABCEFF9730DF43D3DA9C8BE7F701C52B
and, for a time, a hush.
0x88B58B9DBB67000DF5C2D8DA1418A01D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x668B4D682FEE5B14420ECE88CF57D888
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x4D547EB77B159979B799A171B11A97A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0x47FB214291D513F42B731BE2393BC2B8
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x07AE62E73446F3D2F5A584C6BF2F70A3
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x66031955895518F14DD5C87D9DDA5E0C
on apprend."
0xEBF0DD76FDD3713D1852D39569451B1C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xEBA041097F11086590BA70C7B8C098F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0xAF51C22D8374BB7876A175300770115F
mange."
0x53A76A3EB3191C086F32AEDA35916B70

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xAB331ED641817666ECF2319C4C36D635
get you something to eat."
0x09336AB087B495E612C058DEA8B832ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0xB5916A04C703C1A42835DFC95C4AF2D0
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0x4B7FF9B2D6BCA9198E669930E5BEE123
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x0C433D82220A296DC0B9C935331BBE57
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0x7CD2A19106EAFF46F866788584290329
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x5149A30CFE2EAF2E96D99FFBAA5F8FB2
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x26C8D4B33E7D764FF856701F0F5773BE
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x9086BF00FC4449EDC04446A78CEC1287
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x33EEBA9C9B9D91B5A402EBDD6885E80B
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x9845F4B214FAAB5D69B315F9D6FC662D
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x8BE92C8A63F420CAED2C9713D8404E52
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0x86D2F1A5F5B2EFCC6244A1A9AC317F5B
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x94619DD8F168B9BE651F1769A655926F
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xBBC4DFCE1FEAB30CCA966DEAE853D1C3
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x8E569C99CEE39BFC8EE44976B8C7F399
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x06EA48015E276C8B8701F393E0FE8E09
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x4E66F854882B744AC0CC89146170F909
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x5586902BE2804D5447D0A48AD859EA9F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0xF2B021A370D493A9CCEC8768D7AA53BD
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x55E8132E403E42F3E842371E9974A02B
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x502E39FD4F4F5BDFA92EF7FCEB45BEC1
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x64C855E1B1CA4BB1D89B7B30C7CBEAE1
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x817D849B5A22E244C1F17D39D0B7C13A
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xABAE7242F3039F04EF4ECD606AA8DCDF
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x83390CC55A3F60C6C144A44D3C21257E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x58E6AB611ABFAD9902420DA03304C93C
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x48620626F4B00DEA9B8EFA309075B1EC
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x131056DE2096FBF723E1F91CF7BDDBD0
dinner?"
0x4C883FF73E834AA437BB0EA069EAEA52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x14126D11ABD590B691EC1D01E6FC617F
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x23AC07F675AEC849170A8C68531E9892
is your dinner."
0x55FFE82A5F08E4AC1D5128788E0E1AEF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0x1B7B0090ADDB3E7A23F736621074C427
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0xA47BF193165B490EEEC5EBB7355E6064
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0xA8F195335A9BC09BD6FE7DF7926F331F
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0xB0D270756FFEC920897254AE6A3B4EB3
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x6D330322D58269F7FA0D872F1522B155
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x8C00F983D30D00DDB1992C42598F2457
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0xB5E9CEDF280BFED364755D999462B5C6
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x6C8420CCCBE81CC0B8FAE850CE4CCBF1
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0x34D8CE4166D401E0EBF8B96FDD39E562
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xB82EDA72C9AE72B3AE82B99ABDD2C354
quel dommage!"
0x03FC2C6C4DF7B225EFD2D355E8E3052F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0xC5C230FCB809F0C572EB78175740C15B
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0xA9D4F7963F08CD82833077E76E8067BA
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0xA9E448D4A0C92A48E36CDCE8252E1C53
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xE332D28FA3BB4C25F46DFA7C2500DACB
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x117695E5B60807F55AB8F2ACB01EDECE
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x04EE8BB25296B108670B127C61D63B5E
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x2F742BED0EF9CA174456236B32F6B2E2
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x792B8630AC4B37D3455326C3D2FFEDD9
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x4DC5CED24031A056CCC9CC23E319A2B1
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x308CF80F70B6A8FA85E1EF8CFF528DED
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x25F7B4A6C92DBC8A410886ED71FCDEC4
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x988E6B57C8EB0ABAD07AFC943EB87F41
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0xE7897AF08C6A287F07CDD75E337B6351
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0x10AC24AE094743413635861B99F34D05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x9D4FBC7DAB575E369CE78DBB78E2F7D1
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0xB1D9719F7F9556D106CAE802F01ADCDA
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x54CAD11D7EC9025BAFD312A300F29707
sought their chambers.
0x38CE92F1481AE990196F1DC28034CEAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xE536E8DA2933C2E44C345F4F9C4977AE
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x43D758E2259FDAF6EFF68B7D7C9E5E87
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x641B8E1FFACAEC6206077A3660349E29
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0xF68913BF341AA2F5A115BB130F1BAE5C
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x85EB55437734F5FD6248368797CD067A
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x264DA36B750288AAE7F9B10268199278
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x51A6ACCC5C32B87E323CBB608D303D94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x192A20F330F5E8B5D887A02E336FE1E9
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0xB05A8B76C239812FA5CE3C8A23B0776C
ladies."
0x753FEF81BBADBB76B8A2220A1568521E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0xB7D54EF3B7A4CF0CB210E492206138D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xA57308062E7835B3E11A108EFCC060E4
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0x6B0687D381E0B6C6973280393228F79A
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0xC7BE6404B6A579C31A2058B92CFB72DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x4D5F433EF0B72C3B5F22D067DF22E657
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xB7EAC30548930835F4AE5483C8FCFFE3
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x6EE1CE852A72500B0012BF63D2EE4B42
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0x73148CB4C57C658D0E702FA9B49B76C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xEDF1C94CFCE0826B430EC3A7925619ED
answered.
0x79B69322AEA233CAA8B2185C8F9FFD02

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x2CCC09FE2F3FC23CA47CFDF3C571081A
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x767345D2BAF291D02A1454167149AB6E
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x1F9858D393D4ED7A2D61BFF545680DE4
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xF093CB7F6DF79B7E42C25365FF9B6D55
case of contumacy.'"
0x770B4BA67974B5DB1291F194CA1B7DA4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0xADB77CD2471FDBFAC51044CD5392151E
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x392598068C5473C6A813792151DE1957

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0xA40945ECA032EAAFE014F0BB3099EC50
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0x8FD8E5A2455098E32937C9111D70D392
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0x0D9FF509189EF6568FA6CEBAFA4D56AE
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x8E3EEF150B308D6525ABC059D63B7DF3
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0x2D0502E1D26E3B5D7DA56B733C77DE52
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x70A36871859D2FC7F090494C2B0AA3CE
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0xA0DE65C6C878337788C89FA673E0FCB6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x8A911B47D5146EE0D23BA8F2D521FD69

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x63F34AB332C1C5FC62ECED71A6283DAC
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x15A951F7AF922E62DEE05E326D611660
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x67C4309E085FFEFAF239319A525CF61A
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x0B8D69A1D996E5136CEB854248EAEEE8
stay at Thornfield."
0xF9D06A135E2BFFEA94335C61CEFFF358

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x1E91E2D894FAB7DF971C1E126788AB3E
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0xBE4C7ED8FC7CBD9A05741D04DF03AB6A
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xC89276E7BC21C815751DCE7A64578F6A
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x8B5E382CDFA96BBC7260F951E2E9255F
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x717F03219B2CC464D8B8CB059F2B6C5C
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x529E58426AFF9776A698750824A6D745
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0x12C8F275DF40628D4D9980A4B17120A0
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x0EB5C19225C70BFD714C576E20930F83
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xBF05DEEEAABF00EF7C371D4E60FEE224
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xDD8AA4F826CC0B65BD7342FCD52C0214
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0xCC556EC47162D5FDEB907A8AF44A0386
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0x8A547E455AA074E882048A7C0CBB9ACE
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x16A57013D7068AE8A28A89B9EB93F229
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xDAF9AAE185C667B83B891D5FE2EF0331
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0xE0615129042964F1F047B936FB2BC40E
descended.
0x31509393F8A22C0C9FC5D92A264800F8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x6AC9176EC6107F167FE022E1A73C78C4
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0xCB809BA7B186869EC7E8D3703BDEAE7E
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xC557685622283BCF042B6D9DD6F4970B
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xD6D285DED3353ACB5FD7FC8F21470066
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xB28AFA366018837775775D67B02F5763
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0xE1A78E833DDAC4B74A92FA1B9943D80E
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x2EE94FB0956AEFE1F36AD3C7675D4C7C
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x27507DA68030D089A013826516E01825

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x09FE5BF0D86E6C3BCA09A62D95F45BF3
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0x0FAF084A83542FF5911D8AB2F0212300
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x6BEE9DE556ACAC4501FA79BBB062C7C2
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xF4B49AE4994E9C378567A4ABA952CC4B
touched my knee.
0xF154451FF692D9E9F0610B62A23DBFCF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is it, Adele?"
0x7E155770EA5CD4CAAF7A20DDD1BF2B37

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x0540E283B0C519DDD07552F2FF2D09AE
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x0886CDE2CA696C94A59FA18227F565FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x21E35FA1202D6DB189614F4AE84F1C6B
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x4B4247F180C601D04E357D80D06A3CEE
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x4E55F560BFCB6C630EEDB94CF5AD0C63
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0xC68D480C3DE4E8C9A43A1459F142956B
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x92F6493148E7EF4AF9BEC6E4D6F9C78C
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x8283AE9DEA8E2EABB67789633B96FCCE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0x93DB93553C9F6AA74939D7ECD377CD93
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x9BEB8E3C981339F67D7B7A647C1E966C
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0xF3C9D31920600C170896E9CFFB02AFE9
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x0FAA1F5631E8C4C3A4283C36155921FE
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x3120D89BDAA012DD361D21AD754A8D26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x653458D57CF3F3C89A9179EBCE335531
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0x2ACB5F82D1E5980569B9C79748158DD5
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x3F6FE826E420C5DB82D466BD512188BA
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x37019F846A7A2C0225DD8FD95C015C10
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x0EEF4FA0805F9EE6B40D1097FE15ED8C
stared at me.
0xEC5351C182A77699F468EC72D434F76A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x4935CB86BA0D7262DA0A2529FD50E236
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0x44308AE9857D340F9618405A5A5C4D21
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0xBA5CB2AE1753E986563E2B6F4D739630
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x988F5F68A6A769B38A182F113CB09FC0
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x83D31682D57718812F2739E2F8C9E27C
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x9B5152593B3AD3EC99065486D9FBA03E
and may as well mention them now.
0x12A3467D7EC131ACE91A4734B89B189A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xD1F115220D603C1EBA95E00D012E18BE
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x0A8FBFF8F7AE214E33F2029BB4FEDC49
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0x1C783EA4365BD0C239A56B65A5BB2511
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0xAFCA5B4962FD594C738B1B08129CF348
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0xE42C142C201D4D6FD4A823C278422736
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x1495B0EFC6DC8A7AC0EF186F79E79339
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0x60A5D093156D18733B44E687A611B37F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0xFA554813C7E067347A14B1F531FEFCE5
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x475B6CAC07643B5979BE15B2BF3CE878
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x866BCEE2411C7756CB82308D051C8AD9
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x063055CA0966D85F721F29467DEC71DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xEA631D5D201C93E0783409C1577AA664
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xF09E1F2BEEE102B0888CA309648488D2
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0xF5268F1935A8CAB69352A48135957384
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0x82C50784D0F3CA8F1098B38995AC2A4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x2062B02D0A9BE15E28BB28FF6C17117C
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x98518F209843B4DDE44FD57AFB855E8B
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x95791EC5578288FD6B3846D448A2F6C6
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0xE55EF86B4A0CC656807B98565E165B9F
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x8B8DF2C9A0B5D7677EF7AA38F4F2B889
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x641080C71479C92B4D1B56B1FDBA13E7
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x0C2256454B73A96253526E47EBA460AD
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x4D4CE27343A7CC082A04D5099745AD09
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0xB409132F699C15ACEC56911A5F248363
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0xD504E1E6D09524BD629CA49A9EB1EF37
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0xDA91AAED8DC5643BA3728086B7E9C487
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xA6136B9C8C303939BB59620D95E04897
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0xA385167CE7DF1F079403FAC98EEE1C5C
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x7C175EC07097E2D82C66CFD0BE294E65
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0x06417A62D76B8B499D3305C14821AF7A
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0xD76900AF7BA639784BF943101F53EA78
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xB3554D7F3B9124CB803C619579437D95
truly imperial dignity.
0xAD7FA8B91B8869F0B1E2AE57CC5F45AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x8469102F160B2392B7EDBE5144487436
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x4F9FA2A84F7B668F2D77E67031703BC1
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x660AAD767EBE371114F2E9B7383EB9CC
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xD0BB8C772184C7582FB37A9F6B92BF5A
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xA2C66E422A868401B7D760E0A93A942A
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x36C08C085D703E80A04A95ED02063708
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x68C7F976A4001AF179D1ECCAF69E6DBB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x71D5028C50CF13E98B7EF9212012DE0B
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x69E2D33069C968E983E2F90438940B10
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x278A1E5B0DDBF090166553F0BC35CFDF
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0x8BF1FBBBDA3BE5E5017CC3610C97BEDD
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x446272DB6CDA7FB54957B3D3488D7725
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0xA06D6438A2E951EF257F94BB1A97197D
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0xAB0DD3D2C5B8612A577C7AFD943D00D5
haughty lip.
0xA07D024B117E8F095C27787E1A45BFF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0xB52FB76876FE2D1D0D553FBC11EF9EEF
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x0AFF8BF1A04424E8545A638D4F9F4BAA
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x3FD843B2D3531928A64276BA4E497437
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0xB50EF87B79044F15451DFD675E0B4C96
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x58AE0019AAF4761D9654032C339EC2A0
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xB1409B948F18EF584415585462C614B4
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x9A24B85256D15F3A8685A60D7A46BACC
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x64CC0DA69EBD10136EBA6B88287F383D
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x8362267C05B65582E900EE8328738726
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0x913A7943080EB50B9F4107082BEDB500
with fluency and with a good accent.
0xF16E9B7FB0E523EF1088D4AF39B16E55

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x8D66DF58767DAA2087800EB289B343BA
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x10DB6B457A6186F86DD354139DB2763A
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0xE3649F8578A645A9EF0304153D07A147
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xC0B17256FDACA21792762132054218A2
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0xB41C576E8885954BE46040A602BE942A
in spotless white.
0x84052D899A5DC63E02904DD3AE50FFF4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xF778E81D92FAE0CD7E8F59C17F0F806A
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0xB8953220E2836393B0BB51C920F30EE5
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x5D15756E7AB4FAE51C502BFC354C1DF7
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x8CACC2409022CDAEF79DC8D249266CC6
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x7CB50DBCD6089121C7CC1B38FDB8B6D1
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x469F0494DD239AC75A2C122A3BAA5E0A
together.
0x053CA3995D0548884C198E38A95D2CB8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x3F9A2D38F9FC8F1F18F67F98C72AD7FF
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0xAD6903C86398FEE721E63CDD301DCA70
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0xC3C13B6D964AA0583D3CC03D3FA0F02A
gravity--
0xB99164EF55583AF560E52ABBF8E37887

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xFF730C27887A19FF344DAA473B1A9354

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x7F15C6DB161ED57D08EF9769674F40A2
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x130FCB5982C6829E9B20560CFA10381F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0xED9BC9F81B21FCB384509122405729CE
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x0EB8827C69F4C2C5BFE72BD466F68449

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x85A89D50C6E95931D80C32FFB97F6BF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0xE327A2BBE2EE6B0B26A0B7E1C33DAC70
child!"
0x9CAB89A26AB7E42958A5C2D8D03DA89E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0xDF4A5C0D0428E914FEB5340B2E6AE38C
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0xCC3D63D08367DEF385E1A3F51AF87825
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x99E79CC79C5F605E1CAD3DADE9902727
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x0F62C93934359BA175EA2040CBCB0D3C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xD412176A820158E84AC9B3048AB3A8E5
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0x8F7407B6F82E3817D3F4BA9DFA8FB38A
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0xF4344CEF18391019ABF076A7D020430A
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xC0FF2EBF549E996782DCA4E3F7FFFD27
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x4B115529F9E1C74E29D0C55B972B1579
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x98D8C1B3898EEA07FC39BF249BE76114
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x861B670025C7499E591862AD54404630
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0xB75C4A381E9F74CDB957A39A51999123
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0xE591955FC2D2849AE136218581464440
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0xDB47380ECE0EDD8B557078BB8CF4BE26
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x3EE9564686E9B0FFA2A17A685E63426F
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xA6F2408F612A1798385E79CEF72E6021
blood or vigour of brain.
0xDD70B8BCFFF34D46872DAF85AC915329

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x9A65A06CC9F592A2C25E1B3B334156FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x142F53374B4DA001E53723823A832DDF
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x02929F7CE31723E3A7348A97A1C28617
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0xC481EC4CB74B8CE175D4BA7AAD1B463A
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x58F2F666CFBFA1C9821B77E673CC20A4
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x207F0F6E60BEFF67D2CF70D439A72946
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x298A26BD4CA7D26F6A7509ADDE394EDD
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x3A0167D4C818EAD35C88BF4B7B194D44
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xAADD0183FFB9870669D0CB005DD0A9ED
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0xDEE1B31C52EC9F1D39379E60312A42CD
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0x552FEEE92840F2287203634DEDF907C1
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x5F5B2784E1133CB5B12B7A936BF42CC5
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0x19484F533D0EC5BEC176C47492149487
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x3314CF59E9702C601A4F7D49884A2E90
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0xB7C364CEAD7652CE301DBA3E952DD606

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x539EB4809211AEBA3AD996A946BC4376
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0xE4B26E1C8F6E8879093C5F30725F4AB3
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x982EBF1067B42A239278B46BE78B5D3F
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xCF83DA8F5AF8F78F972BF06D5460FCA5
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xE8EBC8DF6C1C05BA0E780B05005A167E
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0xE053292F8E80F870ED85C3016D7CC801
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xC6EA8A99A7B03D34D3B72E346A85D616
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x14C919D86314EBECDF33393F04DAF776

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x74441C36785612AFB0FD6F5EA14486DB
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x97B6B595F288EDB37A25F8347BEDCBD2
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x9F86563327F9EDFDD7C5305912A56C8D
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0xC33E60FA7389E187AD9E9D64965D8045
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0xFECDCC87479103745E9EEE54EACDAD03
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0xE9938F693F013B954AD84D2028886D02
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x28E414B2B7AED37FF9A83929AB31025D
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0xB28898C10CB3F4E7E612D131359E3B9E
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x3E473603448101D32AF6E0CEE55D7B46
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x531566F94022DBD39FCB738EC620AE3C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x1FFA91B77DF3D8C5699DA70ABD35FA3C
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xCAC4D0571F28CE779B0C4F83B6E18864
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0xED10C4E892811931B365AFE2DD04346A
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x787E10D8E941B01890EBFBF34D0C4EA8
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x1A8577AFF18494E426E016B371238E8A
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xA33648CEE70DA0E5CF3B37C0AAB132A1
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x27560A7AAFF94B05DBC583B361FA1BB0
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xD4B4B6EA6EF0BCEB55DD8B024E3BF6E4
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0xD89C62333947903652C4FD69A5825526
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0xDD0B9C751930F68FF470D5D091BA9381
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x35C2951C49374E1A463F9B69F58CA86E
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x1970F93AFCF758F3E1F4B733F35C68D5
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0xD9F9DCE0E2FF9D87FE8A78F0F45A350D
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x13B06FF9B8A0043B5276A3D7607CF12F
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0xF9E12F953C5D4F3CB86C69DA68E2AB74
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xD886C67A2B57EE807CA0C97B934FD2AC
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xA23462C745F4E9C5C1A74D2D801CE2CD
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0x14F47A66E27193F02B72CAE4303C92A6
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x489C116046AFC611B05C6CC5B460EC96
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x4CD72AC99BEF337F7AB92AB6CB59B6A6
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x7554C1A64CB9277DE99A432FB41D8BC1
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x28CC09AD49DB3F38656EBF60AE15AD12
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0xE21DE321664428298A17887A03C0887E
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0x1487E117D39E362B84BE41125ED7017B
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xC294BD2A229B62EE18020E59675E6379
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xDC892A8FEB7F4F4342ADA54243CFE536
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0xBA3B7A8FA6BEB794335AB03C0EE81709
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x253EF04E93EEB13671EB5D771603F110
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xCFADC2C844F166B781F9C21E661F06D1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0xB68AEDEFF27CC8E0EFC0727BF1947941
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x82A4726D4C0A7FAFC6888B9B806D98DD
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x1C810D0AAD69CD79302CF92CD9533F4F
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x6BF7E0E7C54C94CCA753AA1B4A6B3AA0
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0xD393EC2224F56C68FCA38B63B35ACB08
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0xE821E76523A5B5AD1B8F79595E5F6A69
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0x0D97034B504D0C38D3E1DAA7A8C7FBDC
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x000A6BE033292415C73AD2D0459B889C
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0xCF9BE6A8AD983B24EB865974EF916804
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0xDCF3FFA347BD8EBA989E6D42D5A87F68
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x8012CD2E7180C628CBDFEFA4A6F7C6A8
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xE612BA2769E521D0E68C9F0E3F5EE387
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x674FEF2F73110069D59F4638225AE088
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0xED8F5D21C999E1D32E006A66365B1AF0
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x0FB2CFD27F870C12648A333CD38EB75D
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0x513443005DFD1E4ED6EA65ABB10FCB51
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0xAD23B8A41E06186898A9ECC0152160B8
selects a mate.
0xA7ED4C09686C0EBCCF0932F4A529BA2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x496A6229F05E533A3F49E3443AC4DE91
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x4ACF46307812FB83BA7EB8DC46B014F4
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xEA14845AF9F14CFEE9A48A777034DD02

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0x7B810D6519FFFBA0413A3E8BABA1EECF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nor am I."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0xDE09AAE7547D2594305EA906018AF93A
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x123DED4AFC6673A8E16F4CB67CFD0E4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0xFDCFF3615A59E37A73DC863A3AC59196

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You should have sent her to school."
0x99B0B40BE5159158AC2A16C50FC9E36B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."

always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x85DBC2F828AE8C1678BF9CDFBD5D5117
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x3B5CDE207D4DCDA8BC15A353CA781CC9
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x0164C640E0BF6F5281F66F61B789C0C0
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame

Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to

extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our

0xF7A555EF3690B738A7075F7AE17950C4

soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but

Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,

spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant

prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x694A2647C3EC3EDF2F6A54AA7A20EA09
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x0A7E4F08DC98F60CDF4CFF51F281A903
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent

on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.

rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a

had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special

"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x8CCD6D8012C904D9695F86E38B432492
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will

suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x710050BD4242ACE6311F14E72FADB86F
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x40EFC7B11A7DF4E2E6658FFA5921DD54

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x566A163A44B408E58F178762E73E4B55
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x52ED868F230E90773CE92ECC8954A8CC
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x1B404BE9FEB435AE9532F3568BA6616F
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xB2DB8FA021342583C25A3330E77B4324
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x3163B5064BC4BBB4AACE3D118616A812
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0xEE3096CA0B9D7E04BA0BD532E2791A22
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x9D3E69A03CC49780B24031E39EF26AB4
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x03D6D1B4D1D5558EBE82A43B417DA28A
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x1C680593E08D30F2B4220ADBE5824FA5
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0xC58A05FE20302060203CE64356C6A90E
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xDB78CA603EC54A030D66F3EAA4A8A29A
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x0C12105705C6ADA1B66A0D7C9E09E62B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x6410DA7A9D583E1981C4B96631612721

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am very well, sir."
0x7C6B5DA716CD4ABC41A1E22CCA018690

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x44B0D7A71FD0B2EBF59FF0830EFB4F33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x720243118BFC7EB5F6C9F91944805C1B
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x1FEBA6E4227DB662F393BC9647010054

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0xC9F662EB902671CDD8328BB802D4525D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x1A00DF1A194181A4C208E1D86FAE225F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x63BFE46DBD5880E333F99CE0C7FEFFDE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x809310B9AA42F8BCFB9D55EA6A6A1531
What is the matter?"
0x066A505689FB36B383001506156B7120

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x36859BAD2687BA2A936E65755F49008D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x0F53F7A264CEEF80AF86A63AF37D5459

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not the least."
0x12385F8FB18A073053A4D8BC0D35A244

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x565149CB6E3E45D891FB7EF390FEFE65

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am tired, sir."
0xAD5E4A9976BDB32EEA67267F14DC8D8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He looked at me for a minute.
0xAAD6DDAF07FA78093BC57698F788CA39

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x99B7B8E0DA25A3C74CB241A3D1A5D1E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x86278F4C1FF060E46CA6CEB99FE95E04

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x994384A0732887B05251FE9E78728FD3
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0x51E36EF71D473B7E1E95204C563E56BC
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x5A6CE8A41BDB50076A99EFC0841EE619
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x8BF8977AA5C92E948F759427F22A3825
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0x854B743EC86C674FB969FC479CC72F41
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0xCAD2504A5B45268A27D92AD3D3288A50
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x1CA0C38EDAADA115C722F7B22543235D
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x7FA5C29007F53E768E1DFDB36B33293D
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0x204737C803B707EEFAE7E313CBCA66EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x47F9FE3CE3CDD2100DFE90EC433E80EA
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x0784A9FBFEB2584E136C768EE4205770
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x767725D72473F97D69073EFA5200A5A3
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x5443CC95A0324A52C862491E861A7F81
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0xE27477D750B6D50AB6CB328D6C1D3122
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0xF623E48E9257FBE1AD79F07E93609819
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x16FEACD8F151E7E5F9E42CA3D164757C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xCCF40E8CE72D2E1772CE42E1C7AFDA32
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0x69DD9A83F013A50FD90EAF62DBCCA2F3
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0xDAE692C8D90EA4F0F8C93ED9D06F6D0F
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x64755F40628F6A1BCD95A447449A88E0
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xC458BF5598F946D981CDF3F80D00E042
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x1957A4840188D3F9187F0499C10EA752
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0xD7FB698BDF035EED3C4EAF0E44D5EA67

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x06297C5E4D0DED6F5994B317B6D5A304
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x017D60D375E91EDF015CC091CE0883DF
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x8DF0ACD43EC05B353CA16B9C32ADF14B
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x4790049A14D2AAD42205900C13256DDB
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xEFFB77DAFDC6A7B994621FD21E3B8968
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x94B9B36F72FC1BD7CFD9257E5B19AEAF
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x6A61DAB5C9E5897249EAEE32D9F0AB0E
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x4D7B538C3D58AFB4E78066C57D773C9F
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x95865D3D6E9DD29B158AF95CC79E4E57
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x2F1A2651CB95BC87062C5E2C97B161DE
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x6F79EAD3E6F6F311AEAF0174DB0971D6
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x0F8CD3E5C477E42190138DFCB5BCF22F
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x3350F2881A0AA0F23F21ACAE46092DEF
drawing-room.
0x52E7845D3676505CC5B5605C371AEB99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0xFE22ECE0717C85A82559CA34AF38AC4A
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0xC153167F1E94A0D707AFDB12603E6A77
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x2B1EB9FBD5A57F529411F275093909F8
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0xA869E5A821FB4DF9B51FFBF9696AFD01
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0xA9DDEBD72D3037092FCF1F5E0B58D80B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x01C7314A2C2D1F3082D43E63FFE518B5
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x56CBA7F0CC21E0856345A7936633E54A
usual seat.
0xAA3713EC38353D41C86B8A75B303EFF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x33D368C22CCD06BDFE5C57A365B3363D
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xED9754AF6825450FB8D5C86003103408
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xE12EB8010E5F92F69C6867BF3E10732D
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0xE198ED26A88CFA76AD0207E62BBA2C75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x3138E89AF86E4655792560E05724388C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0x39BE1F433EE1D299DB3D355DC557A785
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x7A7E7A45EC94C7040CFDA4F54A2E366C
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0x978939BCED36E29A43B2C0B8F3E2DB33
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x9D2A32EF4E2BCA42D986C8B23B4C7751
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xDAF47978098C2E173647ECF8324CAC0B
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0xA41A3425EE5A7A7B1FBECBF7AC352A57
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x56AF814CE7C67A7EB7BF898C66FD4B02
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xAE92A2BFD8950A2D1A7FB2518FF7E9F0
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x21F62C04D3D6F03C96792E22DB03549F
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x8B440B661A609F9AE104BF033D9F5881
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0xAE735738408130EE3CF0817B57235433
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x1154FBDBB9164EEC0B69E4A0C9FE3E5E
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x664C42193606F98CE59BC178EF378238
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0xEF9AFD6BC9F1601A8238A71D9AA50FE0
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x38A0BD2C6FEE72E0EF5CCA36A113EC32

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xDA63FE959794DBB73F6DA3517A0E2E63

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xD5F67C87907836D08D4F0C333375BE09
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x253BD8DDC58C88D7E2231AA86A1C630C
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x2A42E063151B310CBE82D00F8C5046E4
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0xE18AA5D2F3F26541743BEDC558D688D5
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0xE5BA611D01C29CE55A8DE8CB5847D7E9
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x5A8AC937AB270B6DFE464510DEC84A17
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x71C7EDCEFA5C5C67B38C7F54EFFD6146
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x25646DE5E0A7D5BFC09C67F95F6D90E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0xF75165A70BA13201CB3C85BFF35C9220
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x02224C99719BE30ADE657061B26CD803
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x5D148A25C2F8789B09B1473350F4A724
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x182E1F5C25BF0E82339F660CA382545A
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xF67E4B018CE7BD959542F8E9F209FA6E
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x0DFF2D4A9056599DBF4F76D9B1A2C07B
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x106649D933F01E84F7A2AC1FF85C59BE
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x39CED5C5B1B7B400BA4840CC912A4F0F
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xEFF26DB416268F2F563FE64446417C04
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0xAA1EDBC6B5E188057843261C27EFF317
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xBD6B582FD2E3F16BBFD8B996C06E49CD
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x425865EA89F8F7548A9019EE2FCE5BF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x86D331E00D44A9D950211F4802FB7D4C
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x361CECAADA30EF638BF6A24F358780A9
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x35737DF236EE656F89C43EEE6A79A301
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xD7B4D112C47D5E465036DB5D91A0CF6E
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x19046618BDE2D483B5B2794492DCA359
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0x986560BC947B517447D9044AD3D0BD08
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x9D68857EBB1BC12999E75B4BC8207F90
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0xDD2E150FA3E5D256083692A1F31C0BC0
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x26EEE93DA8D7D3717FF6D77A55304A5F
wanting.
0xAFBE008A50DA8D673C8DF857491EB57E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x6729FECDF01E42D6B22C093F425A13E7
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x8CCCFA906D7B64D837D0FB4DFB3CFED0
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x9E277248B476F98F8A214798E4EB361F
curtain again descended.
0xC883F8F6557BA56618F2FC2F26BC65DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x4EF8EF9AEC3532BECE8D2262561EB393
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x04AFC5FE9E46F8065B4AC20E7F00B5A2
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x73C063B78F575A1F61936D8BB0F2949E
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0xB524F7454257ABAD99C887593E15C150
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x6C2AFD84B6AE8DE451E1E2D34C186E4C
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xD08266D3D372522F1E4C2D118A37B752
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xB55741E08036866CC509C9B4F58C3517
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0x281AD9E8F96A84AFB643E9D20FABCFE4
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0xC893775E83955FADB020FF4C608078FD
attached fetters.
0x609003871B1F9B92F1E65FFEC6F34D96

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x21D11A3AC8E6A4E25A2368114F468FA1
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0xB2F7B59348B8C077D6DDA430367C963E
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0xBE70FF41616495A2EB4F83374BCF055D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x8EC57AC7C7B6DC7940DF8CCC30BA34C7
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0xA2C1A184E2D14272268DE52655F6F34E
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0xE2021212BB8293182B315DD3846BD40C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x161FAD40C20A164CD1123F5F895F4914
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x89FC6220B5C9BF5141FE2CCC6FE9107B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You would like a hero of the road then?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0xD1A29013F78E0C7CCB2341620703F87D
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0xEFD9612121EF7F3A65081C12DB131B78

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xB0D16F0BCCAF820D77692B698F71B9AB
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0x3032F053F9D465C1AF1431C5B0B82A98
colour rose.
0xA40729DD3098A86D13BAD1591906ACBF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xA912A5C6932258C25F867960C20FE578
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0xDD40F60F34494950D59DEC7603440E63
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xD94B638E3B7A5B9056EE640FAC979626
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x1D6F1E2057D458F94A086394752C3E82
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x4B8CCD294D95CA7C98FF5B8CB3CF4356
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x7F3FA3C229E282CAB96B24F363185E67
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0xA244A1C88E8C5C3EE6F2F3E9A42DE53E
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0x8B6980E1FD8A2E95FC3A67EDC40324A5
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xD44FEB01676ED656CC175FC6D8CF1726
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x8C5D74E4568C5067A9A1979A36346334
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0x59CFE8A0DF57A1C473A6BAC3EBDC1B2F
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x72C715842203A64CBF83991EFB3BAC88
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0x8D17E135C2A4F8A60F0F92BDD9F7488E
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0xD758D1DFDCFF226B3889E560E05FCBDA
returns in memory at this moment.
0x36BC7B1430C369B0116F03FC8D0FF2AD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x3569D595D1B4A33EDFF1ACB5BBB2D3B5
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x28FAF9C7C0CFAF696B88E8CE087B05B0
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0xA12B2BA566B97E6F295C2CAFAE97EFCA
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x0684FB0BF116E2CF1DF81560B99F37DB
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x9FD3D27E8A5CB90882982517B0EF2FED
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0xC4F02A09882811ED1DEAF90C05EAC67C
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x2111F97350DA28CFDB55C8E7E0DBDFD7
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x9295874CBCCC706D936533B3BDD000B0
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xBA716C7F3B8C8ACA0CD654B1D3D648A5
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0xEAA39DB24479F7199391D8C9DB97F39C
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x37631C879EA2685E31BDFBBB26CBF099
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x6E13DE6F97FB78A55BDA808B3FCBE2DF
very pride, irresistible.
0xC6348C59078E412A09D30CA32E3C2601

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0x5A3822DA60A2B6836A0D86D9AB1EDE01
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x75CA450258B90260E1F27E4FAE7E91E9
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0xF6CE16AF789948BCE297B1450E5A6F32
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x368623B79F87E127509709CF5752BAEB
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x2107C7F4E9C0B50BDC9BBD0C94320202
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x3B6B262C0D8832929A666D27B14BF6FF
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0x7437BF3259A2015674F16A9594600ABE
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0xBB0BA83935969A6E7EA1A34E8516DBFC
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0xE267AC4BDEB8ABE47EEBD4A7F4A24A8E
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x4F80B8BB99C7EECBC3BF520D9F13368B
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x11636685C00CED3A1F82C30D2B14BE6A
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xA068BF6EB19C10782CD98713BAADF754
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x12C58D46E927C3B5409E52BF5A645C3E
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x6E2E9CA534FFB81FB1B02EB072F168DE
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x53F550CC06CA476CD84E41EAE12EC7E3
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0x1918314A7368D2D13A0D7D69786357F3
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x6FD08973E2EA715CED2411ACCCF69620
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x912B5832D53BE92DD9EBB778509B4952
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0x111E5D8D4F0BB310BE4D702134DC98DB
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x8D444408E5A9A8561CFBD7708452A786
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0x9265BE6902D18672676DDEE496AE81A0
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0xE51B8842CBA3E202F89A3196ED8B5DFE
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0xEB1671E192329297C0B3396A5F1BFFB1
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0xF02233772CA8B44209BE30E5CC9108FE
torturing pain arose.
0x0FB643756341ECEE01D2400EF6B229E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x3D810B69C50E3B2C3C98784594F8D029
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xE3D8DF0485BFA30DDDC4F8DB18FEE0FD
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xC311E87A5130FFE4B0A19DDE43B14D4E
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0xB145E9809F10657881F056C6F7E94A9E
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0xC6282B6F4AF5D5E32A11DB1EA8BC2C7E
not charm him_.
0x482DBCDDD59FECEE760F03DDA907E001

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x3B896551B84481A3CCBA2D548EF85470
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0xE8B135A8BCAE3EB57DDDC63D21C90D69
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0xB3AAB42CD43D19250114E0040E8B7B88
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x8B4D62CA56FE788E1557612BFF84D54F
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x53429AF7CCD95457B81F8434158A6264
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x4C2480A05E2B76D255C6DCB6DB97C908
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x79251447877A05477355E78BBE07204D
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0x3B35E0E56A92B4F2D13D3031FDC0E02E
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0xB40BDA3E08D09F8856290CC75B66BC8B
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x7C0AFC18E082E59D9F0F08EEF882EBD9
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0xBBEC0B7E448FDE1208169D1BECAD2171
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0x5594CC27316846437E09163719D32759
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0xB6A7ABC5039E37401D244D7902B3D3F6
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x4FBFEFF3197FCD90EF3251847A94EA38
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x5C8F237EDB64C020A2EA44BD32DD551A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0x959ACDD669A2C8A1B8780B1EB30F615E
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xA83C04593EEC7A839338DCF75CB78450
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xA91E692DFC245AC4143D360C40E6E65B
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x374B82C5583D37390E824C51C88DEBB1
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x4A7EB48BBCD24D7E6704B4E24D4103C1
silent conquest might have been won.
0x7396C392D11C8EE01FE187189FD61B6C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xAE4315DA8D21CFF856A31EF3A22A6F5C
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x59017F70F4BB2BB58EF4F28AC579FF17
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0xFE746E400B38233A5BE6056F0C39C47D
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x7321B6B08122757B9455C19636A25804
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0x52834F8B59A7F75C00C8E76A26EB2291
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0xE90BD0A0CBF67F083F2610241590C7F0
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xF8D88FDB28B5C00F850E21427A8E1EB0
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0xE5E4C8F10DC6B984094C227BDC35E138
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x15E4EB459C7F863C42DAFD441BEE4FA3
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xE8429FFA78A373EFAB072C7206C70E34
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x45848D55B2FA400E45627CC9555AEFFC
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0xC5096BB172866E10839EECC881414CF5
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0x45C7B57F942F864531163ACC1712BA49
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x07D5D1578A72C3E3BB57F815FE6E2F54
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x7D4E20DA40B58770FF4972CC3A418DF2
shines on."
0x77297A0675B50F9B2EB1A194C5B7FC6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x2224A995B1FCFD451B1D2FA3C5072401
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x02B0DF6AA04959CF804E6A7C5FDA6C30
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0x0A0D3D22EFF9EFC5BC91AF4B56C00FAF
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xFD19357D6928ABB08E36278A4DF4793E
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0xCA37B1C73B195FB72C82C28B77434991
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0xF681C2A98D8A3D3A5E587AA860B9DE54
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x36681849624D69832E850056B86EDBD5
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x88211BF7BE1BAE1262CFB435FA2F53DD
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x267058E1F5E53AF651EB4229097DC316
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0xF54A270B36ED6F415FC6D03384A3A91A
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0x3959E1534F5CBFBB739BB8A576FBEBFF
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0xB54097987F934169829383BB46BDB051
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x5009B506201231D57380E9B14E89E158
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x1AEEED992CA9B2539D51E6F521CADDBE
as I wished to act.
0xBAC6895F67E1DB00BE3FC12158C0B00E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x7198346336895C33A8D51740D6212E7E
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x8580F6989909BF0160B7E0676BC8D2B0
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x920285294D8345F235F5EFFEC893C595
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x140F405C0699B0C9D22FC3D039258658
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0xA04AF794626961515B1F9C9B729B4A13
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x7A9253D57458EC09AC490B70E2A523C0
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x28FC93AA3B9035CF07D6DC7C260EB2D4
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x5FB84761C360789819F36F4A5FA832F5
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x359CCCA65FB211ED5D60818C72B417A2
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x518DCFC246232DD08204E97381A79A17
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0xF1C9B33C97CE0AFDD61B1E9F6BBED12F
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x6844A2184CFC791854DE11964C4C40FB
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0xFB7C2842D8888C4430553B1113697070
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0xCDDBE8ABF0A0FB63B063621AC9127352
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x10B527624AA42D199318252B716B225D
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x51B565F81452749396E6B015E6EAC540
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0xC960289448AFD55BC1E3ED35A333068D
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x8D5B3FE5104359FEA3CD66D150831ADA
nature.
0xC2F04B3E3FD137D535D6207BAEAE6845

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0xEB26CFEB57746B772CEDF29967B6A777
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xD2A6125CEA14CEFE404A4E96792CE054
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x4A6A5F167DBA17772328CDF5C4375D43
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x002778B040C225F5B2E825A2C96391C2
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x4ACB03D7AC35CC6F067219F3FB2BD73C
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x3599952EA7D39A999D8AB352C0BE8CD2
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x1169EF2998235A155B8247BB16C60249
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x67288C91598CDBFD89FB8F4887821B6D
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x2D40BA6F5D5BC1E2830FA8F3048374BA
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0x2809CA4B7764FD92C4DA7C4426D234E9
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x696A4D12C621C0BB39BD6FB636E75A10
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0xF5EE12EE853A75328BA6842397AC3D1D
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x92B60AFDEB9257744549D13B7143563B
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xCDA9C44DCDA1753C65A83D3F64595D43
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x1F608D31B6B5ABF43999DA65BDBF96B0
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x3134F036BBF3CB1D1F494BBA6B882B39
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x65C97BEA398B4B87FAAF737F6D91AC68
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0xECD4A3258F878EBFB8AD801C309292E9
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x883705A3BE6C2D89E932197C72044255
vivacity of conversation.
0x8E707415B21FA69E71651F2AE28B8894

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x33A610E58A39585B5B2CFEAB2CE7F992
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x3D87038C1C780800D0213063A2FF0BD3
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x7BE70F18C89BF5E674BCA0133DE83A09
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x047004CA916DCE21321455DB6F482474
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0xBF6D3AF2139E266271DE6A33198D9073
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x42CAB68A603CD916B77C5897A1A5394A
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x3A3DDB4D6FC4AADA154C082FF25525AB
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0x68F60263DF69430EAE5DDEF3E8E49496
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xB13CF864B695E0AD4789BB4D55B633A5
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xCC8A629389E9C05EC640A621277E73ED
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0xAA40D423D0942C763C5C8E481A74AEDC
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x29D7C61E58FAEDE9D0F5CB44B3DD6B02
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0xAFE1D7BC78EE9BF46338345388541F3F
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x2BE5E48745FE20BDCD1666E4493B3EBE
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x0F2EB1AE75FCBD049BF1E5564ACDB458

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x49D88D70665B4E27ACC33AB0A6F6D633
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xE0A0172129F3738B201586165E1F0922
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x205FFDF692CE1F04342EAEA0E34109E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x3C6C3115234B60ED0D76B998A5F3EAF5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xAC5AB38BADB09FCBBFE8ECD8CDD85635
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x9B2F8E707EF471CAB24931F177065298
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xE5F17EC719BDD5437BBE3890695FBBC8
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0xC53A740ED4B55F9CE0A1B44A91638850

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x22B6457FD03EFD82B5141DECC8093B45
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x8D5CB5FEFE4F546080AC88CC40DE5BA5
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0xB7FFBD7B5D31DB5B69B5AE5F1BB0B030

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x33D5559A4872DF252F5AC10ED4DF346A
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x32F16BE0B3DF7BF960B3911C2EB1CA86
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x2CEEFE2416DC0563B76192A3DE469F0F
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x1269806859CCEE9683A70F0AEEB7B2EB
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x8099D167DE8A4554887E1812AD6DA37D
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xF63034548BDE8F1521CAB853B75136B4
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x7184B62A396B565CD32B2FA1BABA7914

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0xC3C74702EE1E4C45E633538B473F298F
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0xA118453ECB3D94E310EF983016FE8408
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xDB880812CFF5544B26092EB844B49AE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x00CD8566B035A62CB4ACF63BD162C513
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0x498AFBBDA9D0EE4ACD2D95DAB6E3E3F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xAABC7A0C527462D76DEBDA58CF304A7F
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0xFC9818C78340D51DD9D5037FAD9ADDB5
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x8638F53CEA9676C2E380C50AFEF81BFB
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x3D808D99BB102DDB0251C0B7E603B500

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x74D6626DA1C76973BA6FD99FFF22D829
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x71443F31B35A6F8D254012AD8D52B971
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x4DE027156BC7E8A9B47A58BAC7044646
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x94D801500DC01F29D59CEDCF1A20426C
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x5E78A8DEC74450A2BE6CC4FEF0C60A1D
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x9D9DAC32F9908F3146C1E272007F12CA
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x940CD6969CBC01FF143CEF66027FFA4E
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x096D8CE2474924C34954DDF7C7AA2351
least so I thought.
0x17AD3EF23C744F22EEA0A251B18B64A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x657D5EF6A3EFA0555E62126ED1B2A7D9
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xB545C727A2DB3E85DBA3B611C93A02E0
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0xF63401EB7E8FD1587745D6B337749C8F
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xC17872BF47F8DB102C862AC17AB16C0E
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xC037CCD6F3590100EC95A3B933805DD5
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xD0797511D274E29EAE9F106E6E409844
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x4C881AF4422EF087BFC972A328A45648
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0xF506F1A6B33F7FEA26D4FB4892ECAFCE
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xCA853758640F5A2F659D48503B6E9D2F
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x4A768CDF7B72D4E458FD6B84E7324B71

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x1293D0851ED948B1C3A376C913B521F8
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x38F00257C8A2BF11CB25D71B8880CEC7
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x3A964FF565681642F29502696C91572B
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x8551F8F968E12828A5EB79D5DF0C38A7
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x8BFE6580D111505A057710AABFD095E0
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x4F4A61EB88921D00309DDD4DB7C0BBDB
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x5425794F11AF927CACFBA71AA0A04A48

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xA1C4519B26BA7D986EC5F228429103C0
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x19BDD91455545048608647A64EB8AD12
that "extremes meet."
0x219E1E7F0C15B72E1CEF1B894B810692

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0x84BBD60033523F251D56CCA02D39CC9B
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x7C60F00B21FED2D3C942F78C8514738D
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x3E66A8BB9989347C449819A9294CE309
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x845E754DD568C7A6AD1A42653AF40C6F
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x04C1AC89A67A8B7550D427AC6122417F
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x7199458FBC2D6B4E4E3D61C2334E9961
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0xE99067EA3238E83ABF22639B0D5D6904
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x450BE1CEC45B4B2748CA31E49AD031C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x76822573F7D20A464A023090B9852FEE
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0xB59C5D26BEE3310246028DD7E75F5667
a placid eye and smile!"
0x4B28EB6653D470759AD0AF5B673C328A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0x81226C9F3E7F577A3F76BB7168AB1EF4
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0xEF7DF8EFD504C56DCC95822772EB946B
Hay Common.
0x7D8771C75877AED099BC2852D7F8B98F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0xA3C6DB87A08D4BBEF56146D93F1E3F65
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x31927BBEC2CF012E4F677D2578E5485A
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xB179E937217F10A5A7446C6151894FFF
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x6BADA04BED03179DE4B0FD6577C9B18C
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x0540AEF8C0F3D5522A4CDB8F5B82A7D6
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xB0ABE4F1375B3264BB0EC661BF1FD870
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x3B0E0873DB7936D6CE80BE0BFA503245
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xCE36DD1E79EE1ACAA77959A391A5339F
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0xF09663D789B71EF14283A35B07EE45EA
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x1D6892E1A4E04FB81A18E32C7DD2F1B2
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x755F136E5FE486763958F0BB3DB3AC58
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xC830B5CE2EF72BFE5A747B0899C98571
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x7D4CA8D0F9810AB71F370AB4452D07FA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x3E20C00859C1450325D3E5786FA0C1CF
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x76BE9618512BD836F542E0894C1A3904
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x82EDAFC803E3B0713D26B05B47E53C37
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xEB2D3C91B6F0434DE85560A212CB5356
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0xF5A24914E24815726A11DF5941C41C1E
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0xDDFC028EEE26AAEF9A503833BD41DF23
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xDE3780201078E32492D6210D8A1FA3FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xB1B4589B662E09886DE174E9E172F696
off," replied the magistrate.
0x3D3CF0CD8307672F5A5466DB8F7A99EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xD564891C07E53A80D32BBC7B276C3C00
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0xE3C2B3E1F167DFB452FE4A03A26CF74B
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x396CDB9D0372CB28263C9AB8474BA5A2
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xEB57C28D713B13057F95824D24B744AC
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x14C59A430D34A68FDBCEE94DDC54D332
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xE041BB262FB7227CA4DB7C70B4F9C36C
see her?"
0x6310500502C2976480C0A3F3DE89DDEE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0xE3BED6E6F3C5292407D18E2893F82123
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0xD12BC2855AF3CBCA7658DC77CD0225CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x1DDF8D0EE3CED08F7F7AEEDEFF5BAB39
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0xEDEF0762B63F460D9E1308FE5752763A
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x5C7135A5AF9F2875C533EC0348541A23
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0xEC6C6343F641D22CE879FF7C15F3CC3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0xDD6D6E131B036DD5E4CCEA13D64BC073

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she

must and will do it."
0x58DE7E58BEF5C5FAF2CA72A453E7D7A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0xF1DD172F11B7E5D433A66AA11E850153

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x9852C54F8E66FA77AA373521F682FCF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0x24F0E7B944CAA71F9B1481D229C123B9
in, of course."
0x6738D6463EA5772D210D037339501A6F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x2BEA954EEC38F8B95A6137EB7570790D
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x1A17FE5C6F5FCD90729F1FCF175998FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0xE809F6C402A1E5EA8CE0CFEB26473102

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0xF5019100CC95606788183A0BFB565EE6
in the Dowager Ingram.
0x0F0F78EC672E822E5335DDE391864ACC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0xF41CD32A58ED9893C68677D4C983D762
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x8B3966C40C920526E1AE7DCDFE5732ED
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0xCF0772803180E579B0FBB4E337B41314
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x17985EB0DEC4EA66B0D152E81178CBC2
forward."
0x9F84F97EE10DF9D59088B7E823BC7A9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x7CC21E01B0189E9052F29A85A1513A99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x095ED9445AB8B0BD8D07CB0440FB0B9F
Sam!"
0x8A2502F5CAD3E7531F66B35386F9AADF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x9207DAB2F6FCCC5CB1F756BB98FCA510
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x49F382A01E462893056F41C56D45D471

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x08C265B78FC63BEBD865BED6E9ABFB73

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0xB74FCEE04E8A8D85D6BE32320FC77ADE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x7E41910B5FDD97A1E1375F7A71FC6CB8
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0x51EF76BCB94641953538E5BACAE2B1DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x711AAD18C3428948A82780C2B093B3D2
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0xF575B04A6FA266658141A65716544AA5
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x893451FFA5B34F9DAA19EC59D8081EAA
one."
0x78906119C8E0FAAF241B89A571A32986

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x860C0954772F1C5F03D9DFD230EC7005
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x201774E9001298EA22A5DABAF12ECE81

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0xC2EE4975B56E60E43F6E4E5840025B76
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x292784C5575EBF836B09976157F681BB
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x399AB7EF0324448EC12C411D802E0680

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x69E3274C510422564E7A6CC8F3658E43

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0x854434FE452A53C2A991B87856547CF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x259A1386C958BA0A34519493AE0F04D9
once more.
0x093F4FA1D55126639DA5E6C161E2796B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0xB03A158965CE0749725232AD3F78D9E7
know who will be her first visitor."
0xD4109B0A9F93E17AD87C5C08AF9660F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x5A2A0FD801248491D8CFAB63F6C187C4
said Colonel Dent.
0x2D04A08BF38385B18943E302FC3B33DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0xB99E59EAF94367B100C0232495228F72

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sam went and returned.
0x8C57E8D8AEB1B0780FFBD3992920582B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x03E4B07F72BCAC9CB19C0AADB8983634
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x4E2D12C333C22550CD397EAAB809C741
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0xD16EDB4C9CD0F7C9FCB797E47A9FBDBB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x7DB150F8A6D56EC73482EF9740BF9747

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xB749BB55020DE203E3150A7B8A35885B
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0xA8C9A9217EC41FB8A9D38CF213BC19D4
of his men.
0x44DD348B504E5D3132BA2B6B5512740C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0x472A5FF6945B3B0F2C0EC37268A11800
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0xEF2343ABD383924E433B43D3E27111C4
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x6BD911AB1A15B87964A6493EF19C816A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xE629EC4F6EF1E025C2159727F89C3DE5
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0xA28A1C9F0A7FF0C5C36E11C317933E0A
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x6E21BB9F630B7AF8071E15DC61B11291
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0xB337FBE8414ED37065A496F1CD8B413A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x5E2D3E14FC91784835DA98F62718594C
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x8E21CCBE99C5E8A23E62360882606D0F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x6EC3EF79B183F019746227E30D56D0A6
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0x7833CA7273C82291C46342A0B76050DE
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x81B4517C6DA54C2A0958FEB47807FE2F
her seat, and took it in silence.
0xC3E18B5014929EADBDEE5FD54F79407A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0xF97EA816688E93520E5E31D030FA423F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0xDF9E7460757D151DB61B48C6F3F50930

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xE4F12D7D61C1C5D4F3DE553D1FD06429
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xD9864F0698C2CF727DAE08962D0FEFCC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xB00A9EC8BDC452827ABB7C5C587E158B
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x1C024B375C9B4AD27521D657D9D68750
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0x78635F27E41525A9F587CFCADC919F4E
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x5DADE35ECC81AB2C095A9467599844A9
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x93AA8713E6FD67B079605ED0A23D97DC
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0xBAB5167FC02626BF24843B10EF887EFD
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x748D558080250C5ECAFCF6C758C3B067
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xF7890E33E5975DDA14C5275D1A2B812A
morning, as he threatened."
0xF893B0C1FDCA05A98FE6EA30DE533EE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0xA81876F15E72CD42B277AA8829489EC9
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x3B39A9E22A035251F051F6F0CB27249F
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x30C66EEC31783ABCAED50806414E4444
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x703F454AD452983AE66066186EE5A217
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x307E2072D30339B082B97530E360CC50
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x5031EBCC907D58B2DE4169A36B0D2FC1
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0xA0910B0A88F2EE5DF24E30FC020BE286
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xA8331929DF2A8514124BFFE6FE69AC11

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x6E231B318452EBA2522894D1F761E601

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x7229E5AD064ABE57BBC9BA1794BCD4E0
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0x2050AA6879A87EFC59BA7EF286114BE9
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x487849F2F05321D758AB2A40C1FE441D
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x4F2DEEBBD77F33F435031B7D16F3ADAF
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x66C659D8A536D8B79C9323D32606E5A8
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x425D024556E614FB1D2461BA4912842B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xEEDEF543DF2D0F919D6A09771752606D
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xCF3F730D1B6E3D7DDDD561026E377ED9
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xA21FC5A37274EBBCB964F6D87CC911C6
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x0D30350835385E080B90083613C71326

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xBC345B8C8ED7429115D7553E6A89E937
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x62F6BD071986A87B1A28B9765BCF3578
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x960F9BA56F883FE9A0F08589608E87E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0x5BE9F79C817C8F30EC33C8B7327F265C
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0xB222B156ABC4F2D8C7DA3DFCE367E514
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x648CF684E6F7EAFB68792233BCAA32B5
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x9FE3690200D7C245F6D5B53F8F150395
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0xD3FF0C45A9B81DDE743BF6D8D40D9324
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0xF94AB8146EF01D4D5F57828AE0F10551
they most wished for.
0x037FB99A35CC904AB5D60DB458DE6E60

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x49C798FD4EE08D9C683390977AD63C2D
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0xF40D372359598D6218AD35DCA181F5C4
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x363CC7CA4CB07C2FD6BE2921399E6174
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xBA14B2208247479B2DD650D5A7A72937
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x1E0BA49311514517E4BE788CFC8F68CF
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0x54AB08D58BD6564DBE341EEDC3431430
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x2DBB8D33C65087AE69D301CABD55D4B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0xDB94FC722604B46A398A102E64CAB105
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x595BF7186BAD192F32849DB145B11BA3
saw Sam.
0x3A24C15AF82308C68A1911624B54F4B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x73D5FD9154CD56DE6CA0D8B9A90A5DE7
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xCE0D6CAE1208B32BADF9ECA2FD0DC7CB
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x15565B4AAB6ECB42C46BE6E54D85C3C3
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xD373CE578E72CEC36E696F2213E163E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xB5A94A1FDAE8675C582DB5CA8B50E0D2
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0xAADAD4FBAB241FF3C243D8E674AAE95D
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x02643963F227EA9CAFE56C7019A05E83
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xA988F278C6C693075EF54D8483ABF21D
quietly behind me.
0xEB535A2B6DC8ED67BC3EAA2A3904E39C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xE6862168D244DC3BF3D5723D2CEC4BA1
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0x1927F3D0ED8EF3767C3D3653CDBA2705

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0xDA2F7D3ED00BA6425728898BB243AE4B
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.

The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x0B6DB0F3C7D249878AEEC53F7A6117F8
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xE9A14F34F7CB5FEB625631D078C12CE8
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0xF2D9E0531B9777E9C7AE63B772EE4E4F
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0xDAA2E58B18F5C326E75C31F357E4F0E0
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xEFF6F19CCCDFD3CA4C06EBFD07B42F8F
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x900E166F79B72F84EA96D0D70FC77973
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xA9CE5E1606F0CC6BD73765F329201328
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x64E3ED7CA4EF59E15E56942931D0B79C
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x8EE69336D2160440F49E4864A0EAF596

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x6BE1A3584E14FE0B49129D17F6BDDA6E
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x2BC17348C4838F9471C916653D0A010C
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0xC232EF541F3EB54BCCBA14B9C1152AD0
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0xA0ABD1F9BBE61B0555EED0DA8639AC7C
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0xCDE36314A0AE51414C9F2F38699E786A
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0xF325F436B9C5B856D1E09003ADD9093D
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0xEE83BCB5A6A01EB8CBD8F6760BE87E95
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0xE139A88E7877D3C08F0C9E3C7236D582
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0x1740A15106FAD3423E72E83CBCD51F6D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0xD54A2FF4770827FB1DEB31E8EDD6B720
as her glance, as harsh as her features.

The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x3F45936222E60DC938175661C07AA249
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0xA65D505010DDBF7B449CB8E9BFF46E00
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x163A134D7617325E5E2834EEC50959CC
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x85F095E8F8B3F8137416F5F4EF1DCCFF
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0xA3E0FF316062086CF8C277159CEC60A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0x8A05D81523DB593DCEDBD22C3D598D05
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x06164EB7D0533D015A2F957AD6FAA24E
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x9ADB0E9B18FA9A562EDFB878762E21D5
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0xA183B4723764817C4002FCBF7394945A
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits

you."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking

with vigour.

situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials

I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x28C5BB5865372ED43A0386099B17023D
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0x194189EC55F2470F2D9D189C493D5F6C
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x23374C1881CDE5C1899965BDEBED8DF1
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xB8BCBCC2260ADF667FFA86FE14B64094

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xF57EC34827B620A0943E4E99D2705040
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written

there."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x73D1BB72E36FCC0BBC84E6894723C228
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall

begin to put some faith in you presently."
0xB1CF37E781B572B104773C16B0CFA342

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x04238998AC06E8CBB62B2C8072B84747
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x5920069287FD657E962390CBEFC6CEF2
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0x4B4A94EFE2E22F40D26738ADADCC7B48

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x90D44C9148AA5E5FF5121CD8D89E9AED
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x8BFFA4C5680B77C5ADA768C74D2CD30E
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0xA348A37DC12D053AF73D5F4FBCF82CE8
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x2FEB3C74906C10BB7B9F73422F476B6F
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0x7024D5EBACA576A4E00AC80A179A3B39
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."

whispers of the future?"

interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0x83EF197DEE9CC2FE55414AEC073BC16B
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0xD8DF62756878958D88D101D08CB8F3D1
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0xB93A24F711694C2DF9A1E1A0DC79D37F
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xBCDC4185D72B7D22EB7544A709E91597
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0x9048A8BEBAA2DECB78A2B710C4C487D1
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0xE11CA8210209E5AB2F32E5694849978A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0xB6F77373675C5FD08CFB00A0A8D1B2DA
signify?"
0x1FB5F513DD70CECCFFBE3FD8E18784F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0x42DE553839B508A100B78F1AFEE831A8
now, I suppose?"
0x7AF47E09EFDC614B247A58E17ECF6B87

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0xD16ACC32FD3D7E3EB994CEE007899063
yonder are doing."
0x0C3222C63433FB4809C17436B51F4489

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0x0195455647007BDE618DFB50E8AEE3CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x00E59954B196506D46E229FE89C0369A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x85A826DCBC5DC1EAA0280D4C5D2B6A53
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0x8C727FF1373501060E71F63CF513FCF5
left this morning?"
0x5DF6F18F16F8F84C059AF40238552A38

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0xFC57333E76262F82973331F8080BB9D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x0F67858BAD49901DCB47B241C69BB7C1
installing himself here till you returned."
0x89B41D3873F5FA1E702ECE9FD5D83B8A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x4F1B791626AE68CD2F82DA7B164732F8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x9F70FF876DBA56C64C35E1E171FA5B21
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0xC94CCC8B8E2D9651F0B6555A98E7AE9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x37C99313FFAA77C9E6931091DDA87C19
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x6AC5DB802EDDF16C84274B6D9ACAB5B3
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0xB44AFE80B3D001651A25A05432100F66

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x971D604276258F364DCC2308C7621A99
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x39FAA76E95346EDC2F4A1F7CDD8CE605
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x567006F32D538BC17E6A10A47B2578BB
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0xC66B33DE3857C8EB9AFB6746F2B237E5
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x80F9A449C093306585806EBC36D28CC1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xC996728A078572F17A4716282419087B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x271B818C5FCF3969B1362A68F076C9AA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0xAB3E86450CDFCF6025280747A4716377

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x2A678C34687E4B0AB0A1A230FCE1FAE3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x162E0FCC76D2FAB96AA93BC90DF5C0ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x969EC9394C05E99AA17158B6B9C7EE1A
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x77B0B901262F1A810E65B8BA9B707BC0
and dreary look.
0x6E71FC2E593D49C8F4E903B613707E2D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x97BD3657F9CA04072DE7C96E4EE67C9C
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x9F7CE6379C7ACBC6BAB69DAE480C2327

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0xB8966F8A77B20FCEB6774537CAB9481E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0xB490337B86AE2D1E831F2B6D9636B6A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x8B70190EE40207097F132748BC0C183A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x53C4A6250C43040DBFEC07CFBD570CDD
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x0C45A73444C09B6615E6960F04DF289A
doing."
0x2D4EC24AC826AC24C769CAFA1465D3C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0xA249A9300FCF907CC559033F05283A81
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0xA9F7BD985015A777664BC10809DBBDBC
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0xB72AA74E72504D88E0DEF4258F8508C8
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x844D55366C0E0559CDDFC06690DAEDD8
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xCB0C8DC5B3C2061E93371F9F0224EEFE
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x7692E5E3CF712B3749F1CC6DF5628979
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xDAE46E244C4A6B15D62D227F9E26F453
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0x7075801AE85F381ECC779B6590C7E15B
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x72F96E29B58C17DEF5B0580D6CA2E7D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x0694E3F1B8DDC626612770D405D371D2
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x09E1FEED95150F0A44C2B2983CEF4BF3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x1DD9F457A6908BE9338C42004E447C0A
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x05CB8DAF8771DA8D6E9642132B2FF568

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x0046B2B0495D51435AAB4CDC498C7F4D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x76294B22C1D3942B70FA6BDE61140C4F
strange?"
0xA5A3DE9B17A0B0661A70B63A7A526102

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x90A67FD5AE13542BAF34B8704CEE604D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And Mason?"
0xEF2744C573918E2B1FEEFE008773F0C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He was laughing too."
0x137E758E3FE263A4AF8C97C2FBA84E00

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0xB60A0021E5521BE4632AA65E1131B188
Jane?"
0x19BE90966A776C1BABD54B6DFBE36326

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0xFE132DEDE0D8D20923A37254284C1BDC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0xDB0D376D82A4E5410C67D57B1B407CDE
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0xA383B695E263C1C3BF25B6562216B9A3
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x021699A3F66B7B8B0EB176150D773C99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0xDC53B636A801A65EC09DB383FDC0457C
you."
0x9ED21FFA9B42DD84B704DF1AD8C5B314

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To comfort me?"
0x2344D36EFEC81661C9406CC95CCDE698

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0xD69634681069739AAE11322DB8775768

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x74CD608E7C2FDAD198B78645BE82B239

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0xC5101689E540F7F7A4F62C05CB512D4D
care nothing about it."
0x649F3A07A1EC1CF917C822C0C2E02AA7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0xA58E4639935277FA63E340788735A000

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x9E9CE2273EC4A08EABD47889C3466B8F
you, I am sure, do."
0x3D41B43EB3E68AE56E0840E102864F78

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x2D4D51F5DAF13626D1076680CDF6AF2A
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x0BD490C95D0B10686D8AF5EC78F07CF5
and then leave me."
0xBD8CF4A6E8A0CE4BBCF224531616C0E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xF473E0A21F4A169B5FE44382102390B6
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0xF3ACEB2EB3F995DD8126B5D8202313A9
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x2A76DF3A179FC560791BF9AAC4E33CB0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x8C203CAA59B21E3C2F10A588D799FEA7
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0xB70A7BF98E5A86D1D1EE789209FB740B
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0xA21DF6F7FE4CE941D209E1C08121C1F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x4785C2DBDEC2BB53AD4010E1E32BC3B8
asleep.
0x8F4C15FFD537DDFE92E854FA9FD01007

CHAPTER XX
0xF25B13B4F155E93C2733A204C7B2E8A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x60F06761B846C0C6A9C5A661F433531F
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x246D943220B13E883D11490CD520C0AA
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xDA255B4C31FEFE9ACB6581D56941F4D3
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0xB4BEBEC4E759F7657DA33FBEE807302D
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x34722DD76A44AF4D6A6B0ABBEFDA70BA
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x5CF4932EAD160C0D96FC287DCF54D1A0
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xC1E029AF02E66B07BEE8430918829998
the curtain.
0x09DF9F981801117DF089A7B340C6AEB6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Good God!  What a cry!
0xBDBDC2BEA47440BCFCEAC7B0171D2510

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0xFE801C2CCB0CF28ABD4332CF89787F0A
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x9FDDAA747CF716FA3D861B33F681C7B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xEA97452BDD17B89681B3C784726B485E
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x6AA0DE3295E74BE2FE868E00B5215629
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0xC6CCE4844CF54ED8BC3806DAB5B2F4B4
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xA4CE508C1575BB31738D5A5E6FBD3D9B
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x47A4151A34A843F90C107A20AA176BEB
it could repeat the effort.
0xAEA8D5EF9AC2ADD78492ACC122BE398A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xE97FE32C38F6EFC979D13EB54A9A7D82
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x905812BEC6A42611648D8DB6CF79EF6C
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x4CC6413C25FF946D2D231E66B0680E46
voice shouted--
0x54C78FD9A38CEC6D7D8949CCF8D164F6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x066F7242194E335E5915E3A959F71E31

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0xE5B500A08F2A7B91FA3CFF0AD9E746FE
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x5050A9E6F3B1CE56DBF1E89EB6BDF2D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0x367BA5626D39CEECA89FA4ED8368CED7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xD14A4347AEBABB354E6356220ED7FDE5
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xD799FC2E5E3CAE33167B49BB0DFCD00D
was silence.
0x5C1DE21EEAD62381B1DB4F818BF2282F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x348D3147F41B8B754BD8C46546F015DF
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x02D3E957BBFF6334CBFD1CA4D30FC43A
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x9762D2E00FE38B330FDCDCE67638AD6D
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0xE1DB62D5265F179116FF5A24C691B198
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x2F4239FAE28381FEF48577D08ED9AC43
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x7496572314F5E2606A0BD7129195A514
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x6FBB97AD7C4F77CF09C6DBF20C5C883E
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0xDC6035A2E687DBA55DE92534B31DD5C6
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x2E00B411684F121A660B2A79FB03F61C
confusion was inextricable.
0xFDA1B7A0DA3C78A648A00A5830F0DE5D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x6288918394C957B267CE2E98A4630998
in his bed."
0xE6A25C1E511D716D6FEC46B4A1170054

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xFDB2770C3157F6CE4933703A3AAAB812
coming."
0x443609DE54BAE7696E2E06058281333B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x0A092FD9F4A80C3C0C8C65B1B3FD48CE
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xC3AD4130F43C18E0279A3FF7C0486C92
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x6CC88BD2579361A59B6098B51B4AB178

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x91388FD666BFF476C03EF01FBA99BF81
worst at once!"
0x5A217EFB9F4C8C04FE743740CCB6C169

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0xE103FA5DB171CA376BD3DFEA034285C7
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xB3935AF5A7905AB6F684BFE79E69487F
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0x2F70995DD221D0E7E0FF4D7CE5273FAA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x8D094E877C58ED01ABA734FB25BB6ED2
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0xB2DC62ED9D5C766AD8FCB9BD418AD6E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xC6A14B04E2879962E81F1F8B55A77349
by an effort, he added--
0x77A929A0B5957FBFBC71B7A4F23615B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x1643C4EADB339D7A80CDE2ABE89F4427
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x124FD2166F6F46C5F846A80E70822EA4
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x0A9165B05678D4F07224B6CE1D818E2A
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x71530777EE0A57BAB264E7922C4508AC
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xAB844719002CA579DD14D33E00A0E7D3
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x8A003F380BDAD8C29EF39E79A45C84BF
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0xA7527DF1587F72ACFA50CB46D1320BD2
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x35C826DC5472A764996F45019F3A4676
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0xCA0E83B00388491311CBAA87A043B7EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0xECAC7FBDD7C290035458BA7AE9EC1A28
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0xF4BD9A624C59578AD7A4B5FCF18FD2EA
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x4B895BF641A86ECECD4C64753D2717EA
had left it.
0xE9B34B4654DF00EF174E0D8D59FB3423

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0xE18CC6E9915EC5B902BEE17333A110FC
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0xD0BE2FFAF9E80C648BE676AE56C6C250
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x09FA021B8292278D02078A63C234E6B3
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x65EDB21CBA21315BB4E383BDF870E0B0
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xE36B6CA26AF156AC3ADB9CA0F25D2361
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x9D535125A6999993B9299DB2A10A9187
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x6210758B837C99AD7A2017AD9163F335
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0x9167E14F319794596D96948426F61BB2
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x34261D0809474A56FE3F06B68DCD7912
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x3D7DFFBE2A327FBB0AED14A79100B3CB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x212700F5E6E862EEAE88DE1A8D7F50C3
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x87D99961665F0DCE03DCE6D6FFA004E8
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x4D84D8A62E61141138B93E2B6CE046EC
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0xEAAE0CA34D67BB7CCDA567ADD2310372
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0xC8F59D1C3D7008169B76F92FC3C18FAE
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x76D186E05A1BBB76BCE9CE430ACCA727
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x6AE1B05A238AF9D9004051898D6746C9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x14A30BAEED3F97295CCAC8381D308B2C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x52DCF5DE570384C375821106132C913A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And dressed?"
0x97037904A77A1C5B68B5607EEDF95592

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x0EE448F6637990F55AB29B78CD32130B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x18E797AE42AF8AC8C3F023BB1E1026D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x033E64345FD96FE67DD2C7095AA21487
noise."
0x8807A0E014EEFB85A84BFE55CC665B76

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0xC745356845F31600ADA7CF283822F3A2
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0x762DE13D92BB3FD5EF4E2D2EDD57965C
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x1FA7CD61F073EDF4C8DF9FAE1B32B596
side.
0x00625B0DFEA35258A618BBE02F51E2CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0xB0C77564FAE5828D5A5BF6D1CD9EDE8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x623FDB2B25107EF1A00D71AE411E4FA9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go back and fetch both."
0xD4BDB708DA2BCD846FADCAEF2FFF6143

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0xA7B210D0B5EF53EA8289083A824870FC
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x97596133DAAAA4BB1F7C7C0A66F16C34
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x313028746FE7968E7E8C178F98A2F3CA
he paused, and addressed me again.
0x04D7961281A7F1F4EF45DBDF300D43CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x1358595FFFADAB29CFB96C04E4774349

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0xA77074ED4C76A5C2CCB5510503F45342

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x6AEAC323FB823187D0D53E53C924FA1F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0xA560E742736B68C777148360E350D492
fit."
0x77B71369484BFA3F6AED57BA5843110A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0xF4A54AD43CFD15627F84E0C10F129206
the key and opened the door.
0xD51F2767DE9B2079F88BADEAD67605AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0xEDA47C660700C99FCE627CCE2DD89DF2
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0xDC741879CE43F599DFD4D1D441C48C64
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0xE22B74929D62EA653C3CC23ADDC04DE5
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0xDEB38D46FB6C98A981C90E4A039E1F6B
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x5C3741F610B3E5815226882D106FC5B5
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0xE778CACF13326F3D9DCCEA5A22A61910
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x40EA8338DC4B6F3754B69F22D1D2BA72
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x5697D2B6148307C408EB851472E5CC1A
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xD9B9D7BB5480D4D7FE7004EC78D03739
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0xFF60B831607104C9DAA1BEADEBFAB504
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x2CD2BF28153465C53324C78D3C4889E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x8BF1549221A0AF1C5C7A680C7928C48B
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0xB8FD1313262FBF57CCF081B67DDF7A74
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x74A5A4926632D6C9D1F8BAA605392FB4
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x411CF0A5B4968E6BA30D47D8FEFF2C10
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x75D8BAA0AE337EA677DAA650AA54BB66
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xEC6815757A373C7442B952F56392F940
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x729AE62B28A21D827AD7469A31E007AE
blood.
0xAD28384822FBB827915C62146AAF5680

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x342E7D14BB7BE0530C6BCB24B95AF911
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0xBE98F6C5B0B1613E214217C32D218AB5
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xA82EEB06821EFEA9E4C4EEBB59B78FDE
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xA0AEE843C06FDEBA44AF33AFF765E945
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0xEAB4A640C5E56592CD023D08EBD991C7
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0x248530B6DCE7816AE52AE9094C40D176
blood, trickling fast down.
0xD8A80C557913031549D0C1D36861518A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0xF5FC434F465E3BAD6BBEB7E42B79C75D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xACDA72B6711C305C02075D5A3A59AF81
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xD0656278415FC07AA931FC288FC3DDBF
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xD97E92AA5FBD9258D7EE169E506322E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir?"
0xE3B033EE0D23185A2866A6392CCBEA15

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x01DD419E1EF6B6AD5350FF138268016F
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0x7006A0813E13E35BCC47B5124F26982E
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x403F20F7AEC2922EC6526AC793C9590D
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x7139506DA369EEBD942FD0415C4DB7DB
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x2667D17AA2A27D860F7A3E781D0F9153
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x234FC424686CDBAE6F2CF703F8C82FB4
consequences."
0x633A84E1AACBF870426AFB191D8BAF8D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x4FB57B21887F8BDFB9E18DED3D2B1538
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0x0C3DCED5042255D9A0BECEE3A69EC43E
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x61096262DE416777DBFFB68B06191084
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x8C35AD7FF0E763AA9E56761D7002DFE6
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0xFC79C910427C0C7C53E807C0CBA34C67
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x84B04B4346B5DB8327297A049365D45C
step ceased to be heard.
0x746BAF423D9D348583889A157E9F826B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xD314EF874D5E4F5A47C6C630F450BBD9
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x61E35B630F8E4A74DD2B2678C03D4A86
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x2B49CDD53AB3981A02724CB19C320E1E
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x3399E824FED5D0FB5C06FCA0BE345B23
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x7E76CF034B648512F2C763FF625B783F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x8E903E8173857B4193A5E5B4D63D4871
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x54287471F79E3297DC18B4901909EA34
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0x7BB3DA7D78A0F075166ABB07545864CA
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0xBB943C59702ACB10838D0B4F68FE00D0
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0xB2DFF688A0FBD8D526716FF50ECA5045
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xD6E7360E3606F7EC15F75FB70684AAEE
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0xF6F286B8C6B62E9820A8A249862A8A48
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xB671C7348F60BECEDBCCB2ED4F036E1F
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0xDCFA22ED4C267D5195042FD182F187E1
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x7E47120383408F5EBA8F610A6A0C010A
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x6E3E5CAFCAB134E3B692E74FB47631A4
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x7C078B1953AE2F9D1C00DB3173583C80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x8A2A2E57B840D21B21533BC11F53D4BF
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x3A2170D964CF70547A736AD9AB9E5C15
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0xB204A2804BCA3C1DEA0122246B746C03
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x8FCB1A1EF28D269A824B4E6B3D738F6B
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0xEA77E777531854A00DF069B13C111709
subordinate's form.
0xE06E2C0581480FCEE718C8ABA85BB71E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x19E99A024C212EA70B0D278B8AD8A3C1
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x72721EBC73D4A5266594FB3138D6ED74
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x793EAA26B8516E83382FF098DB7A9387
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x1B9FE85E9C395E699FC2BBB73CCB3EF0
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0xB2989EF2AF711FB990A8FFBC96521602

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x3F0A229B14179A486C323CDBBF0153BB
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x9C20A33F66B97A5BED5E64926397EA72
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x83E34A87780D3B15E4C6EAFFA5E83747
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x786ACD28E12FA427BF84E912C35A1446
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0xF936265D2A379B4D9E4CAFC1B53A8EA3
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xEE1DA6AD2895E3D6549AF84D04009D6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xE9D81B4734741FA88AB293A92C24ED8C
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x2C1C9E5525355F676422CA6CCA18CBC0
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x93B746B62E38BF669B57C18FE3BBA493
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x29BFE09E834A1207ECF7F974D6E99BF5
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0xDC8DDEB2E6E5A649B72E9F137B6429BD
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xC391C196EA21798AEBDA9671A3B703BD
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0x78BC1EB4959A39018028F9B300C9129A
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0x8096F612C1B21FF8355BFA4650F5A91A
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x6773EFFDE2B4A0FE3C2B73182BA10F60
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0x569F91ED8E91D0C19D6A5178FDA8F3CE
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x2871459FEDCA4058254EA1D3E410DC30
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x7A0DFC274A02F44F9C264D4F5668B2B2
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x7DC95E85ECC0CA287C9A4915F4E90CD5
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0xEF4C3DF2C3854F65C43CEF8E25B3297A
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0xA82E348000EBFE43433978F1391869E8
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x57785C62D17B793070937C7844E6B45D
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0xC68BBACF9F10422F3DF14ACA4FE44AE2
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0xB5DF05EC18D97E399F68C4D610CC97F1
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x3E31C385DC8D02D52984ACC678843E7D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x69B3407E738927852B9A09EE545FF092
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x1C086B28ABAE3A6FBD6946BC8628E00E
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x3F053BF9D7E45208EC21900183700A3C
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xEBAD113D06499E2209F8E4EC7C10F4B6
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x0417B666026D1E30F2C81E234FD100A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x2B4AF8589A478E0F402B73011B3ACAD1
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x2001FA1DBB4E5C8DD844E9FC69AFD6EF
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x7EF3F6969D2D33D5EBEB49ABE43EB6B0
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x26DFEEC78E66A25748E3ABE4CE0EB277
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0x5576921F8704DFB7B53288718B94E6A5
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x09AD985DD0ADD65704DDED98AB8EB0BA
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xB0DA3D1A82C0F1AA118027A86471A598
I might not even speak to him.
0x3C14275F4B92D141B5B5557049B82EED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0xDB87E8A2807EBB2C9D81B8663C5492F5
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xF2FA2943ECC9C1BA868CE299B2A2B0F1
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0xFAB56B7E6E946BF2E53B6387591A7518
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x3C433F0435D27647C25E28E5A0E10F09
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xE4ADE0327EF3619E42CE0725BA2DD12D
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x2DC4A01BDCDEDC33355E859348B45564
shorter.
0x59BACC953C287D8C620CD47595686D79

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xA6A3FBB7EAA37F5CC27D2F32B7F2748E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x8C1EA2FC3FE803BABC95F3D0FA83A101
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x2F3D490D6FA20399D0559456B2C0ABD1
patient downstairs and all."
0x7B856C5D2CF4AE1525CADAE735C67FC1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0xBC4761CD460BD7055BB39B30F9D62DB8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x432171C417DD3F348CD1388BFD10A59E
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x91B2B897177B30FC2EB84A56546F51C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x6469E017DB5D3292F6862509329783E8
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0xCB950E00129F6FB7479DA595777B5332
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0xE81A8867DEC10C213F67642DC9E096FC
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0xE428E678F431BA6A0FB2A03E059DB62D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x8EB12FC154DF40B1BBB1B3788666B8CC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0x7D011471943B99F3DF9214F3BD13B4D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0xF1338F1FA174AB233616C23E1B42E879
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x2EA75B1D51D8ED58A4D5B3EFE0DEECA2
there's no danger."
0xE8810AC4FBCD5107C1B7A2CCC32F86AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x979D734B331AFB82A417E73B551BF1E1
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0x460940B791FB2E2C4D8930D522F5B83D
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x026A998C114811815942390AE3C3F856
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0xCCFF3F1DB8914F41D6E61925EFE17C8B
here!"
0x83C0EF821A39DF21167757AD9879CF71

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x967A8B4E2878C5ABE7B331FB67942F95
Rochester got the knife from her."
0xF11A76521D033051F402EE4D839ACD3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x45A7462071A041C7D67B87B3B74EB974
said Mr. Rochester.
0x30F8622A39A52AAA0BAC83C74C2E00BB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0xCC958AC136CCDE052B6F46C12109BF08
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x2FDB40CC0DA4D100179AE1EF735074F3
looked so quiet at first."
0x0C8E27314412AE054E1F8AE5A7D9B93B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0xDA201AF4AFB847A1974C067F50578ED1
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0xBAAD957064916D7AD38AC26FF118A16C
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x32166D88867D66D7C43CF580B5D27DC7
alone."
0x52C3C4644F1FF51061AC56D3AA175968

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xDFABF54E358F7EF96D43D1011E078450

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x797172EFA558A1D61D8EF96697077659
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x7FBEC74731A582A22A10E824953F70FA
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xEC95F982C292796E7A8174BB97DDAE8D
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0x12D68090667E60B4556716D5B609EE4D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x35853AECECF9018AE205279B2CD373CF
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0xE834F04DCA311D0BD215E8167D501605

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x021AE26831D9F3F01C2DFBDC8E90DA03

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0xA6FD00810618DEB2D1C1AB53777981AB
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x5721A92CA04FA4671CC48297D69F41FD
said--
0xDCF95D24795728D92DCC8E0069262D13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x7BE2312F78125FD51994BC320EE3ADFE
it."
0x2493C529979479ED0BC6DC3577A55A81

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x54E2EF05CDCA9845DF4556EDFC7CF75C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x1EF9E3D5E75CE4B48E6447244242413C
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xB196ECF790677E74A1E010CBD7FE95FB
think of her at all."
0x456367156486ADCC661F8F2B83D1685A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xC455C5EEB900671A705043B75B2E74BE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xABE64A05D3919AF99D49D46E1716B46A
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xC8B6F996FD972C32C57F0888A20F56DA
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0xD253B4507C3E12D03B24F5B2672AC195
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0x7E88545013E96BCD78C1EC0CE60AD8B4
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x916A97B18AD1F0EDBBFFEE40EAB3A69B
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0xCB66A12FC7C18747E1FF1B8C89F137A2
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0xE29AA3C7D223ADE0EBA9FA9AA84C6CCA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0xC6FF636106C70CA1420C556D6B736A5E
and returned with them.
0xF0C7F75FD50084CBCDD03FEB73A17A13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xAD448E6EFE1A12EE1019B79D4B11D157
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x7DB6C0D55422F7F75F1E0F504516E955

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I retired as directed.
0x3952E854F0C0ACBEA5C9A656F6F99557

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x0282434EE6BF26F947B3152F1D1E6339
Rochester presently.
0x795D85C2CD7E25B0849B75FDFA7A0E0C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x7B9B9CCB76BA5F1B042127702966EBF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x85F9176519F39CE75D89F1F91C2ABDE0
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0xDB0B77A22150D6CB8F7393BB9C2900BE
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0xD249FEEB4BFB1BA8D724CFDDF20E2387
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xC282E86C7F3CE4C3EDB89090FE959A4D
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x2E9CE70564AC04EAB88710ECBE6F0E27
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0x66A344273BA0FF78ABF3D7F2EB6AF1B9
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x088D9E3DDDA564D0FBE75ECEF351AD38

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x20412B28D6DFABB5C08E2310D3EA2DF2
edged with fur.
0xE621C41590D87E2AAA2C7328D811A36C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0x8333E5879A73BFE9A7AE9C83EAECB6A3
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x5EF5D8AD0746C124A55FB632DE524519
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0xC0EE996C34D340358D272633FB9040C4
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x7E77EB12AFB1B1620E8CEA9056605B2B
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0x57618A747C9A7227F162626EB6FAB341

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x3D863B3B0E558509EEEC88D7B9EF60D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0xC7F9D3CD862FD1D0CA54C35554D53167
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0xD9E61615F4B9CA1E3A25A68C240DB8CF
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x7B3C3CC1B4D2B630C0DAE8A5063E6BAC
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xE8B4F02A300D01FD3912BE0573C852A0
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0x81CCB8BAAD342E58BCD1C8F61266C8F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0xBC6316D208A9F8059034471C84066A1B
the washstand.
0xA21B22F354583B5400FA41FBCA860A17

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xFA3C927F9855C587F26638C0C98D32C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0x5BBC45961E72F1138DAFD93926CEFF3A
to Mason.
0x38A997FAB635A5EBBECC5BFDA44F1DA5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x1092B5A60741A4B1A91E4890DB3B46DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xAB1DD99A0CC7CA33E63C2D55C1DC6AC5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x52A5321F0647AC1DAAC146A0F38287A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xBC06CCF22E3D79A0E8991DD30DD7917C
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x8C6AEBC11F04593EC60EA042634617A0
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0x2A978726521BDAA282DDD42438C9E671
liquid; he then took his arm--
0xB1BA052DE0A3BB07F47912FC7FD4E452

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x39152A263B0254D216ED08E6EBA6DAD7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The patient rose.
0x2852D40BE354E9924E151E5DD4EC8D3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x3F8D7A77A008D301FAE29325B879AB65
step out--that's it!"
0x09DBD7A9E8743FE71EE1F211705A9065

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x4E1B2207E149A43BEDB398EB5FF70C33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0x5F58ABFA2832A306BB5F1880A027F05E
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x64D7795CC78A480A6A273C9F718F4A04
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0xF1224561414FB5A1132EF11D9F769FFE
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x2D230FC4D41A1B352C7DA1CE5A08F771
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x66614C5C51754300375C21AD73CB5A22

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x7781144442AEEA045039969D2CA0869F
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x52D11738398D710073AA458FE4836904
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x7D73855FE49D4D68B97683C9274C7EF2
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x17A35848C44F3CE960B3AD88AF01B579
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0xB4DE1AAE7C05D4836C5072ECBB9A90AB
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xE4114E6ABE16649C62299AE49DDB85CF
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x347C7E1F1A877E46DC763C66753D140E
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0xD12549EE356E29DB59740D2F29FD591E
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xBEC758687FF5323B5AC06433D6757505
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x174C1D36CC735C7A3EC2E2E3667D1252
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x4A7FDDD1EBD84ECC2C484C6341606C7C
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x8DA06A23F15E86B7A11738BA01424E91

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x2D500F4ECDDCD19EB82B4C9488C7F677
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0x9653A6E2E437575823EE5CC725399FEF
chaise; Carter followed.
0x82159EE63B2526F1E7936BFBBF37EDC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x3FBCE471A71C53D6FB8BC73F735B13D4
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0xF4361AF024F720AFEDAD391B83246693
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0xD55E09F7FA8EF0AE4C737FEED6BFD48D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x12819882C6687D17A5773DEBF8A0E6DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x209FBAE3CA918C52B9D781C81807746D
Dick."
0xC473E8B2C0DFB45E41661F19E138C5F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fairfax--"
0x43F32A35C3518E0F24A8694B5F0AA897

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well what is it?"
0xC57B1526B797F33071501E2CD4EB0280

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x835AD5627534975BEF2C7E61EFF2E8DD
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0x1E92F9EE075D798372BE62B54DF61C59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x94023BB30221BAC79215B61541FF7B6F
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x0AA64776514DB511FCDD186D3A8B64CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x656E512B587C4E72DE4FB3F7C90B84BD
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xA885E7197E5440FF4DB4ED784812D39A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0x41EF0D5B6F7ACA71E5D06406ED7E049A
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x89673286DAB68EE46CC9A8F36FA43BCB
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x4BB3AD9E680D3AC5759A4FC66377F7E8
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0xF9BAEEDFF00BFB527FD36D7CE815C657

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0xA3D36EE62CF0BC18100D1E40FEAA11A1
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x0C1620FEE488C7A3AD0CD788DDA72A9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0xE29CF43B81181BA9E388BF4113252905

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x7281C3C428851EDF00221B89DAD0B0F6
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0xC7C8DDDFD3B04B31FD7EE804C73E827C
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0xEB0E745B833351D92C8FA8F77C34F989
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xFF68BADFAF8F892BB338B9E2F624E8CF
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x17153C49DC2739C1923704525F3EBE2D
pure."
0xD8C2337F9E2DFCD44A09B3C689399447

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x1EF5860D7D7645AA767E7A2267874EB8
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0xDC17485C7A529F323FC1D029D3A1D53A
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0xD93C78B0337E9EA5798880D1FAA2D881
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x834F0F334E6DE852A7B72C7CBF17DCFD
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x111B29737DE311EA1851B539A456BF8C
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x7B68963654968D57049972FF6DC0777A
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x60EF88C1049C520028B7E6B9C8AB6A02
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x3ADD9429FD47BACFE8FB09C32248E135

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0xC501633B8D78C13039FCCA288FBCACDD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xEEAF739F2A5ADCD6B4AC46BEB1EACEF9
me.
0x567A9B2B16F92D6B6E4C92F75468A693

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you, sir."
0xF9E915B51BF5B18EF489C636DF07F73B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x5CD40FBFB8224599249C40F200B1122E
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0xEA1F5320FE182BCA9ED49626B76BAAFA
atmosphere?"
0x242DCD86C171E8F7022DA10BA8FA2E43

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do, very much."
0x01B932D03DF0D10D25FFE533284CE68C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x36032950A302AECF90E2772FCE6E48B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0xBC816FB0225BEBAD4F37644FC96A532E
with Mason?"
0xA1AAF0389DBDB236954501B43440EDFC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0x5863EDB1685C7141593062C65567B99B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x3C13E28DFB8500F2C7C03CEEA3D6C516
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0xCB4CF5E6F6DD44C4E58B65B36799F7EB
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0x4F24878B4BD563DDA4ABDAABFE253939

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

thoughts."
0xC2CBC9207F826A2E32CB3CFEDD5A43C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0xCAF6C9AFAD437B75F3F2E1D9E98236CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0x55576B9C7DEE926E4E7CA21C46A441F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xD3ECC792C4BBEBCCDCC32BE84134FBFB
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x14C3211AAF2B5EE53596C03B8C0F8474
spue fire any day."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0x33F60C4A3286496BAD036433B2B71399
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0x720B48841D4765024BE3C29ACACE6A69
you."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,

how to avert the danger."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x9D76A2187B9A0211D706396133508A63
from him.

him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xE94FA1112BA91F3A1D5BC50D35D7404A
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0xF19A06DAD46E8B3BA3E63E987ABCB1A2
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.

Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little

mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0x8C83B071384116C794D6DD2957F86EE5
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xF0FC9798C485DC087BA8D21CBC44F342
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xA8C52707D0620B21BC05CC57EE2183B0
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x18940B078DF45D29466C3286FF6B347B
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x4820D538FA60ADA22CD47D16B3BD0DEC
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xB42A631933212E7B0B56B92278CF7CBA
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x1F93DB080D6CCA6E91533848C93D5A4B
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0xC8BE17D400E7BE4DDE4445362BCB9DB2
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0xC7EB0AC0FED678C0072AF3F9177822B3
me at once."
0x8BFF5DDC04347452E98965D2FD70A5DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x69558DD43B6CEED1B24BB061C69F8BC1
you are very safe."
0xB96A9875E826608BFC667CBB02E0AE7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0xE0585C2145CEAB3A31C1A2A1C4D1C70B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0xB0BBE68FFA8C795839E8A6677CA57F0D
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x8044C130CFF99E495F5AF659B1F66CDD
before him.
0x136326543BD52CB17D1A7A9E25E55BEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0xDBEB74F2EDAB73EFC8599E23C3208F84
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0xB06CF498926169656FC579BFE465D6D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x1BC6B9BF868C033E183572156E9DA8D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x0AEDC7D0121E66A1A1B778425F2B80AF
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xFC9C06BA02775DF448348AA8B9313701
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x6F17CC393A3DF05D52A4FC12D1D27A0A
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x95CB8B847FE220B380E1C95E1817C250
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x447BA3AFB3484F002DF29C8C32F0049D
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x029AA6610A684D2BFA76F2E885DE88FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir; I am content."
0xADFA283715C32E69D79528776FBD080C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0x4A6C5CD102082560E1E526437B2EDD52
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0xB9F0FA4F86A99A1014E3B1718B1208FB
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0xAAF6C00DE691E89E85CA0B3710F8F178
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0xE8B80F22BE96A16ADCEEC7601593A6D6
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x4CCEBA6EEA790B23F2296800FE6149B0
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x0112C275D06B255D079A18D2A413514F
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0x2A0EBB14D7FEDC39E92649264D703A3E
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x9A828515D412E9B48FED0689FDA1DDBD
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0xE06A9532FD02E52FF7F369B654F59E82
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x7D3453B4923445213528850E520C020C
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x71065943D41D78BA04BEB7142AA55D68
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x10B9B990FFE849385BF032CABBC803A6
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x17C77EE2A72EB56819ED6954FAB8A642
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0xEC8B9B0E51D74F9CDD81259E66471E8F
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0xC39A7566A0F2FA9DA1F6ABA8A98FA7AA
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x7A03BFEF083E09F17DB7117684FA7E8B
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x890A0E93F57062F1678C949D3FC1C26A
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x8C784D0CB45658E9D0D87CE03F37563D
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x975FDDF5CFB6EE09C3AC159104351F66
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xBC72777724AFA3F69DD12424D3A42B78
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0xA9D970C1D6E2750E1985D4A0E1FEDF1C
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xE552C7B4046C05513295A2C18CAD1D37
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x6D73548A076D2C5A51B6CE6181EF8E3A
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x95EFCF7C3FD28A037DA9C2867EA2349B
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x718DEE20540FFFB8DD3FF94FA2B59E98
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0xB7D3DEAEDD1D27E2F1D8F40A727D9175
judgment approves?"
0x3940EC18702058D2307CFAF42D89175C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x57B19B9BC33EF9FA3E160818FE29420C
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0x539CCFF946A22DD870041CC2D882D3FF
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0xD4CD2AB09692B08AC6C0BED7D923397E
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0xB26AA8CCABAA494C1B357AFB422A0A02
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0xED1FA618FBE377C3956484A917E847F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xB3C51DD38CC6B98AA5E825CDD130C527

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x163F869CFD9AA59F1E1E6B2B15735C52
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x131FD69F60E91642091097C43C77CFBF
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x2DE018B41D5F8ED951FCA20634307CCE
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0x95B17BBF4546FF20536E4AF93A367F23

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x46C1F5D85DDF9B5C401D966234957BED
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x1D23A5BF6BE2E7E3915FD6CF1A177B0D
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x53F46ED158D2835938CEF83402B19563
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x5CA3401E421029FEB6D8BA08C316A583
amend and solace to heal."
0xC638704342F168BA43D37B69346B0484

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0xB535D6DE56A4F82DC7691B557BD1294D
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x22E53013495E8D3A67C67A2174D6A223
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the

0x3637F884E37D0AA6C1D2E770F5356EDB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xF2B8ACE9D01F8582A215608EF3C4BD03
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x3980B4BFB3A442609F83E3180EFEE78A
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0xA78C4E66CCBD75F819B012BA7C120152
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xA6D5338522F7330D507603E23A4C9CEB
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0xDF69537740FC11D92396313751A1DD4E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x3E7B202B72027AF5201F26BF09CB200D
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xAFE04D6FDABFA230DC9A4D1C227341B7
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x9B4C587585599B1D77DC2121A396B29A
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0x731E30F642135221B4945CA19037C5DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x996B2D5A8F973F8CA40D04DCEB87A807
came back he was humming a tune.
0x70FAA7A9A935ED069FD0F6085C589189

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0xA9AC3B5E7B73FE9966B068FED2A1D9A9
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0xFF68395179B6A2E46B7D27E2E4D1258E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Curse you?  No, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0xAA64C84AD4C67C89734CA12FBBF2A905
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0x91253DD1CBF47BA0CB317B5F670DAEAE
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x745CBBA00E54E005A2D8ABFE55B1A28E

able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x7F078F44C5371F47D51A634A7FD96233
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x346E12F926821544AD77AA00F7012A83
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and

cheerfully--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0xC44CB55483BB0391E34DC889145447B7
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x07BBF2A9B8C1E9FA9332DF77932E6D22
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0x2AA3EB84B76BCC89EA828971F31B08AA
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x459597DB2549F90CEA34BC171CF28A77
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0xA78325FD41A1870F78EC93AC59AE89F5
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0xB14338B916F760A8F97F3611C9F8C5BD
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x3798B55EF63BCB0C7128A98AC9509240
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x695ACC6E772C2F1C2FEE2AA654CC0781
man.
0xB10A4990553260E86554BD1B7338732E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xDAF27BF9BFDA12D69422F1C2D10C80AD
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0xF1F5AFE65557530510BDD6A50FF53FC1
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x1C7E104B7819E6EE39DB628E30E75D73
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x22FED6EF885D1493B0EF8B58B2D9F4F9
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xEF84687F696C2C53DFC693B32C398D8B
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x248C4D4B8C928437ABB092DD83871D20
little sister.
0xB31D226325A16440FDC3EB0AF2E5728A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xD5838D92D036044F32EDDB895CD1FE9A
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xFCD1F1C5E131FEADC889B24B03D0B1B2
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x0BE5D2D1A00D5F0CA6E0E00DB54158AD
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xA67FC6B2FF3190D227925050E3EF41E8
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0xFE36FEC448C3051F9F3C74B6C06048E5
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x8A981C85A0D039B5E88A78D10816068A
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0xB6181324624C646B2B0B594979A32C32
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x8C44FCD83F36D672B2BA75127831A5E3
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x4795720010B114EB84706B9DC2CF0522

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x2A91CB43BA2060A32531A7764687688C
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x889E906997B93CB035C39ADB1BFF9FDF
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x328E590E1022EBD8C67A31A17CBDAFE4
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x0269EDCF9D99D98C5FDD2F978FB1F266
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x8171BF1873A91547F1DAC364859F7E92
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xACA2FF2A15465931330E7DFFED3A901E
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xB7216C675DF7AE2497314164C596AB26
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x5F1B3A039CA075BC0365FD8F5ECD8DCC
was surrounded with a crape band.

"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xF2CF25099C6C24244B953C3B2D784009
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x245386A4D7658E7FB398DDC6A1A6210B
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."

"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x6012137CA5B899DA1FE554DD9C21AA5D
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0xE426244F389C67E8A7EF69C6036B83D5
are married to Bessie?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0x24971B54FD4B17E45F06D4D42FC294D7
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x0954849DE254247FF8E89817ABD105D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

badly at present--in great trouble."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x9E4F69EE5E4BC095AAA22FD9C3608473
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0xB6AB6C60668C600C6C0750348EDF2C34
his death was shocking."

"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0xD5CAA7E667597F256F27D2014BF982D5
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0xA4357FC16E6B1E1160CA5C717F67D7B1
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0xB10A0B8FA0F70E1C7EA8E37C77948589
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x578F8D62B9D37EA77C90B46762A989AC
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x52CA1062C1F4533F7ABB48856C54A865
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0xAB0A0705B48DA3ED0EB049E6DA491008
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0xB006232D13A69000F2E8143D9907BE69
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x098A7681246E5EF906AF6F883FDF03EA
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0xDEECD7448416DD375BE39C8D5E6A3908

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x1ADAC08A423A7DBA520C03C4C4F8913A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0xA2592183B11E062874C5DAABCC71BAB1
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x463BEDC3BCA879423653819815FA6805
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0xC9618D50E85A68C6CBBD6F649C8394A0
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x841C1E6A33A476DC81CD031545CAA763
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0xD8A225F91BA8ED19AEAB04CC6E7CCD2F
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x012BD50E8BEDDD4EF436A1A9D348165F
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x45E04F60EC97B2C44381B9E0A9BDD492
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0xC02D641D8618F769D91376B19E4A477C
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x8003A4F784AE92FBACDC0DFF7522EE42
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0xFD56BABC683217948611A232AB80C35F
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x10A9088C7C3AC41AB45C9B2678366A8A
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x0C020FCF048880E9C51B8CA3ECACF746
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x2086D87E86983271ACC1B1B54AC7B5D0
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x3A37EBE814CBB5B538AA22C0AC6182EC
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0xFD6FE17BDF8F1773AFCE73C9F14CDDAA
morning."
0x1E14C53CA4BC4B30D9560ED229D01AA8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0x83D99E52C64FDFC894D20E975836E3E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x9BFEBC8A0574ED00D7CE3CB302A04A32
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x2DF08570B021AC116A83E299FD451DC9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x52BC6C3CCAC8F81A6F9735040CB9896D
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x0077A1CA4BA8A51AB7135A8B3B607FF0
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xA96CE7D5B6C4B01FD0C7D1B435C4197E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x68A6C93C18C2615A86F4938F0CC176A0
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0xA2A9A351B09B31BCF835CC33C3D8864C
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0xC94F24E6AD04E7814135B6E6134DC188
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x4CDF791C018BA35D0E7C536F6790B705
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x854EEAB1CD97D51B9D50C7F0C028A5D9
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0xDD8BB84A60A28736418492CCD202AF16
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0x7AF0C81063106C13A8C80E77A17A15E5
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0x79F7D871449CC332B027F9D75B61F5DD
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x09B67C76C9B207771176AD4F999D5573
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x31F7CC64392DE957494F6192DE13D0A9
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x32DB43E4985E79086A4BA58BCAA4DFA6
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xBDDCA34D0958344709C72D546F2C370B
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xFD40F3D11C3D59A6AE21398B09FCE147
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xB7142322234BE4ADB10CB5279921D120
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xEEAD767A77B7F923A44E8661F8C37071
lineaments.
0xD46FF1D06FDD20F73CCC22170F35A5C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x8506B26D633EBCD7E8E3ACAF5B2B6AA3
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0xBD1FDB9C26C5BAAEDA332D8CED50BB91
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xB8B7624DED2F9C1051D00974114C172D
cue and followed me from the room.
0x92B8EFB353603A350396C890092C1650

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xEDD8C74220344C5673AD4C47958E6A47
which he had shut.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

people to see her that distance?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
0xB3BFB2D6A7CFCDE49B6C94AB6E03985A
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x454375CEB3D77DB8AE4B76EF483C453C
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x9E37085E0CB4D24E89C741E59C73EC55
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago

"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I

daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have

you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0xB532C74E6EB5B4C8E5ECA8451CC82D1C
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0x691477B455E9478A6F8C0075503392DE
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0xD6AF70F06AEC6135DD8DEE70E94254E8
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x4F9E8D2300A51E06FA46A8A8652DF402
if recollecting something, he said--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay

away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
0xED816BF622605E85E9023AE543DCD89E
plenty?"
0xEECDADDDE4A0778A237B91E4E69A263C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

while I have the opportunity."
0x6F0CAA710E29E7C49B595FE4824CC38F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be

married?"
0x11716A2CC61D32F4F7F53B79FA597F58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
0xBE1FEB96728D661CA098DD006EDB9DCB
perceive the necessity of it."
0x733971F4BB703E108F22D52A09CC5E62

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x619B28ECED43E04FC23F823585CD4818
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0x97465867F4E0CE3ED193424911A79704
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
0xA9C37512BD6F631A892126B6BF5EE45B
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
0xE833CF87BC7FAC319DCFA38022D22985

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

you to seek a place, I suppose?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
0xC4A43CF7E894132B5823FCFB17FF183E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril

you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
0x39B793819A93C9AD45358E9F2782D726

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
0x05CAC7D91633887A2E4B966AE8618BC5
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."

something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for

"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked

myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0x353B195318F297EB3B1A7CF44E1BE26B
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x431B1A52AB50BD13A87E8F6E68CB3F00
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0xD26D61446CE281C4C5F52596E4FE2749

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0x0243133D680BC5020CDBBC5B8CF71C9B
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0xFC04C5C4DB10D2FFCFD91EF880A260EF
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x54C3CF9BAF91A4E8F7A13BEEF73D3B12
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xE0BCF0C3E1AB673973573223B862F207
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0x8AB9C44358CB14B20BD5AE97FCEA5CE9
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0xFBFC6C2450B24207922CBE2A2CD7B3EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0x6F384611F991C277BE927B7364423088

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0x8C4460163E70E93452E897ACE39044BB
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x199FE5960B8A2D7C0F1E0FEAD6F81294

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0xC52EC6BBD043692653693A8C9B95E74D
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x4D88F86C820ED585F7038FEA21268126
will finally recover."
0xDEF5FA27123FD4B4A3AE571186BA1DBF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x4E1A3B2E6AE4DFE8876F8EB26DC501AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x6D4490F08FB09E170E20924ADC3FB6D1
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x58C183E13A2175FF5F0E8D091A768221
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0x36CF734CF4C54F5775B2DE2EEF177623
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0x0997A1E724CAD6EFC6377C74E2F8AA2D
and then I will go up with you?"
0x4454191BE9439846CE68B1BF8443530C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0xFA5597284B4DA18FA9C298732C1ACD00
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x44E71A78C5F31DDF62F099DD8472F0D6
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0xAAC01DA62A2AE6D77833157A74CBB043
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x2878FD8AD0E850DBBCE5FB20546841E7
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x83FAA1A27E4568F1AC8CF41624F40104

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0xFA2B1A31A1A42A6457E0C7D34A045E63
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x8F228EB74A92A0E778899549046458FD
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x558112BC2372E506986FC5A67B870C7E
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x62D103639A973B6DFB64B625324444D3
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xA7E257C1089F95FB7B6AFA077A102233
looks.
0x2CA1EED21B3FEE56DC4D4657E1304744

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0xE9FB3B3AA64FEE6B82AAADA5677BE487
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x0D1E5189BB5F86DE32EECCC277EB019C
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0xD085A92AB3B1FCC6A0A65DDF37D0868B
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xC43A343012DE01BB533BAF9C23570177
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x2B05AFD18C260AE3B9D332F8BBBA8A92
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x4A86DDE77652EB50B5624E80EAEC49C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x55654853E3E20BD54B6F57D3EAF5CC36
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x50D3C06EF2B55A8ED0308C9508ECF22D
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x036E0029D21530932EFEC1A3AB6B330A
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0xC96F627268884B040341A97342DF8C8F
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x4C8E8DB4D089FA30600A172750B4F8CD
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x3B73A58F5DAC1CA05DBDC3FCD3476C12
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x541CC0348A79FB58222B809CF9819E3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0xAAA06A72AEBF2FF95CA6E6DC7ED240BC
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x4EB12C7F220318318C6813699FCA11EA
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x3140ACDA2E21680CD355B82249E38025
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0xE160AE9B28A2FBB2CBC1DDBC2C75342C
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x2DC6AEA378B810447E196CA5B9A29A9B
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x9CEA937FA34CCFAF096A42E9EF1F9F68
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0xBFBA18B7A1420C2DC8855C4B7EE1AE54
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x977D5E3D760AC95A26F18C69DBCEB4FE
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xA5B9E6D149EB8B4E887332CF6ED3E07B
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x3B6803EE7C1A273B99D78A41A7B37E0F
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xED7F034E46F5B511FD540DD8C534C41C
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x00ECAFE6D79533E0C25488AEC7E76B36
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x099EFA854B458B4AC1931B78D757B569

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x00DEE7164381A06990AE71D30F475D80
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xB0F82D1F25C410B90CDEEC4851443BF7
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x5530A76AF8BE468DE9128BCBF07CB342
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x945CE94C1BE33B3D07E0B79B599C4917
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x1E180C017A4A7C9146C199FF2665CE63
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x3787C1A2E81F0DAB9C3252E006219E10
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x085D8DFF72D56B911F87B119C6BAAF32
past recognition.
0xA1D3A23B77D82EDB6CD5C57BCCB5951C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xC98CA7C2EA25B827C1E3695D5279327E
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x04A20230517740AE15FD3BDAFC4AB1EA
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0x4E5E292552CAD27FA84620A2B99964A5
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x9742C146F196344E131FA8AF8D3AB319
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xB411D08C5E27AF491CAF13FD0694EA59
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0x6B0FA4794C05E6A471CFD90ED5B2EBA8
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x0115007D2E51B2E9CE191041B38C8AAD
colourless visage.
0x0F03EF0D5FF3169F4FE0B287D113B428

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0xF06F6D1F1628E8B4A387C8C98D99AB63
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x7B281EE3636D4E1097BDA82358D07E76
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x89FAA3B6E898CCD975BC42213A9A4C2D
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x2BEE4565865C87730667A950C7807B02
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x244715CB98DBF21E6CE3465E3BFC679B
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x94C99BB5789BC2B435D5F7B537628AD7
other's looked puritanical.
0xE9583B40D22DC3C96FA504CB1313483F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xE03A605D31C3E83F33A8A99CE839DA6A
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0x1318456132C4E4C7219413EAD1BB04DD
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x0189793EBA2962BBE55D7B800B034F2E
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x22B73245B985C5846517C41EAA29CACB
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x5047EF3880F0A6896277F2C24D4FBA8F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x9A7CEE5FBBBD5978561A45B0796F05CA
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x590E8B2C322EDAD7E16A7AA6E6A01746
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x596FFD8DBFE06B5869D87169D64767AF
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xF5E0DA04884339B86BCA7087391A457D
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x9ACDC811ADA78B9B2F418CEE95E5C1A5
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0xB415E3C302DF57965163628D31A00611
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0x2C1CDA2B9D2924D2EEC3EB25FACD25B5
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x5D4806C3113ECC5DADC138690D496BE2
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0x078EB06526CE0CDFC6400867793CC0AF
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x8CBCEC9FAC0F8CB1F9CF381F41A3892E
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xED5F2096CE712D3698817DA91896CA47
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0x0E90F3067DD737FB2276506CE3BB981F
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xF7D9699603E4FEB2DC7BDFC19EA07DFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x4CFB409DA46053D6576EF9F4BD5B17AD
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x4F783C8D9B57F1C52224D1EDA241A88A
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x83A375A1C134CD58619AD3D44853A645
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x8C0AA3C4FA5037DCCA1E51FE7F12F2C5
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x3224FFFC564D70BB856860833EDB7A62
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0xA23818E3E16702A16217AC903E4D6C75
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x55A6AE6419CAC0731E09A7A376990CFD
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0xE25BE3F9947632A5DA793C83CA518CA2
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0xC42E21886DF221BE52D4C0D339533682

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x47C8EA023F7611E06890AC5309D37A66
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x2331B204165B05DE968E19B3536C0A4B
liberty.
0x42DFD8BF96B3F79F2DD20F135CBA5FA5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0xB26E73943186107A0BAC7A62CF5D7471
can see her to-night."
0x8E16F7755C9059F17D7E2E5EF0FA68E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x41D145C7DA64F6330BFD34F847A4A1FD
should be much obliged to you."
0xC8B3292A10CBE7B195BB348DC6AD8293

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x4720873C748735049EA1F8A49546C813
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x8FA92805A92CCF8A3C8715B517B6D0D6
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0xA01D757A1D11C9EB88FFFC608F5F2656

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xEDE7D2B3F50EC377B22C5AF73070CD4B
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0xC78D63742EEB18BB6D56542C940D25CC
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xA5F556DD390CF7589B7FB1F75E995E6D
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x0578FAA4636631981B66EC659723C034
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xAA2933F7B1D832FC97B36F5B1240D50D
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0xDFAC27AC0BAAA984B4A618A8EC08DA15
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x6E9FF7C49E047B5A8C0900C13D0603E8
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x187ABF5EA4626B6A22F9416F57401DE5
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0xFED48B7D4417DB50C6E7B70205C5AD65
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x551B01195FECD52378F752AC970F74F0
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0xBB85DC42BB21FD3996D03160E0A46A2F
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x1C02316BDD7CD05E14868DBCF2AFDBE3
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x6ADA373195214DC838A115C558F5866C
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x31AC57E73361606E6F85DEE059A36CD6
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x8C58DCB0AB29FFC9BC75951B54CF1B26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x1851A09C28B1E272ACB24A4255451279
us see if she will know you."
0x9F6E6704B9766896ABFDF0FA56056F76

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xDFF2AAB867A3EC9A905C21661E741A9F
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x214DD9DC18862090CEC441F5AB9BE41C
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x802A473BD2A2DBC3A81D603D869CE679
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0xD62244C335F33B3B0A0D183DCBBDFFD2
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x7D959924CCC5ECC1724DFB5A903212B4
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0xAF387285AAA64086C931CB2498A7F696
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x7AF90E499985262553929F51CF2A3BA6
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0xCB6C1F4E39FD3324ABB10F2E6AACDA3A
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0xFA81421A91A630F333E419BE8EA64C9D
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0x0F34C93157ACE65DD80A561B176A3506
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xEC3D6CB1CDAEC217B311A68704B7B1F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x4BAE0152A066B4ADACE0E3D8470BAB42
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x29194720E78D43972031F44D16D5BC04
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xFC68DC03B4B977686898FF126F50664A
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x5B92B503779833EEFFCD9A3BE6490E16
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x8CEE7E23646AF578BD99EC1A633E2952
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x4EC40214F3A21F99D4C480B346E41430
amity.
0x1E8341A9629DB407B048184852B1F466

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x65086023F26944B2E85C5B5C0A5FA3CC
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0xA843F246F97EEDAC0B7230DE79DC8ABF
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x6C92878E3A5DC8B98ABEDD61C94B0E30
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x2ED922F7DCB8119916044BA6FCB5994F
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x0F468F88D30D1A3AE6F7EA239141D49C
she looked at me.
0x8F7EE9CD474EDD636F2707EB7CD092FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0xAA48B4DE5BC625D120F428B26D6FA283

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xA3B415F417300C9C3B3152489B85D249

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0xFE458F86183D7B92396EA638FD0E15EC
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0x5F6B157067A35BC695BF8CCBACE88913
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x0ABACE3E4534D6259068D98E25F4D7D5
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x6B4A36D2ED95CD4B7C511D0AE5B214AF
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0xE146BCB632FAA71DA933759F7BA1870D
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x6AD60AC8FAFABAD7204C792F876FCCE9
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x717BF3611FDA6E8711AB851BCC1471CA
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x6597D0E9277FC84A89A7765B325F1539
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x24F2A18205767700CD8FE2BE740B514E
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xF0FA699A94787C5A4BE15B293C8EC96B
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0xDF2729DBFB2AF40DE625F71521C1CA78
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x3779FA028CDDBFAB9C86FB6DC4DA5ED9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0x38B1FF7A60341581FBAE38DAFE584C71
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x3275EE7EEBDF31008BA05D1C61A79B63
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x68C686604ACEE582A0CB38A97CDF495E
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x7A1BDD991BFF54BB74EBB584E43299DE
the pillow.
0x5926963485F573C92DF78FAE061B6776

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0x2AF2B709647535A01E0B35811BC647A2
till I see how you get on."
0x088A62754785D6BE02390E83ED486B49

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x5FEA0BC1CDF20C59809FB17C7C8D01F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xC6BC1F26F98DAD9AFDAEEDC47958822D
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x2314BCD179BBCE6F62F30806B30356AD
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x0ABE3CE57FC86F5034688B4ACC9B8A1D
say--let me see--"
0xF101A420F9B0C4DBEFAE6A18F7938112

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x3265B361C7D3D523547878EB9186300C
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x467D313204899F5CBAF4FDB5E60C44DF
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0xE50EF23AA092AAFE2E329034909EDFB0
was at once irritated.
0x6EC96AF51A7BB12945DE77E3AFB53AB7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x5296A50BE424ECDC22F7B3F536345434
you Jane Eyre?"
0x05A84EA4C33CA6B229C0A60A1708F43F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x039EB79F5D62977560B2312889C8CA74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x025D5496BA791523E402BD53F3DA7558
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x007E31BF4F1307B387D7302EC656E3C9
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0x865692985B4953974287C36BA03BF3DE
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xF4DEED4A5EA07FBACB7DBE859C071DD5
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x2F255D340BC76E251984A30EAD76DEE8
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x7B315E2C8E0ACFBC04C7D0EDC9238559
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x870835D952660B4338F4940ADEB1EF50
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0xEE45CEA1D7295ECFA66131420CE218D8
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x3F9DB7EB4A1DB3DEDB264EBD2E394979

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x8EABD0926C97BA19F1006E40CE3400CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x934F3B0FB9FBBB038B7D3CE0B61473EF
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x93323F4CCE927A930B87BA2246D4E0E4
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x25CC5C9176253EEFC298AE71FB08BEFD
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0xF64ACA68F19B66B3808FE52EBE63CEA5
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x632D5138AE7C70FD1DB06D43CDEFB3AB
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0xD538A6B5B58B44CAEAAAE50DA94B16B2
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0xD36D27643C40E912A287F2914F67512C
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x6B7DA422A77B4241EAE52F5E5314F253
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x824274028D47D50D76ACD9E4F8513B7F
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0xC1567F7EEE14055E9D95AEDD21556DDA
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x73FBAA2D3D20CF9CADE2965E73CCAF2E
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x5950AE22AD74881F4ACE5DD921992B1E
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x2F5071B813AB4E3C5353866C8963B89E
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x1497973BA5A1DF55258DF9039F47557C
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x4AD214262E129C14DB8041DB358D0DCE
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xC798D381CBC45C5CD7D153AC868B0A9C
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xA25FB5C7EDB1AB88F32B0D78FDF7DE0B
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0x8E8D2EF42817596AE6D0301F434BE8A4
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xF9DDAC2537A17D64B5D690F4FD553BE0
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x7C88F94E268CC6AE0E3BCB0066FB848E
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x3A5F5459F228922DF761A86003C51A05
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0xECE3BB85EC812E548151E6D8A87190D4
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xF52810D28B535F9F313EFF128BD76ADE
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x885B12C13AA8018479A628A15AFBCE5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0xBA61C0B72564080BB78376784A6C24DC
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0xC2E65988B2AABF6ED14BDCF7FBD96D75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x7567CE68DDA97589778B37516424E302
the morning she is calmer."
0x8781A6A4E2E97E87CCF5F29F150DFC36

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xECEC16341A8ACAEB4B770CA89CDCA726
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x9BCDC81F16B7443F3EFAAFCD3C1BCFA0
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0xDBA59003094B05F618F17F70F3F41FDD
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x18F67425A3B52F063DA191E760DB16E4
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x9FC38F241F320F112A068717672AF7CC
had?"
0xDDCE7B804BA07741E393F1A50FF722F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0xB76236D1B26B910CA458A9BA7C91C2AE
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x151E43FF5D44112AD13CDC9B14BB88B1
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xBBAB673A0410020820C5F718E3C7A639

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x9AFB0AA7AE5AA6B89B2A25CF45B0260A
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xF2F74CE4F823E091A59C21564A63B68E
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x03BD7AC60F6D2ADE38402F5F56766A00
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0xB79A25040CB4E5C4F629327BD5057BA2
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0x8900DE08BB8EA68026297AE27A0FC0AC
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0x76AA649F941DEBBA5672409FFE83CE2E
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0xA68E3C0D3358C25299CF443927BBDE8C
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x42DB1D129CE452CA02E19FF96390FD16
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xA775BEEE7665F0D7EE9DC690CDB82973
for both.
0x259F1D6948AC1419489A126328546C3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xD75F129E1706BB55BCBB4319AE38DBD1
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x1526DAC4EB9A7AE990FA746D62F7B6B1
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0xE4BE31ADB1FEDF78E9480FB5C59FEA05
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x9AE1B94E88634E4AAAA14D0826AA12A5
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x992EAD7E267DAA7F19DE24D3D83ECF4B
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x3C89BC915FE5D672B75025FCC34BA7B1
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x9053261BF30F04109408430943D04F73
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x9182190F4F728CD82E7CC6B873A7C6CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x32592C832BB6F390033DAADB54D4D34D
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x4BBCC9EE2FCF724BD754B661A05D665A
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0xD53AA976EF35913A8EAB880365E63250
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x39A15DC583A6FD6556C52C8C47759CD4
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0xBD6DC731C23E4B97CC25C6C2D07FD19E
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0xA570341A645204A14EFB33ED95ECFDD1
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x861FF5E224458BDC2AD27831AA30C5FB
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0xC0624AC22762F15EF79868515DFEA2D9
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x0CCED5F200FE6BC8D460843F5997E3E2
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x70EA5E3118D7614956024320668F7931
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x648783A2D2E5D86C731C19D3932005E6
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xADB59662353E0CCDBA3020C7D6D813D9
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0x4ACF4865FE12077A52E906132658056C
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0xD221002F795C20FC9C86E0182AD471DA
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x8A618659FF1E702857E3F3DEBA403CF8
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xB48D156C82410C3B956A04F355FCE5DB
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x31F76870380C04A567256AA297437192
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x37EEE6B07643536518FF27B5DDC71054
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x1344D366906234C89955DE94E085691E
and content.
0x53CC1C54F11E71F4F2FDB9E8C0951D51

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0xDF243657C8B0B8763755324E25B4E1A8
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x0F0B94CF615F2DE6F986FDBD67F0471D
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0xB72A74B41A6777D61778E71727BBA5A5
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x2543E8F63F563EBA7D7A0E3DBFCFCA28
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x89407FDC6C1BAF336C3F09A7FCED1ABF
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x25EC43AD7041699E3BBCAE05A99CF2EB
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x19DD636E0CC210C0B9A65AA1567CFF4E
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0x2C27C7F3FFB85E57C722D8C2B2691388
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0xF1237E7C19F5A0C5D5413FA5B0D5A519
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x3764AFCAA18CFCE2ED47D1145D633EC4
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0xA9F99A68ACDA32E30036D358A8AC94EE
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xC19F8FEB1CC50AB5E31796A652332251
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xA3CA586477D0F5B3F6B129A94F95F67F
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x73DCFD7D81D035EA61F04506B285985F
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0xBDCB7F28B00986964AA8612D11BFC76D
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x2AB61C2A761F2FC02591127758867429
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x1F80184C67329E7D14CC1705B9F3FE52
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0x9FF937305175A0099006154881FE0F13
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x80297BB14A0DB585372EBCFC3D33C632
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x0FC89405BEACA9E1DC98ACC9C49E9643
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x0128080DA4D69B2BA3A8698636C4B98F
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x15A07FAA44F15512F274AC023EDC075D
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xA43551FE88AF495F2674148D0CECBF37
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x30AE213CBB292D6F092337C095ACE6C2
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x8817B84786D8440DAE2CC9D21FAC8B4B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x6269BB4BF61CFF5F4EF9D97189105DE5
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0xD54F644B35A95B54686C3D32E01BC717
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xC3162FB7CE58AD91301F85A9844B45B0
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x8AC4992423EB4902B211AB29D2BD885C
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xF4821DD02FBB1ECA1098D60793D52407
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x31B6CF0AB216B77031A744D7D688824B
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x620CD677E829E15BCBFB1EBE06EE81B4
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x99F9BE046171A463F8A144CB3566B10C
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x0A2C2FDC54B76ED6FD2C8CF2D91CEAA2
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x55A43EAEFA2971B8C0AD39C5826A042D
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x57E2DEFE643ABE58C2FE6872E5F41962
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x805F2ADC4BB21A87F0D48B709D3A6A2D
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x28D5ED78B17F0FE6C61D54EFF4362E99
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x3C853FEEA4D12FD5CDA0F4B5C0044F51
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x81D8E7AAAB663EBE6288701299828434
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x8F44600CD2E66BFCC2A630813C747F69
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x62DE0C3E03828D4D9C9C273B502C5A6F
vary its clockwork regularity.
0xCA8B04BE8156EDCCD550714CB727DAEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0xF66321C71EFA866C29A45A0251D49E04
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x26A2C8C7E7A5680B5195FFD6122E006B
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x97F267DE10B746B925864CF6DAA180ED
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x7017F642E49F01F27B7644753CEB7067
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x769589693C15707757BE2F5D157FA3BD
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0xDE6501C72C9604404C9529CC808DAA1A
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x12F883EBBB9D3679E10B8B4FD7F975E0
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0xF18CDF4A317A03EAB81780CBA1E90F14
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x4F42EF230530D219F3F7E1E7FC16A9E7
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0xFF5466B70454DEF69F558A930CFE6F94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0xB4DBF1B15837723C6346DF4AD81E4E70
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xE8C9CF850232151F56CD589788628F31
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x5AEC75FFFDF55FE75A86992A5BCC8A57

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0xF489CB7C6D34994489D9AAFC00AB617D
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0x632C2FACDB1C15B400A60996FA349F9A
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0xEC112BF5327EE07E4007AFB2B0E33422
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x1B900B05520967536C81391682538498
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x44F4DB63E2374DB3CB06C1A4BCE3DACE
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xEC5B620982BF9AA9C010A1DCA5D1C3B6
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x110A8FC2B4784967A04906CFC94BF56E
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0xD729DF364DD14097985F34DAEEEF0CD2
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x63763FEF84E778CF3CFC7DAF5EE69587
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0xECA66888DED493EDDD71A8B27174E5D9
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0xC39441CED863059E165A477452FA86EE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x9A3E87EA392012B7B3F53C86B76F00F5
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x2BEFF86EF6D1BE7A05E0B7FFE65EA52A
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0xFD1F2FFC8C96257909576A1B5BF7708A
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0xBEC800CC19A12E8030CD5F8C3A145927
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x5554242B948C6900BFBB99CDB436A7D7
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x71B77AE7D34DD8F2AB52981A4EBBC8E7
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x8C0CAE178AB0512B003A4D0DF25203C7
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x236174C054CD453CFCC907CE5F810DCD
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xD3D27FBBC997AF2AD2C0EB940984B55C
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x454C22249C2D891FF8848207FAC105C4
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xA66E09D23C109DBF3390061416433AB3
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x0242799CB4294E50033BEDAB78760552
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x9414F9F810C78019E98ABBEFDA660113
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x49C75DAD974F08B9F855AC7BCE0E3A33
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0xA0B67753A63ECB3E6E98FEDA74381B36
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x48D4BE8B8607AC409D3F9CC58D4D4E24
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0xB6DF35605C3C7E2BE5A2D7236FDDDA82
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x5FF4B921101878D60D775310B0F47F9E
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0xC1C1755F73921184C80D20DDFA51847F
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x670482FB6C85FF2A8963FA2E6B106CCD
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0x4946D5334C107E5BB63E0073E5879D85
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x9A8669EC6936D6EB01F532113A7C3954
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x1E7598FFF21C5184DB7F8DDDA7965403
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x1A37E78884E5B16EA778218DD6DB20D1
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x0C0A0572E8C2C57DAE7DD3E4A5DEA1AE
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xD816BEAB502661929D1AB03F779B3BA2
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0xA23044633503B58B88BDD0F1811B534C
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0xBC170A7FF310C36BD6B252A887B3E6B1
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xA3F43F867D7D9D03DC83DC714B9914E7
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x931387B2E5077DB12E40B30CB332BA5F
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x59443435F8BB01E6E2CF5533AFBA43F6
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0xC9E61D050A67F0130C29DC7054D16AAC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She closed her lips.
0x48B1457C25576C7A33B732A2AF92EBE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x363E46BBA5DDC9CF602BA57E5D60BFFC
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xADA1F13192A032F300C22FCABF42F9FC
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0xF0C12D7C17AC87F50FF6922F2A2B7E4E
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xD6A1A042671A0BBFF6518440CB0FC92F
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x0F23C89CFCDD102A5156D9F54D2EB1B8
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0xF0FAE45E712D7464500EAE77DD3B5C0E
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x59E018603CED2618E6BF17914394D664
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x97297C49E309D861434A69F80F82AC30
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xDF8A7B485DBB6D02ED9C966864556106

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xADB612DF57D5FDB5428A2AF0F873A968
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0xE1F4B42129C9AC7AA6E35A58D826AD7A
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xE50069C9C93AAEF7BD3A3B70DA644493
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0xC862B6B8A07B28F7D647CD239AE896F9
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0xD425C5B289EE007C3074F3CDB632E9DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x1F229C2AF113AAAE8F8749EF42B8F44B
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x63EC39B205901473FD781DCDE616DA96
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x8ADDD138656D88F328B5AA0D0F2E0203
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x9E7A1F135DD2A3FBE4E40927462BE439
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0xFAD28560660019F4F15197F65B489925
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x1B8C15564B3D3156F9E75FC66613EEB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0xE015F84BF98644FAA2AA604CFE335740
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xCDA6717E68C116C7943B03D1C8548CF6
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x5725E9DB83AE8AC65A158FC25944745F
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x857E55054E94B395273A2DE431867A64
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x4333B96A39FEDB76E7E745517795E378
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0xFE199DB2506FE7D88873E3B5366FACCF
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0xD8D107678F6C0A1346C815B0B3AD9930
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0xA66FA0C662F17B7D7EA6CABA8661EFF2
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x218733ACEC733D10763E1540888EFB28
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0xF09939D1340153B891DF6891DD230419

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0x0EBCA5634C824F518834421DA9EED7D6
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0xC92E5FAAB8F10794F06AEE2100DF0364
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x736FBEE47F1BDF2F640046112CC46255
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x8E4AF018C5E0B5CF3B49A85495152B5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0xF92318666514C1844F734DB37382019A
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0xC8947C9AABD2CC48CE4F472856179AD1
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0xEA65BBA149B3B22718BB6CE787FCEA61
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0xFB468D31F45AAC8259ACE9FADB1805C3
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0xF89167939CFF54D3B1630F6774484710
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x2CCE91743EDADC9DB3D2B564284AA113
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x1677FA666C4A0D88AE156D0ADEE221B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0xC14A8FC0A06E0E8CAD94AFA42E94AE86
her.
0xA76893936BFD55196A8247A9DD26F124

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x7E8A02A2ED54531101425ED4344A3771

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x20ED2E3AD1A14910F24A6ABC45DFAA5C
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0xA57D5C67CD5D5DCFF54EA1E9A49B1B96
me--where is Bessie?"
0x3208E084354C7F926149251A507D139E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x25F871BFE3AE35869E62FC894C78B7B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xEDBC30CE6EB3BC3D9063630205E45D66
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0xE469AB8993CBC3C5D8ABCB0E385D17D5
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x7611AFB84F807D5ABCC253331CAA1CB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0x4DD96E2226C19A87A8AC59732E0B51B3
identity.
0x7961EA71E461FFEB6A951AAC4762CA2D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x7542DB79ED6FAA9FEE026BCD9656305E
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x3ABA214F24BE170095811F1048128D9D
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x1AC9C6551BD059613170C3A699DB9812
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x87D05DA4404FF7E08FF825F288E7D703
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x6D755A5285016301F7FBE868BB5825CA
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xB5FB65391130CB78CC594AE56A565C23

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0xBC41E709236A00EB1937ADEB8B056571
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0x83084527FB49726D52F760BECEFC6F5D
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0xAE48459FA031EB40FB9681111D55750F
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x58804A90CE4F340DE529AFD7219F4DD2
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x1DADD4396AD8AA1AB95C60B1EA841B42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I assured her we were alone.
0xD1FD2E5382410FAE410962601C7F08EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0x13A716E81CDE0E6DB3EDCC8C62287688
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0xD386FB5E4DA38CF0A96668292BBC94A6
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x43C031B1227544D2A5F6A73B25ED5C6A
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0xE85CBC5118C640367733B3950D4D6AF4
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x2776AD6680EF6689931183978EB24C73

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0xF15706A0615BC84085850DF2FB86BE25
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x8AC5AC9C3B3A2B8C3DA4C738D75C20FD
of the last pang.
0x45E735401766EA215EC21D8E2988E98C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0xCF9AB5EAA3D6218158613C83129C6EE7
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0xDCC226580A27921AA4C6FC9B9DFB66BB
there."
0xAF3664244C001064D9EAA5AD57469106

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x4EBD759E0623E4D34B914BEAE770A120

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0x87EFAB570CE4BCE4F0FF508F85CEB71B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0x363F15DC9E7DBCE3CD59B946D7D309F8
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0xBEED5953C3131679CCE6D0C52F3FA43E
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xC0F4E59D8EBF1F9E1BEFD48E9FBB44A6
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x026AEA404A86D46F31B3681D63DD8D7B
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x3D1E6B328AB3A1710010A89FA678B5DA
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x57DAE0C5714EA093BB757735EE0FD1DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x2CA68BCBE6940F32B881007E74A594CC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was dated three years back.
0x0873BB517578E086DBA6E09E4842BB6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x06FC6EF33188E3C5AB3C5DE0FDBB20A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x335CAC235D9CBCC60E0C1EE047FF8173
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0xEA61C691363FAD2E1378E6AD55BA8439
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x9F9614D8AE30827178FE75BB2E6D4846
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x45AF981C502EABF56E042AFAE84E24D2
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x999F89A3992049DBC12FA8C71FBAD88C
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0xF4CFABACEAE7B6974A57B6B8157C7625
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0xC1788EE4FF9F2CD60F44725D2DF6EAE0
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x4B6ADFD52386071438C78F73091973FF
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xEE41098BE43DC8C7D36EBC60B57EBF13
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0xB188538CBCA4D6595DF9D3BF7CBB8912

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xC0FEC6551AE2CCF80D66D5478F478C4E
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x1D98E1472FF962FA203965377F65BCD7
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x17A04E8F3969C97E278B0C09DB743AA2
passed since that day."
0x647FE4AC2D7B0EFE18AAE3CB3980823C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xEC6150ADF24E556FADA10D3174A1439D
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x8271367E9CC226726EFCDD33DDEADC3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0xFE3AB4ADA932CF66BB208E61E0FE2BCA
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x3C63A95F920A7FCC572FF3E14B8C2928
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0xD7A7060664C2253224617DFAE2568EDA
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x6B2FD6AADB65574353B0F476814B5E29
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose

my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x8E8EDE59DA86FDF3450BE0F3C7133170

for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0x93EF12A1C1EE42DFAC6668839DE2BD47
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x9635DD85BAC8BB0C75FA9FBDE61948B8
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x849D206A5713E7A99ADE890EDCAB9D2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x98C38A6AC086D21E8D594373041B2CC5
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x937101039ABC1810F42C5D946673D04B
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x4E396092AD70574C8AA1161868333769
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0xC6DB30AB1DCBB6AC1C1FC667E380D8C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x615794F3B94C326D1C5D2940A57C2CC5
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x93029060CB36DB570EDADA5CECAB63C5
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x31359017EBA6598B124CF715487563F2
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0xA4B1BAF26DB19A75A417639D585A993E
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x4ED2AC89B050062DF47C9FF3DACE1283

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x4354198BE118F70686B5336613E13D7C
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x426B088939F52AB0912837A05A499C21

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0xC0BED56054BAF018A92B757B657582A2
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0xB24AB0DFCA0CC02EB84F8806DE2F47A1
she must hate me still.
0x30187C266A2E41D5E8A8F21229EF0140

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x8BEF9B3BDA4DF8969A1729B0967E599E
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0x2BE557751B60EA704A40615B9B3A9C47
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xD7DA89ADA1D6DBD9976967E88F0A40BC
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x483D41619974A3955019ECC54BEEB35A
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x9387712C22A466BF041EE938BFD3678B
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xE4ED976DB17F1B1864171B6F51A53E2D
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x8FDF79F4D2BD7046D214F6EF1766FEE6
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xAC0FED3E88CEE7E6B629897570ED565E
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xF3F18EE62541EB0A0B53BC24A6759DE9
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0xF5527DE48C943DDAE92539924048C02D
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xD8455501F404E9FB303BF32C2FEBA3D1
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x2D6E9773786D3C4D1EA3774A2E413056
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0xB34A156E2427556CD84AB329DB6DFFC2
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0xB3FD1BA515F0C7D11CD7B890DF388083
form.
0xF5FBE7474E2C019D53B52E655FD40BC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0xDB3447361EEC22EF2F410F6628006708
observed--
0xD7F85D7753DF1F7D2C4F9BC3E43743A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x6BDC2BE11F335913DB6B7E0EF5907442
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x3194C3E7228DB0F0359480406F133EF6
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0xFFD26F2BA0B91C0708A0FC86F8AA5675
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0x9F0C1F66A0D1FC23DC58E4D7A2481E13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x9302EE8658B0FAA5B9D25EB97145F74F
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x4605FC7A4DA11DE097A59B9FD9A1AE83
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x7A55E04A54BA4892F5314010AFD799C8
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x4F708E6575998CF5B4AE4CEDECE234C5
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x800DED7C12471B23215A639BBB882CBB
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x0960E9C532B87F491ED745866B8943EE
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x3299110077A800B5BFAB991389CF05AA
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x399DECCD65FA8B05754A0EEB61419906
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x18F93C9D5123805C9B983BB12FAF672E
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0xEBC38CA086D8C42428AD8F48086AF875
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x17BE88781F62A1F17D036CE303F8CDB9
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0xD0E87121555A25A882E91D82F8CB4905
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xB383D0E2EF78DD1DD0FB1E95454B6255
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x556C0E031AF4A310B28B7EFC1D961363
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0xE29D9E588F9C7691323EC462A9C74093
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x3647A7EB30C3EA055D3789DAE1720422
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xC78D6D4CD28ACA95E643BAE5C5C7CFC1
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0xA08C501E855B15042261CA964613C521
patient and compliant on my part."
0x3C32F206543B4AD784E3396D91E9CD9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x8EFB4AAD64D08419E9E004B814E77DE7
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x93FEF82F042AB7C4CC8FFBC7AC134002
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x49A0C2DAF9F0CD880500BE63BB7E4A5B
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x398B9CDE19CDE74321D7929A42B573F5
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x5AB1106AEE6FB9218F71FCCCD7800E0C
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x6E58A3979675C2148414BBE4DACDFF68
notes of condolence.
0x0FCA0CA4E83BD454DC1C9E7744D9F49F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xDE954969724373E8D1C5D32E44D73C93
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x29A8012F4EF65F362CA09B582A9AF496
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xABC22822657584E0F2825AF7D171795A
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x67E769B0D95F95C9940D26016999FC4A
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x6B7AF93587D2E14EFDA08EF9316881A0
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x9414429660D428667230948710ED35E0
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x9EDA6312D1263851702C8EAFAA40F712
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x80EEF2DA7FA7245FEE67CD5B8F1DF6C5
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0xC96E91EB775694F27505C3207C4F1AE7
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xB7D1A7E54FF9EE90F7A7914E32B8F358
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x6EEDEEDDE1A05CC72E8D82BFE39AEA81
veil."
0xFF37501C5E11053CA2578BB04380FD35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0xBEFE6C7D9D8809C1610B3231C87A2F3D
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x476E1D9B011C0CB369C192A90C2CDB33
good may it do you!"
0xD48AAEF08FE2F53BF2B6191022EAAE06

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x26B9EF4344B174858C299DBDFC8038A8
you have some sense."
0xFA4CDBFCEF28C0C3D4E8B508CC31389B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x3F73689F2F8001565D0F0CC0B035BD50
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x01C974E556FC684D637A3826B813EB60
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0x1FE5FE9EF60053335875EA94670C5F17
much care."
0x010637F449190277FE44A9DC75ED10EC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x5CA1E7B79BA0E5518FAEAECDC42D76AF
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x846E9D5ED0E32D17CCBFF79F7A270504
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xA9F86DFAA96A9C38E8B2CB983E009CF1
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x96F82140C3F6D51964D8EA29DE46B248
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x1792FAA7C7CC5A2146CFC547C7B0460B
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0xF259AE822023A31D0929C54169984EF8
fortune.
0x51215F0079A0693E044B327B25F7CD0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x8FB36E05AE4A7CE08F8A8A21F6DDE514
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x805F2817B4718C3902DD1329A927078C
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x6D3C5E9CBADE2168A3AE01C5BB9DBA33
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x7C4870A2857BB1D551A01FE4998F6E8E
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x0361D4AB824DCD199E4A4DFDE9681299
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0x34EE23DDDD6B5001C9556D5A3EFC7A7B
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x4C357DCAC2C9D50DB3C22D31F70B837B
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x9AFA72CB3441A553EC8E7F2203000CFE
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x997C1340A5591C32D24D8BF1AD1CEF58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x006FC3F4BC6E21431F28C489DF44F0F4
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x5EB328D464E8CB809EEC5A7691A4E017
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0x363B0A6FB8455180A43B1E342644E71A
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0x41275DE2FB717BBE3AB417527CE85328
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x1CC513D323081B681FFEB2B0E05A17B6
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x68AF8052030C877BE99BFF6D47D10A60
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x2BB5D9115B8EF5317622527487B69C59
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0xF4AED9B9296551457C4678EC91EC45E2
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0xD1CD368A0814F383BC720984A11B011F
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x1728A89ED23722E0FA2BFBC2CDEAA37B
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xC685DD50E11E0BA566F93D34BFCE2377
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0x15568CDFB6A2A3855217E6BD9C7C20B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xD0200FFEAF3F7763B55D66B0FDCC9E9D
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0xDCBE8EB20BCF1761A33792E7248429F1
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xB073F167FFE4F6AFB23143B6DEBC2D49
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x1C528AE20AF1E09B9BAF1751BB55BD30
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0xF156E0559FE6DA32207BB137BFD65A0B
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0xE5583A8AF412D68995AD099E3E74AC2A
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xC44C27105C7639741826A9FB8DA8F002
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0xC373E7703CFEEB3D0C5656804BB4651D
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x6C5DBDDBB05E576061DB92C9DA791E1C
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x5976889C78C5AFEEB1D54C7EA86EDF57
don't doubt it."
0x04A2738CF30D1B771F4A644548046085

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x4693E3824A3C431F9E88A685096CCDDE
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xA4BB5EE011B8558EE58A32898757BAE5
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xCACC9F0423949FDA59AE9F1475464322
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xA9E1005756A54DECD1FC4E622FB4DA3B
both her and me.
0x79493DCD2EED40103A456804611A7989

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xAA36646AB00F3ED5F4A8A81C0518E1A0
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0xC85BC54B5BFC432407329081A4671AA7
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x243305D6DF7F1DC16AB957D2A461F8E1
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x6DA4D41EC87323DFBE5AD0AF20DB2257
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x7058076364C90F100B12682DC1F80116
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x0077C7D404AC78DCE24976139D87E33F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0x0F1196DD7CADDCE32CC81F0650C9950C
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x93089A42994CF376EE9BF3685286A884
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0x6BD1DB4F69E8D7E6C1270695B145CAC7
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x468FEFABB0B95C4FE2351653EA7A0945
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0xA2109F42A4D2DDE3E710E1EC5C74E239
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x2463F89B076A80458437CA90EE48C1F9
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0x6E0F05F87E1D5648761E4232C9FB7E7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x37C2C1D990D1E8B644A564CCACF703BE
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x738D3E07F9F0D0051AA30F8D1618ABAA
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0xA449EC32F7F4DCF6AFF31232D61A6B96
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xCE90D1D3258B771738F38FC341118F9D
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xD7F78137EFB05E63C45D5D1E53680BAF
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x50975525ACC400F2C02ADEEA65717523
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0x1823E47CBA12C6B57B8054881954C462

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x39B39540220869CC1B9465721A905030
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0xC05E343AC155344E7A284B819A6C0F1A
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0x397C6721FB8AB8CE66EC3AA6EF8CCFDD
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x8F0787AC269BE63D6796816254E9A491
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xC84EF1A50663B481E2A6C852D5821B74
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x46453A4C97548DBFF64DF9B41F7E8992
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0x3185D721C5B3B08A190565311319E18A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0xB7ED9206737243697784BDFBE57C4542
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x6C10EBE8355E5C6C3B1C6D9286420C1C
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x375F78A066D6888996BD850198695B9A
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x6018AED7C830AB61D4464668AB0FC1F4
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x7FB73AC4678273048EDEE9AA6833D047
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0x269BC46663953C91DA3B36A7D971FF0E
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x6E603E00184EA474E7432683E03B76EC
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x849883A5F052C4739AB165E8F46A0723

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0xE4F1A2EE97270EB1AC1D13E87DD759AB
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x4B7DA5F5FC2F299F0E39860341471BB9
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x91C263BAB0CC9F1ABD5102B7B7BF1C51
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x68A80A6855E099608CF1E051F8FADE2A
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xD433FB4DD2512FF3AE3E5D4CAAFB7419
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0xC4C9711BC6C015B1BB8DAC1783C70AEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x749120C40FB4183C2264F91358661DF6
are!  Come on, if you please."
0x0C12DE62B4C1FBDDFAEF163FB53484A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x459334EB79A9F64131EA38FCBCD90BF9
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x6E770901E045CC108C71F800BE8E53F1
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xF7A02B2396D4CE39CA95C75F89FEBCD2
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x42483B3FD65189361F4FE3C0366190C4
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x2EC100A9F7AB5358B01D72C9CDA3F0D9
behave with decent composure.
0xA9C5AECE82C5963C7D181C23A7B2FF30

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xC764118991CF7362D64336D2C6CEA38E
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0xFD34482614CC6D198CED74D81EA36223
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0xD250ECD36E1A2184ADB77FAA23EF30D9
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xCA21CC5B1FC0B2D68442F961AB9D80EC
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x5D82D13706F2DFCA18615E882CC7853F
month?"
0xD7854359C35A7FCBFF691A40D1ACE2F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x758EA78FA03DC1F59F0278C493FAFE39

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xA8F4B29063D74C239B7557DAA99E0593
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x9FD5AFEC211742159A37EE8F347E6DD5
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x5B2DE5F7A9840D4C7502E01307065EDA
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x5026FE07C8FA3F6FEFF942A6E77B9F70
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x9AAA6DA5D7FD75060C0B0F484DE3BBC4
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x4C9E011D91946C14CAE3C53CBA59500A
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x839F1E54598F64BF9B9D44E8D0C8ACCF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0xB3235D721B1C6392B02D829A5F8293A9
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x6D51AAD81B8663436D5CB837CD90BE11
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x02BDD93F467CDEB72809894FAB586488
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0xB49D99B019A6A77D13F5B23FDF6A5B5D
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x6E73A65934504CEBE3C08CB69CAC419D
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0x2FE925C05404003273548DE5AE5B124B
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0x3266498D133C972CD55DB2BD2F86478F
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0xE7C2FF324D316E91404BAA86A32723EC
that it were my home!
0x85211E2B05520C22DD2A2164A2E722C3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x428264B5D15BFE6B83B320BF5878A54B
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0xD673C1891FAB9CF6ED23A6FAF3E2633F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0xC0539282B2EA80E7D21986B04638341A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x59181EB613F6B5FD2A7C8978D10056FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0x71FED03BDF0BCE597E5B50650B4FC303

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x59A62017A800B529E4114876269CB982

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x0F95807313F68E743014A0FD274E8C44
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0xC3134BBCE5AE250BE62BD2579927D29B
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x327CE955C24F9A7C8D51F27DEA1985FF
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xCD73015AFA681CD784DDB487D3F12169
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0xD5BFB358CE5EB97428BE639A8D5F4484
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0xCE4160D9E397DA4D34910787F022A909

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x177371796697ED207D2D8CC9F1666614
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0xC18AAFAEADD27D7DB67EA08D234C9ED7
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0xEA256F229DB37B48226B063F3F680D58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x976A047AFD60EF4E7BBF33991AAD0BA3
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x6777B3B8766E0E921879CF69AECBA02C
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x4C31045C4E69AD206D8E904AE2C1E6A8
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0xB355E23A46779E365C699EF94BFA5F35
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xD4539B24707B158345DC08DCE1F544B0
shed it over me now.
0x0F6955D48230BBC535001E5E865EE42B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x645FCF895A86CE0641CDD0F8BD6BA98B
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0xC703DFF951E81B4272952D0C42FB4793

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x46F9DD192BEEED51BB22B103837E6A35
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xCD8E7936D8ED47D9D200534132F2AA6E
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0xA0E905F1267D7590D961AEE1FB018808
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xAC25CD931445099B071F1656BF1074CC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x3DC74250BAF9712186E73F883A3AED9F
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0x7E483961CBDD7C058EC3321D7400A1B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x085A993B898D00CD6E4FF3E7A57CF070
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0xCC361F126FBB4D59BA30807F34C9CD7A
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x6E664FBF679F5ABBABF3C6223B0B0431
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x731740CB7B0AA3360D7E6821BC59973B
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0x8C130BBB0BD29E6C47FDC6C1C9DF6FBB
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x03C13FE3B99F6E3FBCFB1F4C13A05C05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x5D40171CF3B65961B87912B5E7EF649A
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x628A7BC1CC2E8F362E5667B57A17D046
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0xAE1A40F521D946BFF6F6A810AD6A8C35
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xF842370B24860B5F4269DBFE0626CE09
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0xC3A589FD66E85B6E5A4E7839F292F321
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x4CE64C7DC422180D4E53AF7DF1A9D511
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x1507F4E7C98687BADE53F6814DD6604D
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x038B47BBD7AA9EA1450C288C13B8BF04
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x38E765386950D8F12CB93A8C697577D3
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0xDB5B0E5AAA15FE0E6E510930C8BDF3D8
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x0C9A2DEA46B9AC5E2766B8BE43D271E0
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x8D843AF4595821298A0BD8AFB84EAE52
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x0369B1B619C39270263FB3E39841409D
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0xA0759EE09A04E2F425566FC02937775E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x7FC0CA0235C6704B5B6EA034B49D14DF
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0xC358AB32CD1276F8F95B6394DA57A2AD
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xF41AB092C04BC3DFB999C8324DA59351
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x9CE0A6088C02EA39AC561020007FE47C
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x5987F381D8E1E5F5CF0DDA3BB9B57DBE
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x19C0FAA931E76DD77762A910B8EE9300
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xAFE0B4382F4D14EAB961950374C7F46C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x612F91598D4744A51384F2B1E71339AD
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x407B78D93785600768B5A8E93B0543D7
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xB954A704DEE5A1888357DE16B789CDCC
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0xE41FD155C3719F8F1EC85C5EC0A01DE1
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0xE97D60A40FE2D4A5A3E6A687BB37191F
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xE4293770A67A43FBE93AE5A9F4BF0A40
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x32383A523852A61BB06155225D822FC0
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0xFD171A066D79AC379FEFABADDC69DC3B
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x257EA369F5BAE7C0EDB15E882179008D
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0xBF51C844E89AAE9EFB4B01921B2C88A2
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x413275B527F31A9E9C0A2C27579AB6BB
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xBB1183B8764C4E71359EB3E0E7F7A9AD
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0xCF7222903316E44DBB71599ACDFF9463
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x8AF1ABA7DDF6954B354B7C94573FE35D
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x31983126918A9A789ACD9C863061B39B
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0xCAC55F1BC0977E94414D41552803CA46
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x5DC2749CEF8D7AE3C76AFCEB3604D7A9
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x5272471F2917D50981BF2E5F8834915C
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x08300DDD013C8DA61D5D7FA722391F49
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x995C7FEF66EEAF1A0CCF83DA5A608681

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x714578999DBEF998ED8E3705F06CBAAA
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0x9A79EC9BDAAF6422CFE658E82285CE43
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xEE1EF4867745C22F4C3AB5A0A50D4FD0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x3E197BF217397E2F9B78183E97718F1F
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x7766DE6464BC44336B19E07157AEEB2D
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x885B1BD029B6863E816C048C8B94ACFD
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x8A727BBE524415E2BA4930C0C9BABC27
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xBD83910E24922CB4060BBAB6EBA3BC4C
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0xF75BA889EDE76E08534FE03EE352EF80
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xB66384E2290F2CC78EFAD60D6D518402
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0x23E3B491EA7EB51FE13DE4825109692C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x26D217BEE70B31FAC97FC27FB82A9D20
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x4FF6DB3D0E17C4504A549AA531389444
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x9FB794A1610EDFA5A6B11626BB010DE4
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x0E3C81DAF8E6DFD8A7D20FCD42CB4D99
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0xC9F5B30561D80B89C54A81C7F411415F
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x5ABB9E291EABF0C594CC8B92B115F002
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x036FDEF03ACEBC0C7D6BC4DB382366E6
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0x8DC754F5CA949CAFC55EE9CD1C4B49D3
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xEB4A685CF39B91E8EA718E5647DED9FF
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x83DD9FBC29B899B905DE9A9307CCB677
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0xF48814F9EE4039CDD739891897FB7454
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0xE60212DDD9A119C97E363D2C75A20A4B
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0x7F2AF44297816FC89410BCBC31E58EB0
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x87045A3D9751C878DB665315CCD5C48D
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x73A47C9D004C051A91735F8EE015B03C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x9883F52FBF058A6DC6D7BE44901D7BE2
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0xAD5F75622FB418FB25E02A95EBFC0904
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x5E863C5546D13F3D727C899A2E782606
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0xBD743B4EB4B9F67622FA67981411D37F
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x85D55EE46E2CB9D25C3871B6F967D610
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x1CAD3912AA7616DF4F6ECB94695261C6
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x2D5F18D850C576BEF96A920491CEFCDB
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x37D67108FCECBEBC3EC475DE290AD2E0
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0xFF54583B809912866427728BFAD6416A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x7FE88D4DB0D63589BF60C7ADABB67A7C
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0x5189B6F1BFDB64942DD657C801E9B169
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x866918F7019AECFF736B812BCAAEEB04
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0x265FA9F2938B6EAEC11F32B16FA22827
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xA60741E8C2F517DB5334D585303B61DC
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x08331CCB71BF2E632AB77776268DBEBC
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xC5ECBD47CDD2FD1EBA54A244E1377E7B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x217FAAB848F67704273B3FC5E88CE120
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x665E190C2149B963FE1980C37C3B8BAE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xA16CAB642D50DCE65B466BBB1F3B689C
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0x1B14BBE19554F46D4915BB0932C34F51
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0xA9999A9B8F8326B49EC6595A36C0A5FF
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x2326886E6B5E2148647A7BBA1DB8D54B
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0xE9617BB14C31BE37716C60A103ADCC20
turning--
0xA70695F722EE1437731F745B6720B99C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x05ADBC750393768172BAC6E040CD99B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x164EFF033AED7A022D49505DC76BF7EB
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x12ABAE4CF25F685F78F365DA5206AB4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x1365487BF166F10F00FBD4D53300ECD4
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xFFCA00D89876C32573AEE2A73DE05C26
there! he is flown."
0xD40F1E1B646BE1FF8D8413451F2F92B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0xBA72C8EA1B35019AF953089B8E3E250D
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x0A6F4942671E92E666719463FB7D9A21

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x233B79D7D1E49F0BC32EBA87EEEFD994
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0x3B379BC503230977BABD3FCCAD7A0DD7
moonrise."
0xB83719C2565257D9AF16D627547493B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0x73074BC1CA954A0FBB6C3005AD5BE95A
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x417CBDCAAF108EB43E038EA375B81633
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0xEDFDFE9FE76EFF860C196D4C0D676585
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x9EF7F96C3996C88A7F511F77C55A2A04
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0x7F757BE7E6AF344223DF4A649ACE12E2
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0xC9C6AAAEB7806DEED25A1C44085D08E3
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0xB249A6972D347C4653CA4BE972D30D42
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0xD68FA98F257D3119D1F19E86B857A221
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x93F72E0F920CA316F0F4A3893966CE35
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x3F966CFBD43B1C46719254717329E1E3
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x9E068CD25E9E263D7F6D723628D6D502

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x8C00628ADE8F0B7B0F5847EC471A07B9
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x1905611C600EE7583B56D56747AC292C
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x2C769C61C030597F26DDACD4FDF5B3A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0xA9C8A006F03228E7C19E01A67D9C3FA7
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x188DF4070263B36A9E409582F05E93EC
simple dame Fairfax?"
0x59FF06EE0CA4D0B686AE18D0C04DE246

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xC5FB7711C056E00C610845DAB8362C7F
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0xCE90C71A859E328B6A078E80097D4BAA
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0xA5D81C3139944D50A8B0FD56CB2F5C4E
on, for the hour of repose is expired."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you

must."
0xF34C12B89F31BB04295B77F0AF6C5839

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

straight on the head."

"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x3F793B0C01D5BFA5F9DB89B4288E4CDE
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0x24A34E6AFB966AC6F3D536792E158B5D
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0xFACB62DCA52467CE68AAD7C21C819D8A
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0xA7E7B29D4302D139C9248DDAFFCB41F4
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x8674EE928098F2DDC651DC7A044CA1CD
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0xB195C0F9AC6BE53F2970D290C82FFBD2
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0x3A0EC43A135C9FF44EF96F351C0FB47F
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0xEE497749602994212B7FACC4BA76C97D
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0xCEE2201E7C79BD690FA5B7B6848474AB
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0xA04C89B5CC02B1D779056253699FA741
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0x1065D29077A9DF2465AB1556F540FC65
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x4749EF250B71D46BBC840C939F580EDD
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x2FC1D7D1E3FD2BB9696DAC9AF0B15F3B
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x8C8AC12A149041019521891F1896FDC9
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x667CE53008CA79E36F8571A78F3C2EA9
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0xB3F001D2B95F1FBF35D61D4F7388AA10
Eyre, must get a new situation."

"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was

going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to

betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long

I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I

0x910EA6969671EE3BE702CBC63E5D47F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"From _you_, sir."
0x142A19FD1E6BF85931D19C0FBDE06699

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x391D045AEA418C1B8E70D4234119BB72
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x1150E2FBCBC86FC090DB74BC505FE589
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x0DB9DBB5D478B1EE8D0A77579337E764
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x75FD08E550AEDB170B24B5463A7650BD
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x1F5802C6F483A24686F22E05D3510193
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x90A346E26B5EFB2D74E3E578CAAA3D9E
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xEB833C3643BE0464A62CBD27D538F3FC
loved.
0x6F47725122F6292C500E037180D61AA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xE8F0F712F218DE51357EC4C96D8B0E16

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x1C6C32BA7D9C567B8ACC3901A87409EC
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x2B0002C7158D4003002A3BB1544E4087
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0xDC3EE3875FD31A2E60B82B29DDBB15C9
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0xE494A4A487F85027471B43ABDF7958F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0x8709FF38381501E09C9AD68B853FD24E
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x66BDC0FA0A28E5BBB6D200CC61D67033
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x6B8A7D9CBFCB5F00FF97C2E2904D0A54
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xC399E172A2B6355AD00E39103C61E219
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0x4F29552BE0A47EB061FC5EEA1D0AE8CE
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x06E83DFFC11AD887629CFB00927A3676
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x1008EA1DF097EF895DF2DA94E1F4725B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x3718B43C3B85BF82EBFA86716D7B45BE
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0xA847C18CB8FB6C3B5F421C365FDE6340
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x77B2194D4771E5C29C6A6F3DA8BDC936

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x005F15AD0202B6DCA07C4DD0A1CF6AFF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x2C9AB357B748D18194CE7C2247EEF056
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0xB86F95E5F3A1090C21D0EE36F62A7EC3
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xE5191620812E48D6CD46E82B2223F20D
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x6BD3AB954D22B3175C946292FD82A02D
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xC5DE5BE658551D5412FD01E64B0E9B30
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x0635E80F23FAA3F6429DA799F55FCE1A
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x25F4127EE84615DCF76B698F1DEFC7B8
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x34BC07273ED80A350AAE2ACBEEF7B35D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0xFD6CDC865510EE0C29B590361F1C73DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x02CB31216C8CACD39317E82359B1DFFA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x785AFB66A944F5086070C0C4B2E54713
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x24C82E86A795E46B6B805DB6DECDDB6A
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0xC943EF643093D26B06C03CFAFFC61BC0
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0xC301D9388F548458C77A3D3A717750A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0xD97EBE88A264300DA1C21933F8D980E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x511E38F68821FCF86FFA5C596D8A1812
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0x732C79951D2405EFC6929F7F224EB921
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0xE4F4EE5715A07D2A0FCB3FB2BBA56B7F
speak.
0x07935A7AE2EB98072B45B260F6782019

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x0AE8EB7991BDFC3DDD54EAA1E6E8FC2D
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0xDAE871BF23D8D4EA3E467D40ADE34CAB
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x04FEA5894F562BCDAB612947D74EC636
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x80251A84D5B4797AC55C639D6D6F8715
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0x7E5FF7B2662C44D8246F05C64BC2C8FD
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0xB5B47A0ED8F617F7DFE8361BA6A6E134
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x6A3A5DC6B92AB0D011414DC928EE07A2
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x257837AE4A230A4CD1A0C37E5D7486B5
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xA986D9C2CB0B282E56784A17FC63E209
on the necessity of death."
0x5AB0A50D9585CC3DBD80ACBEE34EC033

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0xD6548DB911AED9A3A1CCF63F22913E73

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x4051DB175A785C02308323306515C250

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In what shape?"
0xE6D4896E010FE7E30E88FD496A6820CF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0xEE99886D37DDE5E283B3223C99FB71D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0x291D8E2A0EE151E0F39A222FA8529A8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you will have."
0x2366871A46A77F0D579717E38D30D497

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0xB5E6DCCB549B6D53D9B9F545096AE331

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x62A2447AC6B93B62FBD96041646C6CE3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xF1F33F18F3FC2DC7ED97BB20BDBC631E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x719D325745229A4DCFBDA51768D45CF5
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xD400D46C6EED2A77F6A32E01085387DA
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0xB022A55EEF755D01337CA5CFAC457FE1
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0xB0A47A42A31772B1925B3DEEFFC5A69B
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x51B9A41195AADB754FE346535EEE45D2
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0xC0A1A7B34F2B6F91AFA97257FF57FC1F
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0xEEA4567A5A5DCCE25B66DAFB2250758E
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xC94328F23C2E2AD05A56A3B88E74297D
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0xB9FE1374DB110C236E4406673C3059FE
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x13FA0BC99EF252D45145D96769BFC70D
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x9DAB3D6FBB8E502E12F7992D08D429B8
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x15DFB07379A2BFB81F5D263529A3F418

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x02A2B3B3AAC5B2A5B4523FE92D7D3693
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x135E271AE45EFCC190A561E231A62CFF
Jane!"
0x45281ED6F1DB61EC885E14E884759A80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x79B9F19C527BF19BA0ACD817FFA79A76
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0x4A6E92836CC20CA8FBEA104A172B6589
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0xD78FA0E28A3BA854FA0D744E7F70141F
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0xB953C93E8B234F46727E9757B00D843F
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x097911F76254763670D39A1FC6F0F18E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x46E3C159C62E607831B374283C49F5D2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x766534B410770F46F66CD76D46166EF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x57A3E1EBD5A3850E58F8C4DDF2650700
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x7F121FD443AADD3C077B6EF85F92022C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0x4E6BA51920D517D1956C9947B4BEF8B1
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xDD69DBFD454C17393D5B161123F4BF18

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0xE9F70C622FFDF45373191F663DA3B360

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x596DDCEA79849BABF85F00000C4377F3
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0x42B461113F149371E4711AD8F427C34D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
0x8F6BCFBD61217549F55F2D56ED03E952

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0xA44E0EC46DC4520DDF8698E32D281D45
best earthly companion."
0xC25B4B3368202A55E12C2125C39D2C0F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x577A8EAF51AD7F1F770F496C9856DCB0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xB62A33C9C390BF0EC7C5511B4C83FF36
too."
0x394EF44144A629F340472C535CD1A3C8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x7B5494D0E059D4C2EE0188EABE7979C0
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x9B0E7BCED8C67941D5534D616FFE5523
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x2E305427E19713EFA17CCE1DA064E60A
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xDF018476609BE60660EB9EF6055A8054
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x53F351C5F9547714F96C333D21284471
said--
0xDCF95D24795728D92DCC8E0069262D13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xA5EDA299610DEA9DF53BA1683B719918

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xE95ED92B285FA32E2B51EDDEF746C68A
return."
0x5BA8045CB80F80EAA7BA6ED7FF50B79A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x8D31F7D8CF83BC51480C78482B8C4213

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x6D071526DA49D6FC0454E74C66142E43

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xC4729F8A4E72DF61718DAB99A777812E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Your bride stands between us."
0x21C37C9D37EF551B25811B3D2F5AD9E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0xAE666411E6ACBF6820075D0CE8A44D1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xCC235D7B52D60B0B441A5C85560E3DB5
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x149E6F85E4E672F244B71DD7F4B39C97

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x1072134343B29707A52D1F96D91D2BC7
was still incredulous.
0x5C17803C471794D23BEACA16B52531CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x71DC391A9AEBC3C1EF72229BE02F2B5D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Entirely."
0x43757B2841AA1EBB0585A7073E837EBA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have no faith in me?"
0x9700BB05F00A7B36027C8533A5E18FD4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not a whit."
0x774008F0076735D0CEA443C70C868218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x86B5E6CB1A62678919A61860CE4EF734
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0xE2D4668D7D78B926F020F8B68C694704
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x78FACBDDB8050E41E292A86B8D543A55
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x8953D7F8CD88AA1F0545361EF43F178F
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x5F854ED1E740E3F0024802286B848BCF
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0xF6EF56CC4ABD79299A2E43C7E28EF9C2
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0x5F178094D10197DEABC3E50AA2728AA6
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x9FB28B8F3AA38E63B68C3DB738359BB4
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x9C954947EB5368ADCFA4B45E785021A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0xD9AB48DADE75928FCBA6C46DBA06934B
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x0548B54BA3697E4FF794157FBD3D041E
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0xF23A9B4451B0F4FD01EA6B0460402775
given me?"
0x622CFDAD31E5C0736D3D6AE767DCCA5C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x68D49155D3CE8BB59CF8DA060EE78F16
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x40AF90493F378235CEB18FC5D85BD66D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x7419AD669D71488AE73F0F5DED66FC2A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why?"
0xC0DC147323FFEE0B309F7B3E64505D52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x3467B8ED337F916042C73BF292CB6798

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0xF11B9FB52E4697B683EC286D9ED3E4CB
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x3C5CCF1756AA28E30266F8DF02262B57

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0xFF7D9F64485613E3538D67B8CC9A7495
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x5AF7192AC64E37E49A6AD61B0E41FAF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0xDD9FD050B0E3A299C89580843BCD0EBD
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xB4E570D54D30223EFC8453CAF00F14C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x3BA5581934B8858F2343F9612532913F
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x0CF1CCD8048D58F4640E9E289EEA6851

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0x458856D2BA9F978C0FAFED70F0A86809
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0xBB26095F4245C40D5B6DB72BC10FA052

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x347DE0ACF6B03CC477C72AA3ECC74B0C
be your wife?"
0xE9CEE2B850F105567E7DB2ACEE0EE058

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0xCE7CC053E187EA457CD9897960DF9F88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0x49E5FA36FFE3DD98A9D111861AAF6DC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xCE540C9C39B119EB0E4F425BC1BE1E96

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Dear Edward!"
0xDADF8FC02E11424D75C710C86C555C64

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x6C58B70DC0FA9A188DCE2FE53BC2DB0A
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0xF2554277E13744A3415F8E09C8134904
happiness--I will make yours."
0x0AE317A598B73BEF3F22789547215054

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x2EE303CE8FBF4374291FBA36C7476550
have her, and will hold her."
0x47CC904C35257EB15FD4B0C1B9E87649

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x364292E5A28F23C3B719E016523203B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0x74EFFABE5CC7E452B4CF81FED427F0EF
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0xC1E84DD6602BBDAE3ACB65A21E5EDC31
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0xB7C451372003DD48E4587D7FDD63B365
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x8C6609BBA903992425EC2CFBE55A92C5
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x1F5058D78C0E92CEDC5344D2A0BFDBD1
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x93E0A68CC96DBA95999A48F7C05B989D
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xBB5D8AD8415F4EF78C18E9BDC172DDB0
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0xC99E2BA6B3159E733B29E6542B4507EB
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xFDFA11950F8128BF896F864E7A142006
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x7BBCF21DB47302F5D503182FAE78A2A8
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x12F7F771858F456E5B4295E64DB47CF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0xE4589DDC4D483D2583D0A7A10082F64C
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x2319C8B1B23B4457D64C50B4AD85E586
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0xA1DC93B1F1B5AE1A668BBA98F9734FCF
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x9888A5AFEAF4368AA16E85AC8253CF05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0xDD3847AC62A1A0D33FD7709977EE0BA9
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0xB418DAB6D8993F5C409EFAA1D681A60B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x37C9A5CC8BA952EAC336C8BC88647346
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x9CE82EF73D60D5C4599E581501F8877D
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xB03809B7668D1965C249FD649D49EB45
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x98064875143A1730DEA834FE1F3B45C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xE81550FDD0544D86160631126DF17E0B
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0x0EA66864E751E8683DBCEDD1FD8C301C
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x516F3D67784735E7A9A6D7C1DF95AF31
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x16B8387104B977269F1C83859A7F0923
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x4068971538A880CAD638D43A3EBF2F6F
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0x545DF6B8EB1F463F2E3D4E5919AC9449

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x5138C225E9AD005B2CD6782F76E9CF75
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x084CCD45BF32177411E865314ED96998

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x61B568F92F826E816993F5B4604387F7
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0xCB7F25C3CADA4F9C25D2E9AD0243D4E1
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x6FB21060CC4DAC49F11D93BDDE59525C
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0xCC82A1BD8EFA801F412D6697E971F86A
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x3DB819C183053264188C4AEE2A1A91AC
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x8CB63A73A6671136FD5E3EC62A77FA1E
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xA414F2863D9DC719F11D59A351BE5DCE
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x28278394656EB46E30DC942566D37790
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0xFFFD101B5DB9B0F27EC89EE97C3BB353
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0xD51F6C5A2EA5C665E812A0C4C785CB7D
strength for anything.
0x5F86B9E5A1F5E4AB3E5A455A5FBA22E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x5270991117396CA930A091D95199C19A
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x330B0CB8AAC751517259C5B9AD6BD06C
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.

CHAPTER XXIV
0x13FCB6394112BF1F773D44707A36796A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x54280CD118C5E89C0EFC3C17C93C5FB6
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0x93EF9DBBD09E537BF15F4E17144B9BBF
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x304F975230639D42780ACC4EB49701BC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0xA5820D0FE189E2410287F358DF636822
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x0621E8651C501C19CFB5961D72550283
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x83EAB4D7BC14AD32227A873E518032F5
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xA501386990ED7E4DA19B4C2B11D067A5
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0xA238FDC7FD85566A0D56411DD3B94F40
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x258E211E30FC1D7C55EC07D5ADD4C43B
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x2124CF39B7EE303F87D9ADE2D55C813B
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0xD3BA5924F7B3C416653F6129FE4EB0E3
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xC174D3446E40E17E3961391549BBC92C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x360EB3946251E5329EC295D78C3021F1
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0xEEE06EA1CB20EFE1816C97A1003AE521
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x933FF8DBF253FE7D754FA866BE17218F
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x3F6650B4EA0BEF9FDCE0457C41CF25F3
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x1A90F131D7C814F750F8A75798C8D3A4
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0x65BF92D64D983349A734C99E3435957F
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x3FDBC4FBE610A817D6685BD385FFD38C
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xCDAC21BB3AACCB32552E8CA6E1D7C099
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x64F1893F9ABABE5DF62C0BFE45C81D69

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0xA3F317290804F28E701653DFEDE5D392
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x5C0D07C70E5D9A378A499DCCFC76283C
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xF68018B38EB3BA07698552BE7ABC43BD
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x5D35CD42914F36C4F6922C5EB1531E45
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x79D5E646F20B24AAB777DE75977F2F56
schoolroom.
0x10C0D6A92112E5839C097C36BA28B3D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x0A485FB7159A843F2DCD6DB74B774593

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x6ABEF2733E4E93905FCEA9A2DA367899

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where is he?"
0xA88FAA23FF84784ADAE6D68AC53FCBC6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x489F54A2A85B269272F88B471159C4B6
there he stood.
0xD4B291BBCC1EC611C44623293A1F09AD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xE48BF381BA9C5ACDBB00016F41BB6AD6
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x158FA9021EC853F7BD3B041550807DB9
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x7F7902759AFB799F10AD938E352CA1D1
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x1035213B311AF8C89B3EA229C533257D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x939BDFFEB3DF4380B4E1DB1AE664B42B
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x91CE51EE6430AA22BE070E7136C905EF
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0xE6EFF6A70CBB6B6A4D27341927767DAA
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xF75BE70943D57795D0D7211B6CFD61D8
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x1F9A03D4B0EBD70B4C8A05F5ADE6A3D7
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x42703979F828ED029C9DC1E4F7EE0B60

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0xCA363980E9FA652E3D6245040E7DDB42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x71876D283929D216832C9ECC7EC13338
more.  Do you hear that?"
0xD2E8184DD85664D3680AC142B99985F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0xA77803363FF7BDE9EE288927F2259BA0
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x8A2792159D234137A45947756B2B73C7
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x0C77737615C59A0E785B92DCCDB44E6D
think almost fear.
0x764BF4178E121F10F070308F7C82448E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x8619C60644A8A5D0354958781817AC14

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x471CCC63E3D3A8D46D0992356BDFE839

"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax

Rochester's girl-bride."

"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0xC19EFEBEA25B9E521B5D909099E894B9
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xCE58CE4D5466D79A02D617C4A0B7E77C
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0xEEFABD9391F3828800CA3CB18C0D1FF6
a fairy tale--a day-dream."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x5F7FD2F70FF4DFD1C9DA17186F0D40F2
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x55BDE9109C9930700E3896A49C06D94D
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xC5EB93B107C8A82B8EEF47D0C55D617E
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0x9E1E5E912C192CFF54821FCEEA5B2F69
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."

"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0xD712E511F33720E3C326B1AD4438A696
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not

have them."

"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0x012F5882902903AB3CC576575982C12A
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xFCFA26756B770FDE138E893B2CE60DBB
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0xDDAD543AE18A2962F52B8E4AD9565A37
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."

"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x0B366FF579A3FB6733BC05E7360495E4
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xE05989CD6E6C827E2181D6E5C0455542
Quakerish governess."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

heart,--delicate and aerial."

sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0x6FF104FEDC77AEF07B97E0C90F74CDAC
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x1CB123B0E0CE57D8065321BCE47C3AAC
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0xFA7F1386F896CD4D108806C47596785E
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x86FEB548046D6A0B8A9C013C336B0801
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."

"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x0E002D7474EC06DA068F191739312FC6
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x353D721D0C9CF1090D0FE6AC2BD02342
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0xECCA92814DE2EF03BA46B03830761092
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x94CA7443FD5EB7270F42A77AAD4FBBCC
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x0700D8FE1941D32E0BAFB81CC219DE86
flatter me."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x8E204AAE1CA7D28B3C72EF18BBE17D80
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x856C629AB1B84A747AFAEB28F6745CDA
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x3E1E94E023FCDCC2E90A590EF72A135F
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x8DF29E99503ABA0133F1112B686B830B
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xBD5FAE95A7A8B95868D92B81D62D10CF
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xCEB96CD230730890D63E53A63C095CBB
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x9A6D0A861B428FC0B48DC47E8109D914
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0xD11CE6F5006A379E779673C94DD4C40C
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x78ADC971F6A5E28E2ECC958BABB54F2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0x1F88209D72ADFF59DA439F61EECE96BB
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x42C5CBB9A03E752C8739B1BB12C1AAA9
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x1B45FFE82FA3C474895B6BA14964D3FD
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x9344444A2669ABB81ED4899BE68156CD
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0xC922F535B41FC7C4C80F3A9AF287B83C
as my comforter."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xB6E619AA157791450476DEAD168C6117
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xCC01034DE91127D97633146F5AF9F72D
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x90402A0CBFD097611B7A36E6170073E6
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x7E181E7DC6C09C401359C229B6AE94F2
anticipate."

"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x1F3BBAEDA33BAB317425030CFBE9F57D
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x195CA9BD65115447C6F05DDAD65BD23F
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0xBD089D7FB2F3CF012B420D12C05DE9CB
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0xEF2DA86E7C88CB2DB29C155668DF4479
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x649681A810A6B9DB24CA4FAA37F97C73
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x1FA24BE41F795328D4C174FDE4B03C1F
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0xE1FE948E64C69D5BA3B24E6028C4D889
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my

dear master."

yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_

you--with truth, fervour, constancy."

"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I

find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a

perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x8390C7AB3397E6FA3E28A5AEE95B0419
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul

made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once

supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."

such an one?"

standard?"

0x3AA27EC0C11C623192AD6E48F2965433
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x3A3929BE9056EF9C20D91032DF1BFE27
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0xF1187818D22718AF12F85045A128A23A
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x66B8B685CDE8C4EC1EB6E0FC0AF482EF
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x48CB2BEF7CE5847FEE33884B84381E99
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0xD1CD18AC3466FC1D59FEE179699E9B55
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"

gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x98402FD2DADF66CF20DF7E8D8FECDA06
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x8B87D2CAE67E6B0AE59AE56F26631E78
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x2545BBF5D614D6E926EAAC3C5B076CF8
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x85F25C63F3E437879757680E3F09C945
pleasure to grant."

then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.

a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."

think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much

rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your

God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't

conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x9E7EAF3C553BB9033B7BA0906042754B
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and

entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xF465EC6855CA274FA292F0F55E3DF203
of my power?"

have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in

some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled

0x3FC427C8C8DD46A59F494FAF29097FA9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0x3CF79097F2EC2BBF9CE0358A37A5717B
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0xFDF4D36F37DE659EC76EDEFB75236C70
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x64B756AB866E48C271E2721CC4325D5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xC84E1DD78AD083D968373562375271FF
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x7C7B30483A28BDB3F5AB532BE17167AB
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0xD6ED6785FFADB0086BAD5EE172156CAD
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0xA437888E3B99FDDEB32365A7658EEFCE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0xBA9732840C90D70A7D0C51E12D533BB7
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0xC8BC7EC514FB89AEB0E67A50B9586E37
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0xFB96E08E34DBE1688E3469DBA3665090
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x25828CC8B54296384FB9BF0DA4D50ADF
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x03CD436825D1103DEF87EF9BB13FA94E
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x0855AE09B23FD916E966E61ACB5CA503
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x0C1AF8FD929F64AF17B3CCA3C0BA62DD
made me the offer."
0x8B120EF83746C10071043A580A306EC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x6590D1F30C8AA9CCD7CE9E5615387256

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0xCBD23DE7614B03B1D02F3294DE2FB3E9
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x957A80EE2E8A70365C26C8FFFEA52EEF
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x8CE06D29716C0083F44FFA2C37CBAD2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x5489A4D7DFD7313D855155AE173C2A8A
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0xC26A4D67F02DAF4E807C3BE4413118E7
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0xEE7A545B398FF453297F7B1594112875

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0x5AF1FFF7760005B7FCACB88937F0B927
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x29F39883BAC202C83392AD7AE971CFA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0xBF60C9F9A98E1736A15D1DCBBFB640B1
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0xFA3FAC764CC1C5CDECC0530AA3109BF5
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x00D32409C7181E6ACFBD950FD3F2A7AA
deserted?"
0xF76C7DF4CEF61FB377AF3E9410C25AED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0xF8A518C298C0F83F9D19F5FDB9B87146
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x31A3795CAC84B6D1D1696BC29B165CB7
moment."
0xAE9F57FFCD64631B2437B182463C576F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xD1AF995C1C00BACB1B9D4F97BBFC3D33
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x03BA0A35C524627DF522B961C37E7765

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xB9436FFEE594E07DF00EF39D9135C19C
awry for want of attention."
0x454940F9F7FBC58E235A1154C3F600AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0xDF75E5CFAA6078B99EB8B7832001DB0E
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x29D61C660E2F5F2AADE245C13495F01E
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0xF51412B8A2777CD8E14A5D9B64859D91

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x24AAE25C8828224AFAF2F54D05BEDB73
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0xD886A7DCC1C7A4AFD2B04FD1C32ECF88
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0xBBE157973444B7D4B9C96195F2E3FCCF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x4AA003A755055711B0A7B645289225D4
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0xB4D88350106419035937BD94A2684870
express.
0x288E2824E4F2D16B14E105FE12915965

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x6E2B44CEBD6FB1FE56BFF71DABFB8804
entreated, and to yield."
0xAB6E033A046420F4634FE9FD5AB83279

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xC7434298C17FDB2D77861B46EC4AC1E3
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0x47BB177484BEFECDED4E576F93892C8E
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x62C2AFEDD6867675BC14B659176A8F74
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x1B60A119BADCE20EC9F8AA6DB94FA9BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x01AA2FE951B19DEF5F1B3DD26473DF1E
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x5CF54FC66B7AE794E2D91C1EA6C9B498
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x7BB67CD072E9C9796BE16637E9648D82
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0xA3349173D0755EB6BE151F53FA832811

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xE45F2AE9D753688FECA9896E94381D64

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x1DED81AAC09C33D4A4F480FBEB4F6C2F
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xC9D69C54463DE0B5277269BBB23A26B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x7CE0142DEEB608FD99D702D4C5A5F69D
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0xDE7BE3E53EA64C311D3421EDF8529E9E
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x2EB8A9547D3F2B0C8BBB9DDED510643B
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x8BB657FA7B0BD424C294F6945FB44FE7
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0xF67C84FC8D1559E22B3A0B95EF96041A
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x4A6284FC92041AD32C21CAD574EAB195
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0xC2381FF006CA9E3C1C4A4D7F1D35F668
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x739FF0B63727182FBC62958C9A09F574
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x1FEE9CE6ADB95F02803D0352594BA98D
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xC99DB208173E178B6A75715EA5372F79

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x49AD415E1B63A5E93931DB7A853144E6
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x8E1D6C19E1BAC547E756F4A41D024C9F
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x3FDBE06F3C92717D7A7F28EFBCEB931F
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x579FB924656ABFBBA780B5946018B46E
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0xB205915429185C65BE8BE936FB5C9675
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xE289A4F5354ED57AD6FED10470CBBF6A
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0x5F6F19390ECB567676804F9CD81A67FA
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x5AFDF867B313E7AB55F5EB4F7686602A
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x8C80FB3E9AC2B365B1EE52D93801C47D
you would be his wife."
0x7B05311D49C13FAF8DDA7003FA9B4C31

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0xA67CE428D42CF044F1A270B188298DC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x40705559D3A1E9FBBA847750DCE5CC53

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x46E89B9C3A052937CB86168E2E1087B7
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x9F39DE0C59402ADDF2669A65210A24A8
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x839D99600CB74D51FD6E1FACBDD4EA72

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He tells me so."
0xE47B13B215F9E3FEBF4BDDBDA6A746E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x95AB89833D927F9DD17B480FF4708411
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x19CDD55C6BB9600C4587F50F9657A3D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x88684CB5A5C0DCDA0833CCB651559CE7
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x201F74C1B9DD12D13E9F60767A2F2CDB
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0xF4E48CAFEEF6E9DB084F1D0707F8696F
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0xF2DC1A273BADC017603BBB2CCAFB019D
father."
0x12FD663E70725A61FFD91340B8ADB3B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x5562948EC55B4145C0A7D2BEDCAB15E4
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x9DA6EE15343D119FA240573CADDE6149
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x0AC45A37A9DDFB1654C73D08F76A7C5B
twenty."
0xB3BE6B49B1D90CFE5DDC52BD833EDDE1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x74767FE5F43EB8337A65E3BE133F5A04

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x8AF0FED6FDF2A0F48BB1ABFD9F310AA3
eyes.
0xEB07FE9A0A8E61D0390B2ACA9F92A797

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x012800E5C37793B183ED65154A3C8196
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x752998B21F2F66B5D5D03229F5B426FF
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0xAEB9BA6ED9FE430AADA6F6FC0A2FBE72
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x25CD8F84BADD9E20BA173E034D65ADE7
I expect."
0xB1AC422C6FE5A4D9B1097603B16AAFAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x06B07175A7563DCE198B16F3797278CC
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0xDCDC3B5F0CE0218BFD17B22359F782E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0xDA0EBF73BDDFCE826A85874AF88966AC
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x5FA50AA12CCFDDF73774C94C7F696AA0
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0x6DEF902F519733D3E4E99D03A3D9B0F8
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x1EE08CDB55C470DB3586BC7800C426FA
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0xFCC9EFA2498C9C7EAD5FFECE4485CBCA
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x0671E995A57AE0065A5C42F206AF3A6E
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x1EB150F6F0CF5CFCB47996923752523D
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x30C6F4398B96DE6CC0B6BEC2C1BD6E9A
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x5D225CDA239581DF6536EFB43FA19A2F
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x48CD6C1E12A953862F6580BC4DBF336C
him."
0xD95C162D0EB0B7F2568D20F18251B75F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0xD32288F3F22C69E452532FB234E72DFC
that all was right."
0xE805AEB9265F6B5562E981866022E192

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xC2C0E897047093A8320FE794E6747B86
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x37458FE0981D54E9BD0F1F1661E0E6AA
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0xF25A01A9DA013D8249871865DCB182E4
accustomed to marry their governesses."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0xF2AB95DC720B5E11BF7D5B392FE40E24
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xF7F716414C9C3F1492F3F5360CFB20BB
me go mademoiselle."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my

gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x87FDB2B202AC3C8399BA85FEF0EAAAED
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him

backwards and forwards.

He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x3578D09029C1336FC9BAF9DD41C91CDF
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x35EDE768C32AD9E5096B00E7FF363073
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x091BACA7281704A49DEA3E710FF8C268
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0xC27DD6E12013338B1F53E9634FF05825
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0xFF48CDD4DFCE6D4B4E6960DB717EA746
my face.
0x16CB39BE7733CF0557DDD67010D6F42C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x2521AFC62EC7436FC52174E7A7B51D4C
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xBCE4E03C2E020EB0B3C6AB2BC1BC3AC4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0xCB38234AB3A74600B6F93C624C59757B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0xBE9E9A3625C5878457745776F02FE81D
to Adele.
0x19950556445B6BEEF901C5C53A16A9C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She obeyed him with what speed she might.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x78590279667E772A8D031B0272C7AD28
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0xA9F04F61A5935FB3AC537DDBA099E00C
company--for life."
0xE840031F0F07318E76D37E9B5F43D3FF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xB8C560D930623CB0F705E4E1D53D762B
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x64E74313C19066ABBAD1EE848D906D11
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x5E5E2D255A3143F7E96198148AE8CBBA
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x726092E4CDDD9E9561C75A6C282FF9F1
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0xA2B10256025B2ADC8E2F2512CDA89177

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x7E05109ED8ACAA1DE2BFFB1F780DFA82
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x410F975F69D59312932FBE6044781578

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x68D41E66BB376136663646A2B0551929
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0x1B9B9B36F843686E554EBD941D351D9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x04F27BC0C7C8F1D6419A6C6BFE62005C
mademoiselle?"
0x7263347C836C4DB74183D8C2BBC252E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xFDFB44ACAE344FF603F2060819EF6575
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0xB026AD594D15EEBB2D29859DCACDE4D6
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x885F960693340910CE72F9D304B7AAA6
there, and only me."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x39B9FC101E63A24FA8F0D01528CFFEDD
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x24F333DA837A9D671A8524E50285322F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x8009684A17B3B4C8A942B12A22C66F76
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xDFDB4506A62DE50E422D966DC0304929

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0xDB02CAD2F5B203C14B9F6B151CE73C87
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x41E3C3F82B919A11E69EC2DBE2678B2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x412AFC639E81CA1CE84A09406239BC54
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0xF886AA64ABE681F708D389DA33EF1501
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x6C49CCDA6A8E5131106ED9F6669128D5
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0x66BD17DF842CE41F2540B4013DD3E86C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0x4981F71AFB8C1A34AAE7E7AE68003D9D
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xA447A1EF928DAF06C9EB82150400980B
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0xCC21FF73936D6EF94F8F8CDCE67D8AE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x082166A536CE1FCF425213B2FE78E73C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0xD92BD0615F602C001CB98E234781B3A9
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x20470F2474158D21D6338674F2D16E95

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x975146C23293C5098C773131CDD890CB
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xA892FE1EA22CEF49D7EF21C99ECCF125
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x49E76E03F94C46E1D72A67C4C6210E9E
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x1EC40741C787082DB8EE2372CD471D0B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xC85822E42D445705D0BA4EBFEA8A5767
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x001D9DB38CE45B139E85267D99D30575
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x300F0A585150E37C9EB263BFD73C4ACB
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0xF09201C36B5E630DA6C049AB920D8677
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x7204C9B433730CB1EE0CD572A59AA74F
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x85FAFAC64DCF1E108CECA416781FC5DD
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x1D266AC4D5528DB4EFE8524D9EB068E1
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0x08807B6A25685DBDD8956D03ABAEC21E
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x193C5325D61CD5CF26608065D13A9DA3
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0x2A4E918053FA1BA94DCE7090074BA5A6
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0xAB2925F4E6606F37E368D0D701F3DB83
effect--
0x847D2D67A8CE1D423FAEBB74606BBE06

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x9EFE4A2180418BD9F62664C770DA2729
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xDF9FB4D3626F5E87F7F083816820277B
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0xF7B1453FF79433A43956DF93C4DF0A72
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x0714E8D4320404E8790D04A825C3F52E
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x06603B52CD282EF9BFD6D58091460A39
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0xBEFA91FDE06EE9FD614352C9D7785089

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x37ADD74B4C49641B1983730329602684
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0xCAF7339F23406E940251973498986BC3
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x548BB7FCB89EA827355F29F34D4C932B
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0x11A1D7BF1F346DDE585E4496D2636C55
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0xA8F5C6E44B3D364A7B9DD9D96F3361A2
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x3A5C2C43ED09F095E1806D802BB2DDB3
again."
0x5A1B72A89DB9B5C9FC4CE8FDB054790A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x4129766805D7583FF43C0B77212A9738
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0xC27C24BC0672E62B30658EB9F2193E3A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0xFFAE433091C6C2472D5A5AE2B53381D3
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x034718D74B2AE9DDCD4F492514D8CA63
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x200B269F34DC82C4A592104AB9FB8654
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0xB62C34A0DD77094144484C5B788311C5
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x7C03DAE2CD428FD04323AFC38E6EB4F4
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0xDEBF0CAC5656DC2C02A5AD442B42331B
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x0129C8DD3828700865BDA0A8548BFE2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x277465ACE072388DB0ABF43F09AE1352
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0xACB12C44CF1C6FAFA6227CC8FDEE2922
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x6893DFFA3E6144F61531EEE39DC63C47
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x9D725A913F99C2ACAC58EA1B5F18FBF2
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x37744912D8318A162435675443269375
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xF71801A03B06A08C1EB3B9BBEAC1DFBF
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0xBC49F1E0FEA538B67B0FD5D47A36C50A
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x168C3E8E18DC58313C30FE54AD75B409
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x2C5851351604CD7C6B0D72EA95F27225
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0xDD17EA49333E9D9FE6274A26CC665A46
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0xEF888DDAFC016A1C91E1F6EABF49D92C
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x3650017A2C8798CC2F118F648FC362E9
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x4AA6FF98A253D191A0AE00C89CD44E1F
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0x94A2C89DA37413B4F91BD0AA9CDA24DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xC1F581C3F6E7F8ACD1209749E9250FAA
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0xC5FE0ABE10267C6C2302129A0C9A07A3
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xD388FF8C20C7AC75D64AEE50F8B6EDB4
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xDD605E912FEEB117A4536D1A990DA549
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xC4CA8662EAC96E73D7FE180229D04C00
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x8AFBCF283BD3A2D8FE45CDC930852219
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x3B0E9386F0B68CE3B28E04A526FDB30D
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x99A4C0EA8CECB5711AC75A4B598C4791
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x47964C7175E6DCF6D13911CBFD9899DD
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x9D1C126A80744FB8D00D8CA4CFF05DC5
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0xE7F0E9F95E5680AA26050B76A03B81B9
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0xD5F27299E273E15495ECA96F15016600
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x7DA50F22EB0DA281271F5EB1C8AA1210
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x59DE668B28CA668064E623BF53364CE1
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x7BF037A92250988590F105C30BD88FD3
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x3F3D8503AF3DBD2F9E1495216357DFF2
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x334FE0EFF619A21E4C39706C4CA94800
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x3561682C23197E38BD5FBE2B24800DCC
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x5BDF28CBF007683A5C887F84D1BC2680
passionate pressure.
0xDC20304B4D3CA933247FDEA55E99F54B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0xEBB43BDAF4C72D2D78BFAFD043913607
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x0A88BE8B21BE32145E43B708A3F5838D
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x22D7A8FA97789B1A0CDA5B3AEFB40FE3
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x8C904517799865BE608AE3D454ACD252
satin."
0x34692C7FEA4166A1465269D701CB9868

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0xAB91757243FB4D3634F8C12A7DAF3658
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x00D3E8F5982086551B49AE51E40B19B2
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x0E94E493D4CE61A7E7831A3A80ED8D77
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0xFA9BD8DC064F81062BD248D73B59D86F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x4DE0CE9749834DC47D8E33E784D6A237
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x51E10848D9E29FBD1880B97EC5792EBB
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x0E6173D9AC793E0A78E8BF47701D35BF
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x9F18224CDD441F3525DDDCAE778F6AAE
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0xAB9E3FC22CA6E4D11FDEDF10B869653E
satisfactorily here."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0x07CCEF523AC59F4D77C9436D691CFA1B
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0xA10C0ED61FED12571CDAAC46B87D397D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x57E5DF8A789E104142DD47C6B39C70FA
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x986332833FD4A30512E5DDB3EE3E1913
retreat upstairs.
0x14BFFC3368B515928A99E2B153E066D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x4F1A8CE07C560FE48C62A2BD97FB6726
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0x7F204E6C9C0B54887CDBDBF90304F859
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x3D68EB42236559F20ACE2FCED0248871
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x0DFED5E75E0943576A678F85C4433231
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x874B6184382456276AC1A1C8BFAFB4C6
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x138753FC143E49C02559EE470784980D
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xFA4A862CC55EB1FFAD77AA4B4BE718B7
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x1532D825889C0FD66AF1ECC525E24901
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x6EEAC4E36469DEB0E746A62BB46A63A8
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x62E1864270DB84A03AD5B539A6B5CF62
the present.
0x8326D34DCF4D316DCDE4EBB7B5F10B9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x52A93820402DB3D9CB83C786983BA7BB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x8C6DA98995462B0D01093D8781F97202
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xEFCD1304BFCE62619F28E88BCACFB707
stimulate it.
0x13C77C40A0AEF36CBDF5D5937FD96657

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x15039C405DD97D39DD5CC4539D6453F8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0xC55967652C08750BF7FCDF2E020244FC
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xF8A93198CEC4D9F7AF30FDE52A1D65F3
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x1F75FB82C881AA6EF00B91A381F64F4E
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x8EEC735D4C4FB97BE2FF053F9670EFC6
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x699D36F617280A5E96B313D166784E50
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x679888CB40DB23DE6C0C1CACC957BAD7
strain:--
0x2278332244B7876E761828A5F014B586

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "The truest love that ever heart

      Felt at its kindled core,

   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x7D57A395C454EB86E27AD05377F8E641
      Her parting was my pain;
0xB44A7AB9D72D6B7CCC678AB944643E1C
   The chance that did her steps delay

      Was ice in every vein.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

      As I loved, loved to be;
0x99D0F5A8CA7D02611650FD71A86A2AF8
   And to this object did I press
0x87940CF2DA044FBBC99E92340712C15B
      As blind as eagerly.
0x056BD1440718D7DE1BF8D9ECBEA74284

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x94200EF64CA172440D108AB3D1B7F61E
      That lay our lives between,
0xF38D456F5D47B5822A8B3B0AA11CE176
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0x2D913A24145F2498736FB0D84A60A299
      Of ocean-surges green.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   And haunted as a robber-path

      Through wilderness or wood;
0x6D7042D4A8DE30903CC7970AA05ACACE
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x3C1B1C677DD1167F32D9EEFE216EE868

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0xFA0EFC29F728B59285EDB01152E356EB
      I omens did defy:

   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x5FABF9F9E9508D4F8306857C5AA94AA9
      I passed impetuous by.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x06312A02204BAC72264BC858962FD7B1
      I flew as in a dream;
0x44B4621D3D3DB8D3900EA4604FE2CB6C
   For glorious rose upon my sight

      Shines that soft, solemn joy;

      Though all I have rushed o'er

      Right, bar approach to me,
0x803B4BE89C92832747882AE9A07EA947
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,

      Swear endless enmity.

      With me to live--to die;

He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xF358D2103DC5B510E97CCF21E5A4F81D
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x18578A47538B54410C4BACA4465D443A
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x5B103D5515CCB374D489CCB530F27CE3
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x6595CE54D387693EDDD622ECCAB02219
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x3947F524798D7A0704F0A263B67F3F96
"whom he was going to marry now?"

"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked

of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0xF86D040AF0F4263A0D526C09DF45A287
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x44492A87002659DDACA7A50B2E7A2BFA
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0xA550A84A6F09FFF75B77C251FFC694B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x8586CCCD468B1BBCC2A71E78E4205BD9
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x77B6E9C128F2C57DF09E75317B374155
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x7ABBBDCE05F4A13B36C1E685214148BD
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xE413A8B8F0D637ACD9767E6D9B13F9C4
time to rescind it.
0x8B0F804A9CE61A86DDA76AF167EBD79F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x1710DD64320F84359E4B2E47FADCEC42

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0xDB848DD3643967709187AE4EB620E495
myself I was doing that now."
0x1F2140473B32DA13C25BB18E4CDB4821

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0xC55775AD27ABCC1438A2153B6F503C39
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x6CF507859AD2109DE223ACB9ADA9D8BE
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0xC4F536269418046F8BA62B1E513AD377
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0x17BD0650B0D4F78F0B4BF70D85F781FD
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x81686E66342DE49585054E3ECDC0F218
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x5762AE56C23B9FD5DA9434D68CD8BEE1
advantage."
0x23DC8FBB064BFDB6C6CCCD84E722863C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0x563C6814A6E938F94E731EB9C16FF0A9
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x3D97757757CC9D6D013B49E42A5FC9FB
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0xC67761D2539F798332767FE28BDD0BFB
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x7E1AC36A29B9466160DEBED359382F3D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xDEA08895CF1ABEEA93AD3C6910BFB546
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0x0BC7CE9E214DC5800BCBF6617E21ED14
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x5B082355F4B78EDA99DD712F757B3095
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x083BD0304DC5AC84D0534336666AE7C2
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x3A2ED2031E77A1F02E30B3DD8D43F45A
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0x8677B83900A3BD255CB9D0FA663DA2A7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xCA3A5B8D783FC2CDE5F5B1A1917714DB
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x1082C126970249693CDD0E6D9F96F4C0
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xBA325273E71DEE78ABF512E353A4C09D
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x0318F9F3A3B0F3E6590B889643B99CF7
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0xC1373DBA23E2393BDF79DF4E809A4C1E
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0xB1B1839E54410A2DBBCCEB04E753EC65
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0x85B30F1559574E838D5E42AB8F8D7B38
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xCB4E3E7629C151D83A71718398FE6973
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0xA97B7AD521E9610767EF93B940AA0F6D
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0x8A574974ED55228742102AF6E4F608A6
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x600BD827ED823481A24346593F0B8314
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xAA89353D8DD15D07AE6B076E65C771CF
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x0BD3F516083E7E204EE3D2C798717A99
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x088E9010F72F57208FCC555F74C84812
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x2730663852C07966D1C619E88CDB0C6F
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x44AE5454CCB43A08580CAF9F5B4819B8
virtue, another must be devised."
0x1998CA049B426648B72ECFBC47EE371F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xE270B75130045094C7614215EFD31887
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0xFD87510D35035B35CACA0D9BC7975940
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xBF77BB2403606A9CCA71BD1F591E01AE
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x92FE7B040DDC2CF5ADB55CFF8DDDFDF0
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x78F3BA3C1B27FB0553B6B72D8B468ECC
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0xF592D8BEE56F0435CADCB4273CCB94DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x4867C099CCF8580AC5C9F4C7034980F2
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x2C8EBE80A6B98752ABE6CB57A0E3DD52
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0xCD37A7149C3181A9A5B423B3ABFBBC95
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0xA1F94405472EED5CB10EC522C2C2A680
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xF8506E4B82DC274C7FAEA0C5C28477D7
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0xA02AA315DCBF35F95A57F8ED858D5420
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0x49DA585E04E4C89D41C790C976DD206F
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x9B5B41DA922D1F4715E15AB8422ABFC8
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0xFC4E3CD83944E9BFC00E6153D8D88DB5
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x3C8F095A06114EBE5F45F14406DB659E
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x84C9B9C98D99813B34AA0EA722D95192
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x7D5EDDA7CDC7D0CF19710D98FFE85790
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x5C8D979DD974784C68B457735EB74B4B
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0xBFB8FF5E2EA96E0B00D055935428EC5E
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0x27F47026EDB8AC283CDA04C22B1A57CC
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xEA665D78ECB5CA16A3971E4DAA8A2B8A
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x11D2061D9C411DF94C45FAB51ABD5F68
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x40A38DA781D398629AF2628EF7090677
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x1FC9CC0B36E6F106E842AB6F386FE219
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x2456633B000A5DCEF5BD27C0A5823247
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0xDF1F4F9632386A1EE19324DBC0F63F84
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x56325CB5494D2D78D9CDC8FE9CEE4C95
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x35318F9B4F671975E57AC93C901124E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x528730E1EEA305CE6058F9F3F213E881
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x7653C07F899BE391E80E333AB20EDA67
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x8649E01BED91F9E3567362DD3A386FF9
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x67D4EBBE1BDD3B3BB069893861AA3545
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x8B30982321447B328D7BC63C1E1ED811
more than they.
0xED8D6FED1405B38BE51848C1AF4D6249

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x6A38C1D147F3C5AFB6FA6105763425F1
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x96A3DAD1EFC54C3861F4B003AD72A6B4
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x028485271F5D61D6D4CE94A8BCA7F796
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xAE303B75C4B97D529FDD0E749CA3D304
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xDB4E002215C136E29A86688EFB96CB60
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x88E6616699B5F3A22AEDCB6D0FB05BC8
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x2F6CA1071D1B345DAAFD758508C977C1
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x0D843740A8661632A216B7B0FCC36344
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x726EB92ECC14011BFF99269D5457398E
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0x0A19A12786AAE5B961E26A72CACEA98C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0x5AF032762B487B20019586A99510D4B4
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x873D5806648CDA5444E63F20C4475F96
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0xDC663CF12466F297C31B3A42B1B7AD1A
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0xC4E7DE0A3C6D70F5822A9BB7527E4A98
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0x73DF6001F2C0C9D5185F031B33725F65
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x30F331BE6E3E3796CECDB7340A76270E
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0xC39F8BD45ADFD8225F1F61FFB1AB7162
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0xE4C5AEE0AD20757BDD69632BE71A12BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x73C05CA52FE732288AD45E16CCF8CB92
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x5B582E5418A20EC0B891E054694033E5
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x8B2391D6C6FFD56FF52E2E78D5211771
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x17C7EBF98618967F5CA7AAB20BA30908
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x27A4B13B2CB70127FB7B39E980516D3B
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xAB803AB00AFE9044E436EE8F0249BEF1
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x6B681C48C26EEC2D34FBB77FA88A37F4
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0xF060B11B17E0E806C73D9F7D434B9D67
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0xAE90BD7246CEAED5A718A2AF3513056A
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x337577C1B0E292AC99F60234804BA7DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x394C35AFB35CA08EA3ACFBE495417A44
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x2F1504D43672255BB8D67CBACE28DACE
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x347EF2EBDD1BC03BB3B28A59E94DB938
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0xC3C06EE823B496531C7A69FEC5155E78
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x4A2BA752134AAC5A9683EDFDCDA85889
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x93DF28287D3EE983828DFAD18B970B5A
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0xC6063B6B018990D6F0F1807324CD2919
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x1C4D74BA02510C91BDA83F3060A3B788
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x427D37CC923266F14D032961396B6929
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x88854581B7E3D2DC8F33C54A788A4CD4
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x101539F66AE6CE9358BC302B5CC0B4A6
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x2AC5EAF941C091CEFB0ED889D1FEF6D3
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0xEABE5111ED3CC244E832AF5CC5863DB8
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x063A6147FBA051EE97C188B30758096C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x4AA3AD58AF50B812782221BFD9225AE9
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x505DAA7499B355E1074EF6DAD7B9E77B
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0xE53F9F9DD4AF840A8918B57F541C4124
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x29188E3D9DAD1482D7143C0155BE1335
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xEBC613B41AADB42C28DC9A5E506F9FB3
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0xADA55E88143DD3E6F9ED33E6DF994218
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x0AC6A3F6FF97FCF880B90A9675B315CD
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xD4CAB94436B39502437A265DAB2D3CE4
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x68736FB01A3671E091470527D562DBD3
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x9931C7367ACCF38371935355F728D465
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x1867F40653BEB7B151E410FD92A40B16
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x9EAC4992453545ECAB6046972C5F8C14
simultaneously struck ten.
0x84792BB8E6543AB67ECDAB4F2FB083F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0xF52CF3E18FE73BF3DEB27A0838942C7E
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0xED009959983E9714849FCCDEAC9710DE
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0xA8D13636C89FB4D57D4345623FDB25A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x37FA77436A97053C77D329B1946DEA7E
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xA53997584DEB8288C62DD6B024E497EF
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xE080C84159982F4524E0E4F18265C837
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x555AC64ADF7BE6E0D6084726FBE8E10E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xFF41BCBAA27160A3BE8280D8B817FC6E
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0x6A516C0850D1CEEA8BBCCA45FEACE2DB
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x71018BD30338805CE7AFB890355BEFEC
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0xB3765949F8D9E7DA044CE521D0AAD14D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0xA317A61A975818DEF9ECB30BFDE1194C
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x2A527DB2A393187D835FE672F9F19830
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x30E775590D20A747C1EC3A340E6C66BA
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0xFB067434C070F30AB4CAB897517D7E30
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x069D58F6FDFD9B92BE80F6B29DCA5CA0
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x16C8FC1F92BB0CCFB601F7A23A05C143
meridian, and must now decline.
0xF997FD239DE6EE065D0F73CB05E4A71A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0xA8E41F43E19C68235F0EE062103C34A6
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x5BDC6451BF562B1B70CF8E438A6F4652
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0x2C6D375EB24E42D88053549234648379

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x40ACBD344C7C0A5B7CCF79F852D6D7FB
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0x2F1EF58788199D91A1EA30E4C5308CE6
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xB0221307A2AA2ECF72BC7C1B8DCE5C4A
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0x6CFFF6BFCE824ED4ADCD13737E379506
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x30C27C7D6B011C4DDF5B6895F14AFE17
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x294ADA7C99D5855F76FAA9FA54A34E41

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0x05B9EC414CA4CE2714E573BB28CA0897
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x9923C455B3FBE8EB6E9C5BA45AE5FF02
give me both hands: mount!"
0xC3380F285298BC0204A098CEF988180F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x20E79B8E588F27C11CC2C0910094728B
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0xA31C033B7414F5CEDF422802A25CA69F
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x3E460E0259F347BD4D97FDC63552A880
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x945FC449A4C532460B42E5CEBF86399D
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0xBD5D8EA15771C86EF9DC666362E7C6EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xF3CF6BC05F12643ACCA5BF6BA9386664
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x7FA69722554057EBD0305517ECF8603C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0xB53BC8D0CFEB3C82047B7323A00CF6C4
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x097B2D8F83018324528A24E81AA30C79
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x1C4D9F31C7C7CEF2FA0AA536FBC595B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xF60B1E87A81B801D9CB2F0BD57FC2B98

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you have been both?"
0xE13B99CA929AE3B51D34B66D58039279

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x35C9D9199622498B74A45B072AD70BF6
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x6AB23C89BA18696DC7BC09AFE401F9D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x8272183E6611A7579FB9F086E77BFEE8
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xCCC409A79A1EF2CB2234615B4C79C35C
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x637A833C5589A3611CE7590BB99B69E6
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xF7C3E6DA5E4B739ED0A92E4ECAFBD3B1
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xE76ED310A59735B05A5F6268CABE7FA2
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0xA4A7B48633194AB88F6F220883A715AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0x4993B6EAEA60906AFD884B4A27D2BCB2
get down."
0xCBA247F1A3982E3EAA4789F0661EF416

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x7A24A063A5B1691B99FEA4BC80CD1074
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x8CC10DD0396266A43845EAF28496634F
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xC4950A196CB6017F2ED72EF642E1B187
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0xD9BB665EF17F20A313E01EA62BBD8906
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x6E254617954D3B4E8ADBB0FBAE7BB426

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x465F4A150D4CDDB777DBF124195F1A2E
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x736D0F83EDCAB6C7EE8E3A8D8C2DB6E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xC6A9FC27DEE45A5BB19E106A5F132846
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0x536E26E1385062D8CE9411833E351E70
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xFC9D715F1C428A8DFBFBF5DD7207EEE2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x3159161BE43731299C3F4787BD89C769
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x8040A7CC84B1F5350A610B85BAA3DC7F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0xA267754DF097AEAFDAAF5EBF555044FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xD76E97CBD73766DD73EDC08D96C74A24
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x92A0ACF533E580F373BF5243DCBC634E
as a long, strong arm.
0x129BF54E1C377F02EC0EBFE673F5B8CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xDEF1DB9C024701574276CF5FD893E3A7
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0xC389610B6FAFCF88E742967689A30E75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Jane."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0xA77097FE5FE846FC586DC26EDB5EF628
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x343B5C57549C5FF19F39B3822741D22F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is near midnight," I said.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0xEB944B1C52FBC5CFDD6A94524E7AF4D2
my wedding."
0x39C7143D69C4AEEC5A82B0ED7BB87661

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0x701E23DBAFA4EFA75F70015D13AD1953
no wish to go to bed."
0x04280452F4B3FE204BF108028DAADAF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are all your arrangements complete?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All, sir."
0x29803C7391358BE3A974D978DCBEF518

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0x3529806B9B3410C76A3C97EB8294BE92
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x00C337D93CB5DD600A40CF38683D580F
from church."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xE144D1B18932696016CC04921EB208C7
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x7289DB1415567A131800073C968F2179
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0x96593657BA6475FDF3F9FD2D8AEB9D4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0x24B2BE5E2C9E080329D37987D13517FC
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xF851AD1339FD1848A3CB78DE23FBCFF3
charged?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0xCA7EDC557677BC9CF3F1F725581D03C5
over-fatigued."
0x1E25B969A9906A69513AE7700DF9508A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0x4EE1D6B53CE7041C8D6EC225C1D85ADF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x75F6948C9725822E8623AF008D959B5D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xE174A00CB6B973626C58C1E9470CD58E
and flushed.
0x01C3D0D1E9069EABD75F9DBA1B2B1CC0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xC8B4C13D091D3CA21B077DC54F3DACD7
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0x4B62123E2567EC1BD6AACD8C78E4E65E
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x99A4DF840999DDD5210E525FD681D3E3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x95358F45C11B8F2A3E1F8F48267266DF
new life into which you are passing?"
0x6864777089E9AA42A122A077B450E8ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No."
0xCE36EF61FB1B0510BC0DAC4717647CEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xF1668255FEF3B04B5C77944D7E37797A
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x6F779EC55D69D6C548E6C2BB97E3F391

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x9C879F01D142FDF9C21CB07E5DC0D558

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xCF8F66A92FB927036F183F0207BC1EC9
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xC690C2960622628D8C0A6F8F38371C64
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x766D81C81240F843AA24BE73F6112E3D
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xFDCD56648E2EB9FC64CE767C0E77036A
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xBA5FB23F234A03BC5E31D2A0D7ECC655

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0xBABD61DE0358E06011BD3519DC3498ED
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0xA340832A4C5A490A7C68EE9A8E3E1535
proceeded.
0x3FCC5DF18105AD595D6C1B26020255DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0xFBF1AF24E45BEBA123EAC8F850AFC30A
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0xDF57B218933BCC02D807FF0889432B6E
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0xDC99F603FD08D0EE6DC7FF363491196C
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xF0F79E63CF9973EA0A428183C5463813
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0xADA272232187B1AF86F4E93A4FE6AE5E
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x3DF520C44766026C7242036CC7672969
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0xF96227EB99B6533314705C72D1CB58BF
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0xA5B92B96043F231D411944A74BF20565
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xA7AE54FECF36F59A21D60A0237371866
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x930A5665016C7BA13985FB4E90296164
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0xF956C1A8C4623857E645682A49FBF66C
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x5E7EF3E9412DDB497E69F6C9B0B9428F
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x17E2FE5DE40C8B0379A83C700F63A278
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0x60CE6E979A7F30532B498F5FFB670AB0
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x63AF5F90E9A7FE4F600668FE67FD73E7
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x3871A929FA017F915AF657B299D1EB8C
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0x4B34632D62F76B836FDB7398A7F3F244
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0xF233EC7E85EEBB54CF2DF244119BF2EA
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x8C85D74137D3AE90F00C251B06581F6D
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x0A8FA690DC428D9E90666B8C280DDE74
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your

aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0xC74F036C1B88AC95E68CBAFB57A81DE6
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x1B53B27135775BB6593EA458DF5E69CB
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0x5CAE1691FED0944895CC053984EA4DBF
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x4A6BCDF0512411EDD22C45ADB69B86C0
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x87E71BC51B05711EEC4FDF9BD3DBFE49
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0xFA671E35201342164D9B436C2A6AD48A
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x6034061B50B02D78AC4AA69B292055AB
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x16175C53CA8E3DE6084358ED4D71D276
coronet."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0x9E65892CF14D880BEC2D97C490C7FDFE
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x29E7D6EBDEAE3A446B8A3867A9A42432
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x96C8B82FDB93EBC5F4BF81AA5D1D03E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0x5803FE5FEB3354044FB4FADD54F75AD6
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x22A8C26083E558903DADD41EBB9955CB
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x31F95D4D9ABA2FEAD2A46C8847CDF1F1
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x99DE5F35D220FA052E0D6AFCDD6CC304
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0xCE398C8DAFD5922A7CEA30F32D1BC881
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x471E7982CC6E3817CF496E33BF48AE93
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x9AD751B643B431A47256B49991BD4A99
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xB6573DE2F3B8C1049C18D912509B4AB2
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0xCAD52ECC207F8CDC21CF8E82A3B4E85C
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0x4200CC9878EAC9D8DC8E46180C438832
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x4B0050B6DF19E9E91E8AA4663D21E0F3
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xAF2A1F6F39E49F8D3BC1FEE5AE3B8EFB
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0xE68ECECCD1142C6628ACA53731ADA3B4
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x442D3CC94EA952E0871BF8F7D39E36DE
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x618CA29DF9932A423CBE7401E855C0E6
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xB80D763DC4B3FF8535A30EC89FCBAE01
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0xC53EAB9CE020E9FE98131FA5796715A0
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x71BDB243185DF16D28B389AAC7F0498E
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x8517AE0D494B234C3BD36981C382D663
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xD35ED0E3FE95D3B9765DCF4702E5BA8F
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x3E783274C8F2F814C439B5709F3B65DA
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x16583806FDE504A7E513A44E90D1F20D
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0xDBBAE81D8BB25E3707B601E8C7109FC8
moment."

"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xD9826431CE87AA165939D2016CE25D98
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0xB01BFF915C5B4B250007ACE52B24977D
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0x45BA0882D2ADEC3ED80A8C11E6122FE4
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x793F69827F316D6685DA041634F39841
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0x1A798E7A82F71E6935ECF10240506C96
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x90E53ABE07BF25DC7361433F61FEF245
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,

"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x7E53D16DED2E19C4CDDD8497AA215663
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0xBB7FC0C5AC55299CC90023BFCE29BD80
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xCF526E688B4F2584E07D261053FC3D92
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x46A37975BE5C37DE3D957EF1C5ED79EE
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x8C323603CA8B1A0868A9956ACB6164A1
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x67617054C57BA983F0D5901A0132ABE0
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xCD0DA93331AD1282E168C96C1EE6451B
incensed than saddened."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

finished my tale: but hear me to the end."

of your melancholy in a dream."
0xB91F11B393F40A6CFAC79E9C622822BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x9115AD216898208D00F4D96CA9C745DE
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0xE694222312686357F8EEE27BD1BCBF97
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x585E39D991E57B4A8EF987BE4D9FEE6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x063D8C39E81C392E995EF4B29D698B78
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x083F36238FD9BE026BED2A429552DD54
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x960D9FB16D742AC9387DA5B4D0EFDCCA
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0xFE82285807B5DB1F266C1AB36355FAAB
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0xC2CC028B5FDED49032F8C822C210BFA5
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x6B66501A631BB773FAAE7B3C3E8F3604
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x28D5E821FEDCC940FFFB2F0BAEADDE09
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x7C8A7A1D871A3CE0B33CEAE8310B4152
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x351DB0C9A02705106E6A50910FAE9EA2
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xAC3A4F9A61DBC2D29FA348EC54F7BD58
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xF57C5C53367060586A48C90F1E7A9295
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x2450573D93C0B0489920DF45C8BA1C8C
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x3B1FFC0AAA696810382107E0A549A5C7
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xBE5D151B4073E073886C71DBEF875CF6
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x89FE428996E0E62B78E7E9F23CDBEC80
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x3EF090F03713E8C9EAAC34E1FCE63951
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x39C51C6595082BAF1EB779539AF948F8
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0x8959DF8788E3B74E31D0287A3ED4A203
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0xE9BF057767532CCC783615E391A5EC8B
woke."

"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x448D76C32AE55B182DB5C57EA9EF771C
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xBA5699AEBF5033C8C6192DB4FB516240
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0xEEE476EAA7D9026969C09C0F39699DD1
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0xA50E3F24F7720FFD5CC67AE28348D79E
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x6872EADD1435384BA95C5E2F7610F618
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x26012B1A3B547954CD6ECA53F1E3067D
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x1192F28454E53B678983F45E49C301B6
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x4B907188CBB9D26A3D02140304512B7E
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x7E6575D0B99916DB6387838D48FB6E33
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0xA34E433A81883AD4C64594B551FEDFFF
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x184E7FC73AA11061E46649D6ACDBAFBC
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0xFF914ECEBD57A614B1B2EBAE6C9BA534
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x6C4B3D8F22AB3B299B371EEC4C7883E3
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x7B60A61D72550135D36300BDA0AD06CF
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0xC0C4F22FEEE601C9D32F776A43F84E4C
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0xAA95E418DAB196C61DB76384322633F4
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
0xADF11BBDDF16E9DAB553BC075F3FE14D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x89D199164FB42F2C4DEB318A0DA8C953
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0x8647652E0B650EB9FAB2A802885C5F86
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0xBED86727994703527FDBBEBD1E918DC8
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."

"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was

a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x2EF5267B4642F288C97F88B46551B4F6
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"

furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall

approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x2D6BD5FBA8A5BC7C28E82EDDA75BF3EA
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xF8C301A0007489846E59D0715234BC2B
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was

transaction actually took place."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
0x0DC258D94EF715B16555AAB3B7E1BA4A
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x4D4F474A7262C243A4F639CE1922B433
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0x810E3D167D8BAF782D3A1E89014D5F1D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0x40C1AB751D8C0EE140A2A10DA3748F1C
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0x381E735F3ED2B86B2A949570E92CF97A
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x4287756A8D58529B81290C7950AD6C23

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0xA8B8FDEDC929D970F5BDAA8DD1990358
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0x0C82184D7726DEC32A0F7C96E53024BA
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x84E9BE4FC6C002592B4C9CF6C8CD4C8B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0xF3E90C5381B8F35E649856E0CF117F4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xDE0EE685C12E3B9A27C42F6994BC2394
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x27B551F7622D4DCDDA2875EC8D73902D
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x0BF659E6589402052D995A26070557BD
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x2BD7D50675932F9D048D6993EA85CA9D
to bottom in two halves!"
0x788B5B3BF13AAF21A41CCC0533874555

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x40AAFBB8811074B3952F99257344DF41
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x2DFB86E4614DC47D22CA44B306B1356A
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0xC391CB0A4379440F720386F06FBB69D6
might have happened!"
0x4D980EA4307A6BED1A3569F4E033D666

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xA23BDB8093AF7367F601B919D2189D6D
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x03C184D52925D5C6F2028F5EC849926E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x037DD81DF8CD959E9BAFB7C3AE56D8B2
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x24135C77C0B44D9BF0BDABEA964C4F03
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x7414357ECD3700C59933A5E4FE0B90DC
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0x50C22124D58AEFD073ED22FA79D58059
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x57AFB7445DF0055C7AE773CC3E7AC403
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x073C4F17AD9DB5867BFEED26F8239D16
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x98EBDE625E8E0A7DAF18AC0EBC4104A4
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0xF1EADE36B90E43FAE6DAC340B9091B93
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x6326F2F42ADE67CBE591CDC94A96D28E
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x529A03DE4108064A1D9EDC795C07E721
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x49C3011BF01AFA0D76A5AA02B7CE04F1
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0xEB6F16BA9BD2CC499D4BBB78D6914806
solution of the mystery?"
0x212D072A2EBFBAE71630E431A466CD6B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0xD4C28D44A9D5383A38F339BE4B5AB0D0
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x66B2A1DA60EA8BFFD1855D31C012891D
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xB6D92D47DE376955BEE2BC8BD29AA5E3
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0xEB315F6FA1CD6E617E2B26F6137305E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x23027158E71C4BE3C43A20DE33D9F9CD
candle.
0x8EE01E15911EFB82E3B209B13934E5F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x6ACE49229A7F190C03093B7A14350BA4
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0x7C5FC5C17A6F46AF79CB670977A7626E
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x5F3C7DFB757D6B9B0A18577A8E2E1455
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0xDFEE6391D8BA2D24157F67030A51E2B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x00307E7651258B3CE7B0E22A01F393D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0xBFBFA832A7ED2E937D852CE455B6D77E
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x2AA437794B5C6EBEFDA35E5AA0695E33
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xCCE04DD7D740EC84432FD77874075D80
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x2F0E98CEEDB12091485DE54027E8EB6E
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0xC765966436F36A122C017172CED224E8
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x68E74E581EB55418231E332561669DE2
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0xA68E9D156530386AA4CE2C3D9078DD9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0x0F0DD416210B77EA2FE2983EC0FE8E46
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0xEA9A3BE86DA2F2D29F9BCB19C5D754D0
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x16B7DFDD4B58928CF724DCC027D9151B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x5766FFE326ABCFF561D2C8ABAC23F6E2
Janet now?"
0xE264447409C257BB0C569C1819D0289A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0xD112A9E514D6F739A93109F0AFD4ABE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0x0F5BE8EAECAFFC2AF41E90075BDA7B74
love and blissful union."
0x0751D626E8DAF83583BD096D3B4E33A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xC45A776810B8A146300CE71008A6380D
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0x1A8B13AF92362C0DEC82343AFBB42042
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0xBBAB5EDFD4FC8245E28A43537630D357
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x2D2FDAA38029410B0DC7444F99061695
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0xAC1C55F47BE46251AE20FB3945175C39
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x279A7CA37CFDCFFA3F5F81146B9C27A1
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x866E9AFBF64611556F4FB2ABA94D0AF9
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x66D33A4F74D1FF715E9B6C7F36BA008E
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x4E16BA522930AE11B3DBEA5B76388CB3
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0x09B029177AD00E3F9E04D94C9F7A70B9
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0xE41F7946484A0064A60A6703254BCEC9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xDDECFE2697CE3A2F8AF92934792312B5
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0x252B784BF3F35C0AFD126561E12E711A
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xEC7788E13235D51F3FA6270248B863D7
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0xF7B329D6D0559BA58037C8248848CA01
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0xD01A212D5E3DDFA8D9E5A4DC3852670A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x3E959495A217F5AE69ABA97BC6BD94B1
not taken one peep."
0x63B882DD7AD25AFC967689C009C167A9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x31A352F5F11F0B5639BA568023B84BF9
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x237AC6548FF3B7C060B576ACF3EB8F9D
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xC49587AD9CB6F8F258218F6C4226AF8D
by Mr. Rochester.
0x7125520733E0F1812042A9BD79B5C205

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0xBEFFE860FB67AA82B91C79A1484B2733
so long!"
0x72A3A1C0365E088708A6745B678A913B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x8E3A88F9D2E65D007BF34F00C0F12526
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0xB4BFA82CB12D2255C95F74D5094B5F81
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x15C32F9C509911C0143678B9A737F754
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0xFA807A05F50A74C2D627AFFFC984A062
footman, answered it.
0xB0EAC74D5E8E8309897BD50DA90285B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xA5978E1AF51D5BA0778C46E522AF5247

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0xA8CF296DB5349407D768CB54C46B9950

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x5E67D0AC588BEDFADD1BBAA383F6949A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x52077149F7A151B6D513DB5BB795A1A7
there: return and tell me."
0xD56463E00CE954186AC427991827F4E4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xB23B02762AEFF43620485C162034EEC4
footman soon returned.
0xCADD56E485927C1E0CC49E45F41A9FA9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0x4554D527D25451EA0D2A150F020EC120

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the carriage?"
0xA3EB9B55591DA6E4C9C7DCE2BD151B91

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The horses are harnessing."
0x0972AA0665E239BC534EDC06E0C322BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x9178ABA9E270539122E788CFFEDD6432
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0x5643071912D0BE1B9ABFD07C066AE86A
coachman in his seat."
0x790366EC425D264CB99342444EA72540

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x3A54B515BB60748F7C6FDD88F338B446

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x6CED045F91A0D117EDF3E2AA11F9925B
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0xD567AF1A665360141AD402DDDE007DA1
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x3FD58BDE61392E27100A925BBB2C5DFB
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0xB635B616E1F919BB6132ED30292000F1
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x60D1901ECAD2114CA004A01CB5F4A92F
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xBC2B33551FCCF3FC90F077C0B2799AE3
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0xED1EEC7AC641D6EF63DBF440D9499F6B
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0xD20DE1027E333FE4AE3517F3D7CB72C4
and flashing eyes.
0xCC1D6C33D4957F2EF567719033D6D82D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0xF0C9186FAFFBAEEA0E1F1250B1534CB5
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0x153480B4FE61B61DA87139743A4C071E
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x701452BF41BCA6ED411A0057BD26989E
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x24A34F8A184323AA0F0214FA5509030E
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x0E9EC0BFE9AE2AE25B39086A58FF63C0
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x5A9072B99CC5FCBCA68912B70CEAA4B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x08D030330E6198BBE17D2C1E0951D83A
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0xD3742062944FADD9D08976BAD00D97C2
me, Jane."
0xD730C3A3C3D8163A92EA5085EB3BB944

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0x4F8432898E9F6152655D769135FEB035
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x6EF837FE7766896404BCA2616D6AEB65
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0xB48948F5CF1246DA9544BD765E051220
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0xC81E8F7A0DED49E452AB7570836AB7F0
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0xD5B3F9DAE42FD14CB05ABDF4C1729571
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xF6BE696B4D4C74763450DB6649747F50
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x03115A417223E3853E9992ED1C4E74EF
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x93A557A569BA9A80AB05CBE64ED11381
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x872AF9E18C6A336EF4E789F9DE7DF315
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x6EE738F89F361141CD31AD11D8374EC3
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x8238ED3A072561E802BA4BBCFE823266
path to the porch.
0xB67CA48B9AEFE10A08B18324E9686505

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x7BB4BF4C56E63AF77070C69F088B4A47
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0xDFA4764B6CC6E9DAE23EB5C4F99686FB
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0xAD6568BEBC29C4C8DC2C98E9EF5652D0
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x4F27B1D666A75AD0874F1E442DF0C121
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x267641E9E0D773A6F1F93A458EC94386
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0xB71CA32011E570B15F94A8F11C2D1EC6
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x8892CA2DD3FF10CF1F107E8096FA1EDE
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x849032AF9305AC8035A3E5A61BACE76A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0xC571F6BC4B61AF8DD52C966B9BE02083
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x949D90F43980CC9694919B7ED71E5DED
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x82D56ED96AB4B031ADB4B6D9A5F5E48D
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x52FEA705093639201FC557D7DB7C86BF
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0xEFF3FD06F9878D0B2D643605FC2A2976
Rochester, went on.
0x29F791BD20515CB3300DBC6A5C13867D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x579C1A17D283D3B6ACC4457C5E7F9E63
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0xAA469BFACB2309821B695397055B79ED
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0xA3490CBE6DF9987321EB554A0708D526
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xD7DF2F2D87413DE313B88AC4C8B3C1E6
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x0F9ADC258564E6AD1FA29F10862B151D
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x4AE14C112BD978FA5EB1C2CE642B6900

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xC94E156B0DDB06DEB7A472FA952614B2
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0xD3232BF78F75114260151A8D2ED8298C
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0xF0E7D5189ED337E517EA2EF5FDBEB9E3
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x6FC4EB67834A94A50B5A253374392479
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x72B4094145A14B66A19BC817CBB69509
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x3BC2DA9001AB6DCCDD03D74E5BEED1F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0x63C37EAD0B18F7BB90FE61A061D70208

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xC86BE5ED5F9690A62E3C7B463E5B1E80
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x56C4486EDD8710F112452CD6D18B15A9
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x725CF9CE511594227FBA7E836B14A67F
said, "Proceed."
0xE691E7F187C208B2C2FDAB97153FABF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x29326DF0C138FC8CB275A4EB9C4EAA6F
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xC83EAA85324B50FE1A6E935E4EF04AFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x4186BA393ABA99A801EE28FE64DEFEBA
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x7815C5EFC7A136D0E255E09B5605A58A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0xEC317342A736AFC1245F4B0000DB825C
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0xDCFC6C250AB5BD5105A110AB08671FBD
marriage exists."
0x5FB4E536F83B5DAA83241F8BB0B07378

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x12D554F3564F6D8770742AB1D89AB7F8
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x3284E351D9B0ACA1D830AEF2AAF42DFB
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x2F85D49E65A3A15F773ADA8BE40DF38F
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0xBB406C145A1FBD82D64D6B8FAC09BFDB
beneath!
0xF6C1C5ED53F1BE4D845F32172AC3F9CB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x14DF420E6CA709F7D2D929E90C0456C0
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x656FD18EE193D52F654DEDDB9CCB40F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x6DB061C5D82B7405C82EE78444E06BA7
advisedly."
0xCC01A131B9F7AA0EB26B83F5AC673185

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x49C4B5DFFEA9EE125923A8007C084B50
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x665DF10298121960815AB696D6B46F2A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x63B0F571369032C7FA82FDFE6EB7A587
Rochester has a wife now living."
0xDE7B0C71A957754933388F54670A80AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xFA3C04FE60EC5D5ECD4E9521DBEBC771
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xFC24C378C4280E2D0626B4FED43CAE34
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0x85DF8813E7F3011FEA97108877C6916E
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0xB35A2B0D59B71539C81EA6FA43EDBE19
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xA655DC5BDCE1E9EA820E5833CD133E69
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xC6462F918EBCDB97D2EB1B34FDA677DC
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x5DBE1343D83B413A2ADBCB2361F9B65A
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0xB41241B7ABE23734479E7FB56EDFC1D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xE310551BDD4DB1587598AE9D28B70349

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x9AB7118E5FE0D8CC266CBFB698D44233

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0xC1E33AF85B74FD6C24E2E6ED584DBBBF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x9162AB41AA92CF5E8D3999ECF7865516
recognises, if you do not."
0x11A3883F6D87858EB628FA31CB423E0C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x1A1C327CFFEEA39ADEAD18C28870E06F
place of abode."
0x6F6DC7327AC8FF1D4C1F52BC81119A37

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0x6B1E252778AE074E237671F2027ACCD9
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x9DD869AE2BC13F49C1EBCF51DA87F7C9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xCBA0FC6331E0C5C5754C1CFCDEEAEEF6
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0x0DB45FB0A7795859EEA1B627C34A5FD6
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x6B774EFD6F4CCE0684390DC6959D6BC6
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,

and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
0xB4994A6431B97916A97273F537DC591E
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of

that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
0xBE2DDD98890A0E25BC5DEAF29632BAC0
Mason.'"
0x50CC4DA05B1CBB2DC6951C4ED6D174F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0xB112C37D8DC4AEB6C6752EBA8459023F
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x2AC6C57CE71AD9A03D0EC125F48A8051

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0xCFE6589743C8B61A4D3689008FA66942

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How do you know?"
0x9FD313187DE67FA56B91E7EF67ED2067

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0xAB62C517AA7FE123A3847FC399A4E637
scarcely controvert."
0x87A53FA9F0BF612D64A8BFC3593E1DEE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x79DFFF444FEDE717C5F613D82A705D34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0xE2360EA383F29FC971EE4BAD8C641D42
goodness to step forward."
0xCF33ADE05A64B1CC77451D48CE972E1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x67CE74928D96C0830374B70F4CE36B56
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0xC9A3763CE876E8B0AA620F59E2F9EC10
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x98FAEB2A226D551EC08548F2258CB7BE
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x21D2818FD6719EA09E752355FCA6B8CD
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x11603B2C7FBBF13EC920018B93634272
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xDF56CCE7F69FE0CFA184906B7F23972B
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x9E612DBF86427C65EA780FA13AB98DCB
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0xE39B1F67CEDF59EA42A3C82C550E5FCF
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0x9D10CDF788BADDF67323F96B2E4166EE
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0x79BD0957069D94F7F229038FE900351D
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x31F0E2FF4001E38A86718B8809786D71
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x7A4CE7AD3F527B1908561DE4F06079A3
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x093D1D99A45CAFD4C69A4BB93DE3B318
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xBC8490292F3A83088097C3C72F8755FA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x4DB933807DBD7F7294A898E5CC621F02

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x078BC573804D011AA61BEF493E2D0267
what have you to say?"
0x3A611FA6756E0173246EB1FC95B62D34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0xBA1D2A7A17F016DFE44066B23D73C6A8
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x3EB6E2B90843C142EA13C06DB5135901
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x8ED729C50296B4093E77F53A305E17B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0xE2B2A32630E041C9FB93E3C7CD5DF3BC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0xD8E2D9075B1998E940EB6557138A2878
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0xF502AD094C8764610D9ECEA2E4B0923E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x5B43BCCA5E973173B914D7A21F42A1B1
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0xDF4ECBB5BEDBF087FF3F763B4009D7E4
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x7C5D83839BB3FD7EC2E5783A15DADE5F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0xB5D2EB9E2041AF901793C5D948ED44F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x00CBF986C4CE0D08375F6848E335E7F4
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x235293BCFB1A3AE17D4E40AAF26C57E1
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x62DB7E379B35697A146452FDBA4D39A2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0x62A388E42FAF1E1EC161B99722F73A4A
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x9DF76BEBE182B41467CA82089337D16B
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0xFC95F57EF793270A33598D81DF354151
obeyed.
0xACE5DB7BF9936116C58164DCFA1F5561

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x69DD74A20FBA9A3121FF2D4AFC550E6E
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0xF13FB1C3EE614D6AEC94B8E98E4264CE
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0xAA22AF50270B401B8F82803387775962
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x73D75E8D55137D13E412FF085B35B233
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0x063D23E1876030B0B6937429D8D13ECE
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0xA177F86E5D38635C4D767C004BB27A59
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x6E8CDDFAA3A4D73934136025E9B164F4
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xCD1D57928338361E2800BBD807EC098C
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x3E818478AD505412B9B7622B18B462D3
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0xB225BA7DF6810F310CF9FA3A8FD02318
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x425A57AF752A0265FF1AA915C5B303BE
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xFCF8397CEA563147BC0F90FAE359A8B1
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x62644659A3667420A2A6A350D4B71884
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0xC775738A9C3AA1282D8C41ABF5FB09BC
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0xCC12F7F920368A427D22CAD152ED03CA
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x0630D04B95A428769AF9168ECFC7E52C
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x9BF3EB86D8C8C9F58D791C92F863C43D
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x555AA863924D17569E0EE79CEBC074F2
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x583029317A551E6F775A58418E865F09
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x06EF2CE0E149580AA019F7E041A4D068
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x85C4793F848E573BD0223AD8D5810AD1
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0xFE96B741C418FEB4597848F323DD06FE
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x2618846F355B97D404657C93913EB67C
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x731CAD973BF7BED488809EB6B65CE34B
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0x95A8A7B4054A2FBF5F0D07AD5E0662A7
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xA4508FA6B2F4B6A3F35BD3525FF28966
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0xCC4511AD031338A50C688FD0E8AF7011
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x26A4EC36D6E2956CDE513F0F569B8E21
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0xE67DF8D08FEC7BFC465DE5A162C50046
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0xA4D42B48BBEEB989AF1F135AB4D875E7
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x10E52208F5C78CA2B1A282410D337C03
you--follow!"
0x665FCD6D1BC592138D47C0F008BB6272

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0xB35C6E56D4DD71C3803AF45EED796DBE
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x81D2764F4DFF6A2E11B8E0E9C25AEFF9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x1EB231E96F152801E97C0A149826F562
will not be wanted to-day."
0x078FF0388D72494E3155086D8AF0D9BC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xBB0458F405AF267B1B1A83FEEAF68CED
greet us.
0x0F0B7636BBC62B90175B8BA59A67244C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x8AC3E3B983BE9E08ECEE7D0323C5DA23
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xC481E3C43A1FC9EF36457877AD4EFC3B
late!"
0xB0460D006DEE042B31C5E50FDA4F9892

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x38BCC3F24D29DBA75A1F4FCA7175A65D
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0xAC033D7CC2C0525D93E561005C6E17A6
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x9328F3BA7BDB5FD68EFF203E1F54F6E9
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xFF88B298B0267F359E9D5BCA4163CEF7
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x2E9A2BB9B6A98A681C74ABB001948743

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xD6F032CA5D6468335C9E77A74D50B078
here."
0x943AE4FBB4004F2EB019D9E502D1022E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x3B0286A95EA25EF46E4AAEDB15DF553E
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xFFFC82523E84045877048B289BAD577D
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x685B6D398132592C0104088036E960F3
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0xFDD5562984DB3A16FFCFC45F5776DBCB
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x9A31283A2DFBD0113CD6840E58C9A78C
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x235E0C853064CD531F625CC0676447BA
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x324AFC406DD9681D52D8CA9D7444ADC0
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xA5CA9A12704BE2A14290E815A270736F
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x5175B9192164D1EE18D42954D04961B0
mane, hid its head and face.
0x679B2CED9B62ACA8D4B6DAD3ADC5D8B5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x964D60DFDB252FCF9F8FDD3765051B49
your charge to-day?"
0x1C09437810EF06EB1FD9C4356C173F5C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x5D8FA74270A5A26F5860768CCA50BB61
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x8A9D2528B84BF15B087F10DDE104BE90

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x141EC47AEFA81C547AA769B05AA9E4FC
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x75D05D6584014A79ED2BACAB407F7039

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x873AD584CE31CCF93D2339826D194C97

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x2361F6D3F7EE525B4A6A9FCD18C1E732

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x4423CD7A40FC38A52808C040DB22BB5E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x70CF09A153A4759D64CD73CFC1026332
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0xD3BECBF9BACF199AEE2FF3546750A177
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0xA1DFF8AFE47558AF64FC6D8F6CBEE733

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0x5879A5E3058D532F0B9B3E307B48A3C4
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x105B38A8A8F129B3E63EFBBEF4205FCA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0xB93987436AD83BFD5FC175E144EA2DE4
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0xA9D6DA57B781ECBE46EC5155A35F1D9B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0xDA7D7B3B2F048652D8F66323079B8E36

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0xC8C0D86C847B546206243148732DC0A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0xB4B94F7647992EE984D2945869F6A4C6
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x398080F1B34962ADB6CFC5030D223276
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xFE7A4597496350EE67B5F964343DB0C6
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x2B81149C236E2FC3148417B7B42A13CA
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0xFDF3EABF9D8B8AE62E13FF63447C6468
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0x971407A6A2A381ABA1236EC960468163
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0xD4A15174C186A8F83D77993BA5C04A69
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x3241FBBD794F5AB1C4647AA451EFD280
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0xC2C207DC6DB7F666A28ED88827AC106A
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x95E08907A0394AA5D97B49187097B80D
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x2347E0C1D7DF76EF69FDC2368114FB0D
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x386552115D45B332DC9819218103B22F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x95EEB89FFA0FC5BA92155F9AB6FD472E
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xF7FA09E28E62A85F8491C6A93B304EEB
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x55185533E3B730070F1944A1EA338D74
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x386DE0B15CC94A7A1A044D55C28DA26C
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0xE8A8C8269C0CE2A0E08DD780BB43BBA9
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xCF7A79CA2A651EAEDFAE37318011FA06
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0xFEA4CE367E1341CA604A74DA982B3888
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x2829C50BC40D3AA89CDEFBF8BFB1CA90
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x776E4BD3018878B93B1886DFE5CE9005
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0xE60D67D6FDD4B8221EF723313D6285F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0x0C685BDF46E014D76EAE61E4ABF35A8D
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xFFA667C83A697FF1BA498D33D07AF82A
the stair.
0xAE604C720169D962D852E69171429166

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x30755A048F3ED5F2A5098B65C463F550
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0xA7C8A27FF87F5106F5B9531B35D2C540
returns to Madeira."
0x86692A4832A858EB5B99A9F8CAD96BFC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x4984C53E7843A037E0B167606C3152A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0x9099388B0D439F8CF28EC6132C0A62DB
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0x7BAFF5C61FBC54531AAC53348ADB1172
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x4F24CEB8D30EEBE5F37218CC09F549F6
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x940B79CC2B309FBDA976B25DA230A251
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x0005B9C08EB79EE046CAFBB7AD54E528
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x0255E9EC063C354051C78ABE23527597
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x86C4942E69E6180F198987D2AC39CA6F
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x0A20CE38AEE8C37D716E0292564DDDC9
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x77D8B593E702315381EEE8A6E6BE158F
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0x15B383B6E1B6A549E54712D2A56CF2C4
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0xF73A41D7C449C450444E86E5FD2B082F
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0xF04F87EB0B6776E7DB7DD0D159E0BEA8
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x730AA7B9F45FE1E768525CDAB438765A
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x269817F12D670619B248254200F2F8AE
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x8B2084A9B0A30CFDD7D3F1FB8329DA38
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x6903A236B1D18CE563056B94E53BA7F4
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x748ED2764F63CEAB0AED563EB6040BA3
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x6A4CF01638131DED39D882CBBE1C8F92
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0x8C59E4DC6578074D7407B214BFD2D78B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0x12A2FE0E283E7844581FED3E166CC6D1
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xA4028057D8EA8D87C291573CAAE19B4F
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xFF6EBBD4C778C47ED6755C37B5EC4561
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x093AB656F5CB782F26E0689485087F4E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x8EE0B8774D866C0FB0228F07D4D1A30B
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0xD8A51FAF888AA19D26EEEB8FE1AE846D
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x006F3DEE7B1961B5646E76188401CC3A
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xC8619942E5B194AAD82610619EF41733
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0xB1369BAA39F9D8334F49616433AE855D
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x04D882CEF4BBDE97CA048F7580D2F92E
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x0EF3C31CA9A357B3E545FBC4CAF1CB80
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0xBBE35B877ECE7BCD3B05EDFAFB120977
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xE7784F6D7B7AD2200CCBFCDD777B3A97
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xC2B248884C7EA385AE3DD61179E0C9E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x52E3563A6222DE0DFC53FDEFB491EE21
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x9716F846753C637E51973877E44806ED
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0x64AF4821988CD8981DACE8FE2496C4E7
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x84139D1AE6E50B5576724FE61ED80DFA
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x83776899853E4A3F0E8C7306F1D0A8EA
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xF531603305B852D82C0A99A6EF9AB694
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x0539B8E2E965D8A80AC57F46E3AB5959
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x325E93214DF4AB1741F94B3264171DB7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x73FFF46A872D38384CA07D6003EDDDB2
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x2DB40236E25E3F2AFF73FF127610867D
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0x458572C93C914B92D5B9B8DE3640B9E8
prospects?
0x00B41B417ACF1A07F79B5AE9AC2EC363

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0xF733802EC0BA49427CF8C9C542FF4B06
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x4B9B3263D81BC47C5142CDC88A2B93D4
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0xF21DAEDA49017EB3316FBEA02974059F
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x8A3E6EBA6C3257DAE8795DF476E58117
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x31BDF1F4D0C5D279EB4F0861C18AD419
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x68AF11278D376A1F5D7D870E6C5A4B2D
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xA8A64CD281A80C0173FD99C295795752
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xD6EC96AFE2CD0C6D64A85C752EB6CAE4
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0xCDAFED00C2CC06383F9964204A0D2789
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x779650AC576EE8723EE8A0B74696C80A
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x2AC081E624D92C20FD50EE652ED2306E
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x1BD0B88CDA2AD1BCF42E913A235EA68D
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xA2DFDB14FFE514A84CA2A9E2E656BAD7
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0xE32AB5FBF96C3297ED8032E41CB0D02F
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x70B43ADC16BC47CE04C744B93801D258
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x6AE6CED3F6D0651241BF8999FEA67B8B
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x886FB85C643DDDDB48B73C889FB30537
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0x40B20B39471E3FCF845C6299B4089BE3
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0xDAF6C8BFC379A0D6B03047C1E3C81564
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x800EEBDDB2E72F4DB69B2656CD59A5DD
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x91D16D548A7829AF4B7E3CF2D906A7F2
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0xF5FDE945143A007641C0781A7785E54F
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x5D5640A07B4DFFCBAC73E2AB66B653D7
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xA7898C0479A1CABFDF5AEC9F83A363ED
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x7D1A4CBF842895D7CB1E24746707AE93
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x6852830671284403DB55AF212B94C461
conduct!
0x87BE35EFDF77A2F83CAE05659795E88B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x535A8786F9A3EE9E49A48619415380B3
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x3E5776AF1E4614CDAFDDA002C0EB827F
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0xC4E0A35EEE3C8F95230B4B8A2A945663
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0xC082147960B1668229B582861BAE8DBC
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0xE161C151115DC28806EA5F569BF4D073
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0x5EECBE10B410E470935B844BF95126C0
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0xE77E50818C3C523107A6C50A33C5BA86
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xD389EE1A344F044E1A681E1A8CBB18FA
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x806C2EABBCB1C2362E2C120E7C9AB19D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x687BB6E38E686C988E923992523A36F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0xA4C38DC7BC64C28097DE5BA40347E658
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x328F92B19906DB528A8C105372B78982
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x1BCF8D9314EF737DF0980BD79F145F0E
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x3C4D6B2B7A7AEF439756799A08744657
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0x037E84C3E1C7965133403D2DCA60F622
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x0EF57632711BFD8DA5ECCA1D1186BD7B
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x9F2EC8F60274EBCA663F2125056E3A9C
floods overflowed me."
0x04C6E9280CA489056CD06370928ABCBE

CHAPTER XXVII
0xF3E6A999BF35879650CADB2B8065AAE2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x2C82083F354FDACCB42BCDE165D5C0DD
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x2C2A574555A24396B69129D2F37C88E4
"What am I to do?"
0x7A3414097A707C8E5E9CF2CF14985DA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0x9B6EDFF709BD0ADE90DF4A2B8B267D79
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0xBAEC9FE7B8EFDCE33E664E01574310B7
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x0885159A7E96E64EBC56D6A270EB77DB
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x06ED064AF461D19D574D40BB40A916C7
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x39FB7DEF4A25ED8D6A544B7E861A51A3
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xAD8476879890A688198162FF34D4E23E
cannot do it."
0x4773068B70F9C7420E838CD9A4E2B0DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x8F0E322785F01A312269A9D6AC4EAC04
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x6B07412307E28E59FAA65F5F97CBB8B7
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xCCCFA2276127EE7E45D62091E54AFDC7
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0xF38E1C140E0BEA5CF6A7573814CA00A8
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0xCFCD5F8158CB6EB6F6D52C57410C8B94
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x62A2C92E6BB2E7812E41429B38FD2EE2
depths of agony.
0x0EA0480B8DA07F3DBCF3BCB88DD94E0C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x2CCF98A963DFA9D199F74E050202F51A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x41A86619362742B0BBCEDDFB16364DFF
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x11A0E0571B523EA20B5B37EA57AD3E9A
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x71E12623BD8D18FB9B3BEB1F337847CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x01AF92AA3BC8E564EAA96F133F1F1183
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x045D0FFE6662A5AC2B69C47D95AB914D
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xD1F3AE9B69EB15F34FD20C8E36B231D4
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0xDEE6D5C12F4C758464DA0EC869A2F02E
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0xD7A71E234EC654795E75285675D085A7
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x662B95A53713F784FF593BF5FCD5ADC9
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0x40119EEE527D4D88D69140699C846660
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x0220D3B00B2DFF83AB3DE6E85129FC37
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0xC5AD707CA447B8466C7007CE77160BAA
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x478C40BD5556520D2341D11082ADCD2D
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x81514494C1E48F1E24389034F224F838
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0x36D66A307D942DF6F1D27F19FBD386C8
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xCA26D67D16EC15346B8CB472E06146DB
threshold.
0x85F3FBDF7DC701A53F00202FA2C3C420

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x49B98B596EF121CD7CD2AD92D8E8B551
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xCF62D9894EB90C5D1FA0940B299718F3
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0x6C3E235A9D18DAED934B2608C7006AD2
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xD64237C2F75B28908303F9DC2704ACB4
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x348330F83CFA610F7C79028F4E27FC90
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x2E3E93687221241A5A4369B1D0B1D295
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xAC69155AC83F38081354BE13C6ED1953
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x662968701DDCF9995E0346313BE37D69
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x620957644FA3B561B8030B25AB0BAFC1
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x69A789E1FDCDFF2F02506472D3F14BBC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0xD910A191856831E910A4D1594361AF8D
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x406B7B7255F71AF34E09536F1E29E157
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x21A0F7E1F9742CF6EDF55EF3D7B06387

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0xBBF0CE4711F70E87FC8861E82384198D
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x17FDFD05F886733E0833ECF19F19EB1D
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x6093853C3ABEA7070122743791071648
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xFF25EE3B27D5A2C41CF264A64C5E3775
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x8B39945EFE49DCBDF5DAD23016CF5F91

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x24B6D5C3AB7335CB9CA0DB8639E28318
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x146E67A0D27DC96BAD8D4E6BEEED5233
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x72DB77CD5F7E11F558472E629BB7CA4D
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0x5C2B41ECD5CA458AAF2DCEA666DB208A
heart's core.
0xDF2FDD8E07695D22D8FAEEEA3080FB38

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x5BDF8AC6BB010564C743F9E1CF5C4ED2
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x666E16D87829C187964D608C8E311B8E
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x073BCE78C11D78D2769A6439A3FA44F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, sir."
0xD49C1946017DDE3D137A51D60A1E8B59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xB0A9418C05984489B95052329414FB8B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xF873F39045037F9FFDB811A5C4EBC872
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x20B922899297FA10088EF0577BDE6E66
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0xCD3E957099BF0C50F89490AB33F1B1E6
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0xA5D2655321C883DC422D71DC6109D6D1
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0xBFFBF48D0A5873476A626876C6DFD4B2
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x5655C16112670B9BA4A6FC72A2614696
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x32EF5ECB72CE74989202C058C9ACAB42
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x7351D34883BBA11BB5D32A7B23B1F3CB
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0xDDE02B12FDC3614C76204F937612E564
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x919F8DBF318F76D08EA415ECF89F0820
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0x819D0FA11B417BE8163E098CEC85C941
him."
0xD95C162D0EB0B7F2568D20F18251B75F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x75555537553319E001CBC52979B6CA0A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0xBCBEE539F3ED99EE316E0A20529D106F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0xC3639E5D564F9C4BB32F8382FD7C9A23

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x7A056E17AF5622D466C8553C0686AF6A
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xDFB42FD227A6C36C8C6586A3D93FD6C2
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xBDFF9CA93935EF75B7D54BE39243E1FB
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x6C0AFCE9FE27D8AC70F6CDF03AF2D8B2
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0x04B26B7E795A08BDD660101AEF6A7B5E
put his aside.
0xBA50810A2B0785B64658D76C158A2EE1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x912434D0C7740CD801CBEC0E0673BDE3
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x74B18ECE4217620622A38F9F9B1F2537
appropriated?"
0x2472D01BA2E69DA9BDD3827196BC5DEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x8DCA3FC273D00BD377F23FC10626E60C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x56F513A6655E17A52C797A2E8460B056
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x818834C54759B4458EF9A175C665DBBF
rightly?"
0xF6818A8C9583B1828BD4E3216750059D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0xC3C8A76079E3441F27612685B4E1CAB4
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x877E52324AC96E8EE4B20D28D64ACA08
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0x5485A9FBBD3A6160D01B3EC843CB97F0
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0xF8FCD816A777A1227938E001C3527979
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x53D9310E6B98E3665FB7CB9B1F1523F3
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x2B701A74BD78C7EEE04EE27F841B17A1
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x09F31A9AAB1917A44EAABA34B9A3B7E6
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x5EE9076E5E5C24F389189568DD3B8ADB
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x277F1C9F7E982EB6D5005025B78F8A90
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x0F341E289B94D8033BBF0C0AF38AB427
know you--I am on my guard."
0xB2DB44035A0F94E37A64B745D840580A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0xB979B6A96F8DE9177174E6CC4CCA76BC
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x2CD320E9F5D8AEED8D2922D714FC835E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x9D357196463F3493B8920D376FD722AA
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xF255636EAA45B498E95B48CBDB97C798
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x9A61BDDDBC49CF435610DF8A8BF9C8AD
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0xEE6F7FA4649C57E6427899E87EA7916E
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0xA0A3658B35E1E85C642F1D8FA200BC22
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x038EA097F50F43676D99802288282D75
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x722E86199D125BD3E51DBE7E6B763728
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x8A7AC3C51F467C11CFD074B95BC18A41
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x0D6725A26FE1819685A800D1A10F38C8
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0xA49848CA8C41F4B3D814EC35C059C33D
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x1C10ECBF66D7F9ADD05C3E3B07C8F550

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0xB3D020CFEB0D81EFBFD88AFC94FF4BAE
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x1B2E51430AB13048B0D1F1F13746F007
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x463D4FDDB16BEF5DBAD85C453CAE4C83
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xE42D31DCAE08003716DC0527E0E51571
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xBF16DF9D3973CD45D985F5C18332708E
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0x8BFFA2FE115618D756A47D806451C67A
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x2365B226F3EE8E4B9D3CA73865D758A3
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x872B358D33C276AAE4CC7CABA95E3080
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xCA49FA38D4E9B75E57E0E6F18A8A8911
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xE1A7FAEE5900905728B5E154D397C180
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xA2493CA9DD3F450407AA85A537753FE1
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x95C9B0ED9FC1362AC71ADAE4232AE216
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x0C2056E36EC185403CA256B4F2363545
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x9F341097862896A111C50C39B88D12C1
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x93DA690DCB3D1B55E1F1C36394CD5CEB
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0x31E2B7994C2A2E99AAA6D136FB43637C
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x4F9A3E03F8C8C978BC8476C8BF201DC5
assassination, even of what I most hate.

"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x41D13A70DCC0A412C22C4EF1C1590481
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0xCDE3F836DF1D602488DBA34E5E463CB2
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x24FDAD9759E1DB52AE62F4CF40D65E07
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower

she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her

is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to

stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0x2BED62DCEE8E18102600BDE1A110319A
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0x7BDE97A2F2363AA985B212C04FA1784F
cannot help being mad."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0xCCBC6508E1473E160502E66B67957563
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x398F41F914028481000B6B281F41BA85
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0x26BC046069836217CD987FE8DD1B62D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do indeed, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xD3F9DD8652B5AF00B65E033241994526
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x6DC3D2F9F5693CAF16720DE9DC6B7DB5
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x0E8F7A714736B816B404690A8EA6103F
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0xA0A26EE51A09D903EF36A3A02772ABA1
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0x91C9EE497BC29F14F1FA78FAD7FB21DB
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0xE31CA36BE960D4B8CA6951274B260B40
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xF7635D769B8D07E2FAEB6BDB22DE6371
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xF9CF8EB116A9837AE5ACB81BD3593B3B
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x91436AA3714A0C31868537DF71A2CC0B
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x1E273B9A70491A4474DC04CAC1F1D02A
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x393C746B824E22F7B32D0EC3BD73830C
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x59B09644EF32EE6513F72F3364EC10A4
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x5B0F3347D414E413BC8E9B8384E25B96
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0xD9D8B60094EE89342646634BB13CC05D
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x7DED40517F06B6DDE2FBCC7CAC046F83
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xC7D2949A0BA1211E931FB4FE969480E3
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x5D18F5D5FD5361B7A334B310F6256B00
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0xC2E6045AF532E69CD015A0CB8F736DC6
falsehood and slander."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xF10DC67879500D297A6B87D3FF07E5DB
for you."
0x7A518808DC51169CAC89B8022A16B1D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x10336B38496045ED640C4AFE649830F9
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0xFFB9F8E87C8A230C643F4537F4838384
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xDF627B0027425D4E546E19A29AADD37B
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xC2C73839DBDF2097477207B75C16476C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x5CA4B7CD6E8D1F86325BBFA4EE1252A0
too dull for you."
0x8BBE968DA90E08615B8248891FE4FBFD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xF7C25248BA3B4CE9A9B27D7EC640E6D4
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x4B3B11727CC533E257594B74F682772D
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xE805A4875ABAA92F3360678476F6BB72

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0xEE22BE7FD101117C5A58A7F92D88BE96
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xEA12E14ABC796BDD269922A66F060BC4
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0x866C4ED327D5BF06573C0E4BC9FC78EB
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0x5E0ECB8DB045BC16D8FFD8FB66882094
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xC49A1D0597F48C4D71DBEC70C8CA04C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x14F4166E0AB405C140976B626D832682
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x7D2C100E82CC73F3DE112C6058332B9C
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x7EA124C459F854936C98404194705BD4
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0x743A8A95BE735D57148CFCD9F502A8D0
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x2FCB2EB9AFB21A5AEB501E8CEEDC2DFE
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xFED7319C7C65FEDEEED9AE8BD3A79F01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0xBF22F4744C73B417E21A63F66EBB2E60
before me.
0xE9B100F05377FDA2F8578621694D1202

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0x5CD0E67B238B6ACDD60D06E4B37CE73B
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0xBDE9EF1FDC820AA22E2FD676F063843E
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x8272079330CB8B380EA7A919324D018E
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x690A846235EEE12C5E2A2DB8AA9D445C
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x62389205ED30D31C6A84A6964CFE1C1E
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x4BCC5F495E0B26D2F4DA41F79E6CFC00
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xDF3E3534BA1D6C5F71248E1E6EA24F5E
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0x9442625E48D9BD5405D4CC9DB85CECDD
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xE9A13A03D1E694B6104ED9194381680D
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x476663DF929EBF7B2CED87BD45A7870D
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x70F3C197B3D2F0993F6E5DE546AF2F0C
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0xE7D8E396EBDBCEA0A474FCF5C7DD5023
soothingly--
0xFD86E6BB0BA19A10B73E551F31BDF432

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x292A4F1FEA41F8E7B1EE0FFB874D8D12
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0xF5AF4483007C302EFE15ABEF64006851

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0xC2CCB703E26ACB67FCB6E51EA925A489
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0xF33370926F6ED8273CB13E48931E4831
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0xD81144A7FA6392FA0FAC1E53C4129C68
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x8E9994FA95A41E546F184CC7B32AE73D
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0x275744F061598A11E1C959C85968DD1B
heartily.
0x7B562DC6BF53B71CAC397E2942FA5794

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0xA1E8648F141CC7C072CE42D805FCAE50
not while he was in such a passion.
0x162C8C9DECE8179AEA491984589905AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x45798C291E640941F5473EC53781514A
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x181ACFE66A61961F9D2287A0DC48C351
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x8B6427DE07F8D699D0AC2CEE57803F92

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x3FCD0E6F41CD203DCBF88CBDFF6EDE87
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xE961C3CA1B44B1D5BE1253FEF750FB6F
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x82950F8239C3B61A38724BBD5B2ADB1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0x2C5D1D387BDC6F1518CDF6F1A83C741F
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x1D945D1CC9765E7B134E3A4B9E17C6C2
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x1FD44B098AFF67A1F3246DECA42C3261
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x3BBDB206DA775B0816F691E587FB80E5
were some toad or ape."
0x3F487660A2CE22DEDD9731E89F05A41D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x66A1CB0BE4B5E008E9951550379BC75F
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0xBA564AEBB34B4CE1C1579713EB4690AA
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x98CBD46D4B503E586363FA43CE512E5E
where I had wounded.
0x60487269E63D47D533FAAE09C7C87852

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0xE8889C04DB84D69895D500E197180965
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x9BE9FAC8D6507E2BFBD539E7D1BF017E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x77203E220039B48174C776003D21DA3C
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"

innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make

To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to

you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the

"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0xE8F6328C1C31BA5880AA9B839BD22694
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xECD442DC4A9D6AF02AF626784A283177
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x1BE79C41B4F1824E751F341DA7BE8D86
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x1077D3C8D253D9A3FA514D39669A8F8B
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x88439AAACA64C23CDECE099E743CB19B
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0xF5DE1E43DCFD2A13567257CC93A8C944
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x5B9EE6353E248AFA322C9C87577A0DAD
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0xDF5008E45E980077183DEF296BE5646A
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0xD0D5AA54908160F343B34EB8F2FB74A1
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xA1A58149CA5D40F2B8DCD6E77388F039
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0xD12A188C34ACB207BC3DDF600A7F047E
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0x6CA94FD6E65C513E5443FCC3F5936FF9
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0xBDF8C569BE47F0B5E5F95EDA284BAC9B
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x880A31CC31DC5C8D8FA5F0F117225297
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0xA7A1EB5D94614B598D72285353EF493A
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xAD9DE68C28F212A801E3262758FFDBAF
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0xD950331670922E74CEF91DBD89688518
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xA84797F9E2918A10FF8CA0D3FFE52D39
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x2F527B97195D2D4D958D684E4ED3AC90
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x211884D23EBEE4F0B5DDF4AEFD4A6947
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x278D0D23BD62B9078904CA479A2B81DF
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x294896D6DBA550AAC43E539D170B3AE7
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xE2E2655E0E5CBB2A3273D955DB4746BE
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xBB01D3B7E8DCF13D0E7BF6E7ACD7AB56
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0xC65D8E05990120C1E2F34D2BA501DE7D
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x34B9D98FB75FE0536DE89947DF54F6EE
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0xF9A2CD5A40D9C553FA05870AC69788C3
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x8BBDE81B56A88DAAF1C94134B084A8D7
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x4AD646A814C050E94BE548D5EFF01AB0
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0xD95B0FE4E49BFD5990FA61805930C381
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x116B602CAE454D72507992FF0DB793A0
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."

The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor

all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble

and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x62A752C846D69BACF103C10C5F1C5C01
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x42A9B83C3BA7F8907F9BA899FCE96A71
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x72B9A884BDFE860E7ACC4E1BAB9EA53A

0x872325E4F8D0201B93182BD049F5AB98
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x83A4445A24CB0AA3BBBDC841D13FA588

and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0xB06F93CAE6E283D04F657FF56D40FD69

propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on

which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0x51C871B96C460A8AA05B918CF96379E6
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is

all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I

I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0xD2C7980D7ACC5607B6ED329FED34C602
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xB8474EEFC9BFAF73DD74699BC1C2A8E6
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x89D3589337767BDDD87F11920C72C7C7
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x5557EE33BEC0548B4F559FE4BA263AC8
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x45589B0F2885C20E0E04D152A0B77B13
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0xF3D75047C08183C8C438AB9626BE0CAA
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0x283AA3D03CD3F4CD4AB3CB0226E59631
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xA35218D0E89200814C7C76A9824FEE03
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0xBC8C7C37D61FCB178330B1DA8E9B4611
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0xE6B52112FA10B33F3202703ADEEEF0A6
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0x5177B88062F32B61AB221BD7F2DF1293
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x141A54C398A1BC07BB11E1420E71477A
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xADC95080C51403EDB7CBB653CE69A58D
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x92AC0442D2A7FFE963F3262F5FFE0BA7
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0xE94AFDD106CCDF932EE1EB83C76219D6
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x77DFF2E91CEB33620A4BED0422A4B56F
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0x0E3157EB7C5D9C9DEC8C4BB09021CDA7
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xEF571AFC2E6664CE21EB3FEADF164816
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x68C06A1438B3581BBD9558B57C397829
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the

heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity

the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of

exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design

"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not

made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0xDB29CED8A5304CF1ED2571675ADAC712
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x8117404C79167CEE17093658F3813FA9
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0x5DFEC70096F6E603D7516F05327A173E
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x28F10CA3EC8421E76C73CA9A39BD8294
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x4516AC671551C29967E2734C20A81134
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x3EBA435923B19A9D35F52296E0E51CD4
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0xEA86632536B0D23095BA7E49C5DBC2B1
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.

"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0x65378C73C1B4F1FD3D38367536BAC2AB
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xFBBED23DCE2083E6D117761389292EB0
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0xACF0AC2FAC22566537F262D64D3F7FC1
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0x39B0A7FADD089792928488DCEA494532
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0xAE5CA6CFDD9FE72290328831A6797785
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x872C1B30CB13E4EB8A6D15EB51E61132
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x4F82DFD86F4675D9ADCFF62E92B36A98
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.

At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the

surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xAEB6BF25F3E91DBBAA6F87F307E0F404
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x8AAD3C3F8023844F3470DC8FE809F2BF
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0x4720B7469C315D9AC3D1D1FBE4DAEF7A
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x15897A2AE19CC5216A72125236DEE595
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x8E6642ECDD86856541DE36D72E7E07C4
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x0BD6957EC8A9CA34A9EDE3D2518C283D
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x3B0A6E5E82D252C14BE38A5F6BBBF592
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x161F2CEE3D63ECB4C7C391A86BF5F5EA
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0xD5C4EBE694EEA0835A6177E629A86B61
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x7678FE9099D99C1E496E6E2493AC4B46
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x1A047FD2A2CC53CB1A8640C658346228
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x7C6966B6B773465575CBFB006E19E99A
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x7D2DE9682D868ADE4DD9E5FD0B360AC9
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0xE0E4820FB6765662338B99D9746E7562
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0x014F285D9CFB48471BA48F5F0EB5648A
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the

thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet

Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0xD9DB55AACC3CD547E2E0907572445335

0x99DE2F18163651A707DD7A0C338CDB2A
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent

my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to

so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be

For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0xDD1FF387060B9B85C249994E0AB69782
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x152734EFF8630E679341DE43CA2CF8D4
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x124314053C08746441AC1880A6AC19F9
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x79CB4DFE5B280B744BC7FD78D333127F
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x7BC6AD4522C4787F29F36FEA5403E89D
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0xB70AA3503661308242356BE16136C7FB
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0xF952570737834C07EDEBE944342F47C6
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x0FE27E8F18CC7D15946F5626451C3B57
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x0E6BED7A9F12728E4B09B19417459E37
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x1B7B4427DCC59B292DD0488746F85D19
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0xE5CDC150251D3B6AC7E78B2BA9C546D3
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x967A13C5FCD4C7B633B4768E9D570F27
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x06155F332EFCEFA8D6748696F7896411
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xCF2EAE330396F0149891CAA15AA8CEEA
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0xB85DC4F48B8DE3EEBF5FBE623D836C19
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xE21306F024EB30500C5B7C012BC909C3
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x11F1FD34362531DD6D77B6595CDD6146

0x8029B9EE174F4D80F40416AA85C26DE7
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0xDD532887792A7AFCF5365E358DE696E2
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0xF6F1778DDD7216BCCBC0E2838FFF4169
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x41E7F685C2F96C65960C70C0721D37C9
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0xCA478AEDA414FB1D39C7DA622FDA63EA
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x6DF94DE64BA5026A9C34224D06C07F73
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x40BC36A4641A0C0AC9AD797325D06D14

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x5E2D13B7FE6E0E045CBD8D4D48B617D2
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x84EFA40A429FB08953193AE3E6C7A1DA
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xCA248325B863E9A3EA85F848A5634A6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x2D66BC176669843D08B3F04894D6F335
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0xA8799ADA51486FEC5D1439906CC7CCAC
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xDF4829E4DB09D09E2A3DAE4627D93AAD
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0xD90A8E5C471CEC589E6FF472576E8E21
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x3C7F09B73560BC32F541396D9DF6CC29
Giacinta, and Clara."
0xF133C003044BA26626F47A8C244BCE7F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0xB6092454AD5FBFD5A6E22C1E5903F63F
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x997CAEB4A9F2D9FEC1FAAA0651218825
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0xA090712578572DCA97400C4CB3955C37
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x4F4AE9343874ACA17E090731356F348A
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xA76064F0C6249D31F8191F6BF8CE0460
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xD3C2C65116B8692A6AD3A916BD76824F
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0xF7D33C0EDCB7DF4C458504FD79B1E874
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.

"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0xE7EE8940C4732B59CAB6B5EE5BF9E37E
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x86621CAF60B4EAB1C00A530E2E82A288
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0xCB7FA6FCCB59B0C9725F5FF41127178E
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x267790923C66FECFF12B7AB0AAE02B5A
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x3795084B40EC30D58D395AD9A6F1F086
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x8AA18C5A9B9173564F340032FF59354E
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x77D297FCC347A4C83C317FBBD5D5E131
back to England.
0x49CB43E797E7B4E50B9A8155FE4F3611

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x2895C0828516F5BBA5FE8CC9CC025E21
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xBBE9D10650AEA829B53E3AFB9E5E2574
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0x82B6FED1D66A5FFB329736C9119F1B6C
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x34A9862BC503D9653659B951A4377E0A
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0xD92BCCBDEAD6332F7934F060F877AC2F
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x0B3BC4EA2EDD9D1C185287750846B48F
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x7F56F5778536AB7E222C40BD3A0CB3D4
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x3AA6FEA3B4442562DACF2A39E986AD87
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0xF78B8BEC298910723542A0F1B53680C6
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0x10EB18E07885184BA69249A64C6F85EA
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0x357FF9B143462FC6F3BBBD2F6BBB1DD5
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x60DAB1B7A6DE7F54CA6321DDE7238665

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x129F4F090F6373847456953A6986549D
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xBE6B5F22D1FE3F93423DB3DD15F98611
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xC9CD1A62E69A1B504C148064303C3145
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x0FC008C2F2455577362F6D275C0A223B
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x7B20052CA99CDAEDCDCA164FA117E853
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x86EA8477B02B28A105C014C5BEDC2C47
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0xA77CB9EEBC61B8924E8B0E90ED4351CA
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xC688858AE321ED8B386F4E6F0B40E94D
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x4C606625EE66749CA035CDD756D6E289
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x48F166D5DEDC87E9A4AEB953656B6F73
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x135EDA032B9C3D4AB2A06C0CB4577993
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0xDE3585C011A014EF9436849FC0B856A6
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x18D8FE21EAEB75B5BAB73B9E2760C620
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x9BAF8D8BFBFB57F80EE8217864C49775
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x0967F31DCE987525BAC5A2A9B4296379
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xEE12C10B77B482B4ED7CA4457C3D4DB9
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xC16B69D6528A919F6BE54B5F0B1C46F9
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0xB752BA639A5283A07165115103A9ECE5
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x77ABE2DD7552DE14A5FAEF015D35698F
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x7B6CF9221A07A4A133DA0D264DFFF437
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x6550D1C58E3111D1633CA91BAEF5CEE5
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xD0E03D8258423EF3D1239C38760A8EB1
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x887BF4C1583DB68208143DB5E3DD2570
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x17236C5E87A6F13B729ED253FBFFFEF9
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0xEE0877002380B6B099CA99B2B8607AE4
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x7661CDC383EA7BC930D3CDA21E299658
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0xCE56A75D387F0AD0EBD0CB51392E7A01
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0xA13A1C9DDA1D6D3A39C84AE94F23B368
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0xBF01A182B57B6C834B532678B9052F3F
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x7713A731DA9E4CDEC016F11ACC2D1823
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xEE2D21083440838E5DAB8C2F7FD22711
out of my sight.
0x28760E364425FB1583E026831A1E4A21

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0x9FECF330949AB4685E51348015C4F732
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x4EF38795B15E935085CCEA9CCD598B00
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0x108A94D29A4FBF44C82B122523396B2C
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x50005A4BDCB2751BC94CC3DCC709C578
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x8D7111D83D67CA5A55B5C546F5074F1F
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x8FDD12A18A77A381A610221524656ACB
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0xB894311143BDF5743224E1256BD0960D
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0xF83FDEBD67CF9A8232EEE7E5F80A0E94
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x9E7C9588EB1C78650BECA7AF4F952CC9
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x7EF2883BF3307C51CEC57B411BBEB64C
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0xB70513C4A3016DE2F9386D259438CF46
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xF1D8BA3B661DFEE20101A5A6050E0A78
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x82FC5C18B86B1BCA4C7A8A504B6F2B5E
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x4C424D46AAA5503666E484D58E962594
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0x82AA63250077835F462749B5509DAB20
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xCB13BC8717C461BDBE7BCA741614A3E7
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0xE070744FC39E0050BE538A5BF3502E22
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x35855DB631058412797A2320BB8163A1
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x5222B66549BEDEAD6AF6B168383920CE
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x88966E0DEB4E52DE3576FAD80AA01E4E
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0xDF028D6C58644855ABBBA8E5E10EB621
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x30DC3DCDEDBFEACEFB4D03ED0ED9F6A0
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0x16755EA255182889C76CA5A42A959C52
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xEC49584FD4ACF15002A33B5788BFBEC8
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x34DD934E1DF87AA8229954EA39BD7948
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x5D1454561D224709839FBFF35BD9547C
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0xB4CD22157C1D9EDD76AA3FE68C923CF9
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x7FD779C249C5E673A8C3605F07EF9ABA
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0xBF0E2DBDB37C116D9975326A1296DC9F
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0xB744126AE2379A0FF69C82A5FCE7CE4C
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xCECAD693C69BE79981E5579D96C110E7
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x1DC7C16FB438945C18520971749CCA6C
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xF45E53283B2C3B8A9089E544DDE0FA73
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0xED355B84C74F9CBAEB3DD915648F32A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x564BDFA563DCE01D0B925AA3341A737A
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x032FB5780C5BAE2DB981266E3D0A9B2F
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0xC3C84FC20FE8F2CEC1954F3CBD5999B3
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0xA59548CFB07BA03E46808AA7DB93471B
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0xBD8EED8985EA857E366BD8F7A78896EC
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x745AF3E467983B2197D3A301C34F29D7
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xBBFEB52FFD606734EBCD975CE51F6DF3
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x7A017DABF6F3C509E621788D0FC003C8
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x7D01D457A1E44773733829C720AA08B6
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0xFD3599E16FE3E4BB5E26F23E8B38D884
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x092954F11EAD16E34FB78A9B4EE7FC57
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0xC3F420BA67A130A3BDF3E2265DB0007E
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x2A5FCF12016E53C5E4360C806ECF9110
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0xB43713BFB8B5D503F6541FB218E7D3F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x9375A7DA301657EE8C7C5C08BF3664CC
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xBBA1D93C262DF832819FF3FFC8AE2C92
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0xEBD874DE2719EBA08C7B65035CCE28DD
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0xC83731A43AAB7CF6DD38F040B46ADDC0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x027B6167E552185B8A7FBC33D3E3FE28
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x71E0859B98BC18C8D782BA989E41E632

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x3D95FE760A98E635C8E304C6F4940B85
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x706F0E4990ED837B47EBF11911726609
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x106D3DB338576C4279E34E175F4127E8
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x7E270315DC07D87CE94DB4B7DA656B46
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x0E70192D1C925CA77B975F652D2DA017
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xC04EB9FF12F666D7471D0EFC6CB4607F
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x78FA542C0E1590918754AB609DD91E4E
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0x772AA1565627D5CECEA42DCFAB363376
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x376A7481F85F201E24AC6E0C2A19BAF7
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0xFDED0F481974482987E918F4C5F0D286
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x232AC93F4A3A5C88F95223E8674BF503
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x4EDB626D3AA548341633C2BBC66274F9
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0xC424F317B2F756A4BDF238BB70B7FE98
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x7C0C16E55966D3F834F3F343811BB456
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x36EDCDE2A1B22D9AA6A578B955A8CD57
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x1AA697729F9D6A752CFFCA492A41A70A
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0xF07FC61D29F4E86176B9D776EF030581
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x682338A82820B9F10551FCD8C82252A1
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x91AA34873FAFF05057FC182FBB34F6CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A pause.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why are you silent, Jane?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x5F1644BF3D13DAA1DA15A7AF45E564DE
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xF0CB10A1CA271FA78D91C083EA553598
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x97550C9A107B775F3EC833E6EE8D501E
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x5EA1DE3B421E94E8EFB568DB83C3E6E7
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x1C0A41A65CB0503DC570C29431614342

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x6D33017A8ABB31945E9B14C524A6D837
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x0D023DBD2CB307829F898ECBC1E82DF1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Another long silence.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xE2694F0039829B0EA95DFDA36A8C6E6A
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0xFD7D158C0C2681E0A2679ECBBA3AA1E4
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x19E6316664AEEC8DCFB671EB214BB5D5
and to let me go another?"
0xAF5B5F0E3507A362075355B0F4321C62

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0xC49682E843CADE2AFA41FA441C160DD9
to love me."
0x86957B906A484F5E244BD2CD2AC03ED4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x7E7D4DFA1F52386CBA7CECEFA9D58FAD
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x528AF7D9C4409DE5195BCA1587B804D4
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x1614E66A235A75A3FDEBF075A7D96255

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xB6AD2B4CF09DDB032F434B8AE2108A84
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0xBE95C50633A73A6121249BA87DAA0F88
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x729BBE23BD26984F64D1079E9C48D4E5
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xF750C8DB25818E402FCBFF9C4D6BF09A
companion and for some hope?"
0x5A62B47751C7AD67AB191CE619313484

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

again there."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No."
0xCE36EF61FB1B0510BC0DAC4717647CEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0xEBB78EE8BB65C7A1BD5B6B664C9F51A7
rose.
0x1386A9B7B6BC83EAC552A2BB6DF38A3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x20B4B0E5A1BCDCA7A37940FC23748C9A
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x4B5008BC62022B291D491CF13409B61E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x56FD8BE24708FF877F04616DF594144D
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x947E1255F4B22FCAF38A014D88FA4325
will forget me before I forget you."
0x7B7982B702E4E759EFF1FADFFC74A3BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x9C9570E838070018BB2E98880853DEB1
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x765ABDB430A9B7660E79DDCE765D3F68
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x1A1E3234160F7AF8E2BD1F19EEA29789
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x56D1D8856A1934A0B2B13F6743692B00
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x6D99CB483C318C6B83A3F19BBB6EA5F2
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xA37DE1504E5AEB398BA502B291C188E3
by living with me?"
0x1A4585DC1E626DF9E941A556BA89BE01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xF9AAC7FB0C3027574DE6F579817B7AA6
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xBC4EE235CBB2323116946563FF675CF0
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x2283B591F67F443257AAFF91E201FD27
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x5C8C7A3665B7B52F26089624FBF1759D
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0xF889BD9EBAB4C6FCBEB60BA9459A17A9
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x237BBF864F576742E12530393F196D6E
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x54AB9D218CBD5B0DABCFE5D567D0AC95
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x60FF7BF2B442F85845B0F1074FA23CEB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x8690902F3A64D5A63617B3009FC496C0
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0xBE713E7D97C0FF88E6BE54A513DCF905
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0xB5B3C7F0C45B640E9542C1C49A4D2650
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x983E5254A500B275DCEE20365CFE3B9D
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x0F4D28D7C230FDD915D1FB920E3D4E37
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0xF5BEE879C0959A6C3A3877D0A821C5BC
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x0074A9779E8397D37AD5F55416677B19
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xFD954EDE5F8C116D64B201D8452B6423
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x335AFB2E7B651F19327BFFD91C81654F
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0xB2196B0B7268A06E3A26A9B6F72629AF
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0xA49A31AFFDACD669F130A0384689B1B9
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0xD111D6FD6276D183BD77D98FABD42272
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xC964FBE9F064921D8AAC60F5FD313CFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0xF6B96112FA4B1817939BD0F74A0E3406
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x1F3FDB2A4811410C206581D5004FBB5C
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x4EC4E34CA8C1882B9A32E60796893DCC
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xAF16C4BD3E01282C940F2D75A35EC746
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x3469248CB84A4975413ADAF4CE11C33C
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0xD325AED5C1FAEC95C42EAFDA9A51A3BF
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xD90F8573AC25A10EF24DC2A014536971
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x684942882661F47F5DA042C87284DAC9
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xFBDEFFC755B24A788A15DA38DDEE3B33
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0xBDEC886D522E966F30893403E79D91BC
strength almost exhausted.
0xC8E141742D2A8BC418C8DC8D95C0B863

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x577DAFAFB4DACD229F2AC2AE631159F1
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x40FC14366631CF1D29A997A181A74380
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x843A97A8001CA9E98793630AFCF8AA33
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x70EE44039841DFFE67E271B8D8BA1A9D
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x409E6F54257FF27AD5C1F04FF034B923
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x8A39E0E8413746D50E447D5150BB8A9C
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x88EBEA9A4EE2EEF18BC38C4AFCA38B4C
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0x8B68EE9882CB25402D105C28003E5D55
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0xCD80598474A1EE176227BD6635C896C4
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0xB4C45119A8F27A6E790B3EC922C53121
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0xC463C7ADD389291FE18A9F6924B6116C
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x7470EDF5C9532E68EE696C7F87D45313
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0xDF402FF3598BD020D34C4634AE65D7F7
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x36E2C24F92F13FB17EA14E08D92BE716
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0xE7900EA9CF76D6112432160E7254BCC7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x9ED03FEA052A03A3094BC7F47DC023B4
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x7136CEFECE7C4DA4127AC165F103DDAB
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xA384732249B2C34D71353AF817E97493
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x704BA0CB17390C0105F97DD7B51C8667

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are going, Jane?"
0xFCA8B54B3C3DD6E9ACEFD03B25AD9EFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am going, sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x34EB4D8DEB1791D5D1572DFE13C1114C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x19497B503FF85D81D81077F45D29D584
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0xCE351269091272B5C325784D8BEBA520

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x8C20663AB33CF7C04E2CB505A6E0BED1
firmly, "I am going."
0xF1CEF2C51587FFB84F9467BE9C591B95

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0xA9BA2AEFDDA666D432233A34CC0F53C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x4F5017E8D1B9288ADE82E89CBFE7CBF0
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0x5A6AC566C776EC7553C73BDA7B003BA1
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x0612BD0B509D6F96CE5ADD7D6B5249A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0xEAA7763A7CD9C827FA7A952F382BA422
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0xAA20336049DDCA3C08275B95D8BE1012
deep, strong sob.
0xC83878ED042127A1180FDAB988BD5A69

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0xE6AFB4C7D3307A16CFF593296260A486
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0xDC22E4007D02494FC770CD008AD58EE3
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xEB126E48962F11369AB6C749AAAB9514
hand.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and

wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x7C58E3A5DC672EF942BD793721601C8A
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xB465F228211FC2EBB28587624D50E2C4
yes--nobly, generously."
0xCA41CCB7F5099E450B94EFA5B53C85F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xEC4173AC36F3B2342DDD7B4D3742A327
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0xFA93D58F0968A0E573C47F12B2832BC8
once quitted the room.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x761A112192E1BA41422366DD97D2C6EA
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x5FFE0F5087F56772C77AB3B5DFE82DBB
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0xC204DB706988A91BDEC0FE70BA9D42CE
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x6462C74928EDA2609DB840A8D7CF421A
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0x7C726F8A1C93C32F3131C886D0EA8152
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x26C9571F0F3C059C94CCFC8836D70BA6
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x900AD9EAB09A51070E61C1ADCFFFC779
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x1A36F792CC8A338CED3D5F8214CA8F3E
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x24635111491BB6680B20527C055EBD5B
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x394AF13AB181F0F75447E31C5A4FBC3F
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x8D70EBAF334D8A5626C60C0DBE7A6EE5
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x9F81726CBB9D588F243EFEDD3FC4A391
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0xB914FC8E9B782DDDE8A3CA603C1E0042
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x69DC31154954F43C26E27AFC196456A4
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xC49D17BEC0F0C9693A004D21632EA395

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x8E8057D6DBD1589EDB0697F06BCD5CD3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mother, I will."
0x7EA9A897CBC35D2099EB7FDF1DAE7815

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x08F05484AF0C53301BAE91A4CF4BC4A1
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x5479C70F5432D37B811479191B35752E
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x30D762FBD8C118B513B774A770A64EDA
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0xEC7765E54A003181226D78D63981057A
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0xBE5E3E86F07C6CAB89C804EE96644CC6
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0xA3C3081EE4FC51C2380DA64E93A4C973
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xCB4BF2BF46ECECCFF8D69DF3B2697E60
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x6EBFF036F96CB695C0C90F7CACA91A58
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xE4664D76345501C95C38E9DE9522B3BD
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x55534664FB5BA415355052DCB9A3E047
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x6584F4E433CD38AF5F5DEF0261427780
from my room.
0x4BC7096F96BC4360CDB26214ECE9C5F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x00E32B6090BD469615E2DF09FE444CED
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x12E62C8E82297113B8EA1D9EC9832AEA
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xBA7CC4A50A6B326CB4416EA61D842358
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xA97AAF8A97BF52DC0D6B4E9E62FF0C83

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0x9CF7D68C8D48431A048B6769621E688B
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0xA6A44D550EE4FA2E4CE0A766F3B231C3
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x1182B1EEBEFE4A93E89847C34361DBAA
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0xE7DDBEEB22F4CF068874AAA76FEFE58C
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x47ECE87450072091B643B2E389D0B880
to go in and to say--
0x3F2D34CDB0D57613B8932801C525D794

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x28F588155B4233E682800EA5FCC5F05B
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x055DD539A9E2ECC48AE414B7F75C269E
this.
0xA7BF2EC10C8D85A5EE98E5DDE6A8364A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0xC59E3E37BF1339C06155E0CD37AF3093
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0xCCE81BC17FF1642441FA2E304FFC8ADA
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0xBF6DEE479580FE89F10D2A8FF1D9074C
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xFBD6C1308944B475C6AF7A444ED0DB04
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x5992CED92E07FB04FB42F66BA9DD9C2B
on.
0xCFAAFF45414325F5A007FD336675EF2F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xEFDF6DC059E0749F31B8F826B9950362
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0x4AB2D75ADC58EC328873834226246A71
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0x4A6764EB52F7159B64CDB54391BF37BA
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x4E6906388860D01EBBFF28FA54DD2BDC
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x00C5E227ED2E5CAB55704B3218BE0761
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0xC757E8193E6BF22993B50BFB7705EEBA
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x1E44F9BD4D818FDBA2911AD32F6A6A29
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x405DC3BA165E5499BE288BE851036AA7
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0xCED51F418ACD8BEFE3C081F7F724024C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0xFB56BC1B0F24163ACC1239CFEE9E7002
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x69230AB810A2F283D5FA18B12DF7A695
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0xE0C587BEE2A1224CE9F8EE38454A3858
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x410C9B70515CADF5DBF08B8BFA61C05E
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0xBECCE7CE7CE08673E480822833C6AEDA
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x82D0BB9FA1FD67350F8E862B5413B282
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x5BE4487648DFE5453B374DC6A6920BD7
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x50B71416EB8CB2763A7FCEBE2E911585

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x2D80966C0CEF7FE731866D808EEA5BAE
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x31F0BC12D803C7A604A79CAFCA43C2BF
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x9E3F3EC1DE8CA8C0DC08FC468EB94437
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0x811C064F9EDCF5B6F1B47DBD568D9911
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0xAB29D62EB75CFABC0A216CCD6A9C10DD
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x88CE6DFE2ADDE1EA063EB56D23DCD24A
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x5FCB394AC98862E4F329125BDB6EECEC
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x845D1A6B0A05D7D4D8F0AF6179AE72D7
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x05899C1840AE8C8A9FFD42C84E1FAE04
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xA2CFB4F04172E885D51C3E24999EB90F
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x761FE53E1050855A35B55EFF3E6A7174
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x2579B76BF2D582E3013B7050A0FCB48B
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x6610CAB5DDECDBBB4062C2875466628C
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x816893DD7F3A8D34782C734365A80173
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x91C5C393B4C7381C02FC0EF23D257B36
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0xF731A43E6EA45D5853B80971303A370C
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0x7886A253D5F95D881ECA5434B4F58B1E
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0xF3666E81256AF0C1E807CBFCC13B621B
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x8F376DD53575F4276EEB86887CB57D6E
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0x29B11992449E075695B86B70D3D23179
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x451D30015389FBEC1B7C530EEDB3E24B
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x7AA4C686E1B10DB4DD24DB1CD05F5FA1
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0x0AE3D1FA7E9370A515966CBA1CFFD63E
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x5BB030763D3268BB1785A21F214F2B91
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x76C6586EE465CCBD6D7D19EEEC7F070E
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x510E468636837E93D9171D5501A5ECBF
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0xFB36A388BE0E5C639A7B295DC4FC58CA
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x3882D385004D9230098E2D5036538C87
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0xBF70B47949F326F26B73F088EB286F6D
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xCC339DC414B2C63D30BCA0640E5CCF6C
ever to reach the road.
0x9CDAC9C88E6B15AE9BF9B6918E4B7980

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0xBA5C37984F331C78DE4E3DC3E9F00A88
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0x035B526FC9CD18FA845E2D2E647505B9
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x1F189E42BCA2C4909683241AA14E3889
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x51491B877954566B6BB73236DD4E0D05
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0xF11D1264777004374232DDC234DFD90B
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x971EE63CA1CEB2C43CD71B1D43DF9257
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x6A1F14E682C7C28D4DADC78A8DDCF0F6
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x30903BE61E568A93F5B8A0979CFB86C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x4B4C890D3565E68DE33740631DCF3B25
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xBD6D24609965FE7C231F324FDD179042
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0xCBE1127EC6F400DBA4B9E1B01B1805F4
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0xA0BC7A433A32472D3E955B96227C17BB
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0xAF9CCBCCEE5BD7FEEF911120A89E0398

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0xE8BD1B2B0B812099CA561269AC255AB7
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0x0C04705B97CE3244269986FC18BF7249
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xDA0AB1CA924A10756AC118302643BEC7
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x17934C1A3385CAD1DC01129E173F76B8
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x6A6E9D0813E72C175F8EB76D3F38FB9A
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x317AAD3C0112CDBC636B10C1125017B6
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x007BA5DCE98D2AC60F8448A26E566FE3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x579F917CD729A80B9F9D46123B080D81
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xA78080FD6DC20C304600DF9915186E19
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x5F3E74E71334562B36DE92371ABED116
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x3A4CA113476623F70A4586C04CD02396
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0xBC85FDDE6EF095293D1F214AF0C65C34
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xF5AA3CB41EB3792204378689ADB42E1C
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x27B801767B9A2F93395F4FE912930E24
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xB0B5AA7407DEFD1DF5861206C8A54621
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x6B1E49FA113FDD76DF2BE143F1177A74
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x367BE42B7278F7C27F0E164D14547AE6
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x1B7EF7FF899010AA09EC7C06B170D687
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x6C51DFD188E2572B3E295A2FF8E52CAC
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0xD404D36C97D0732D8AB1D7AAF262A8F9
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0xB5F02BFEC529CEDF242DBA1F9C4056AE
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x0D8BEA7E6614811BB7A5AAA154E8DF13
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0xE171FD8B2ACF7E262B41CA349B7272DA
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x1E08B620B6371DBF905A02CE54399FFC
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x6F84DC73BBEB1F71D725CA21067DD09C
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x8DE5DBE7BE8C9CB976EF6F5AEDB0BCEB
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xEE0C0F11DDC019FB83DDA929B20EE1AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x8782AB9A3419E564F7A505187C3AB0C6
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x07028F36CD81759A192DF4FCF68A1B0A
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x6EAAD6F1D2D786018B08661E8013BE19
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0xFE61DF0C14222987EDBE366301DDEC7C
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x8F939583864104C9E7EACCAA56F03493

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x1C26039B83ECF39C05AD19BEA9A4AB1B
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x4BAC335B1836671CC823CEA250566BD2
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x99872B4736B4F585FDB1108ECA379315
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xEF1C33E21E7371C2D11C8A0F47F64496
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x9122E7B42571122F484943E81BA66E29
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x9D0B0663425B86BB9CE134732A25A989
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x4B3514D84FC50871A77DCEE29866C823
regained the faculty of reflection.
0xD219A00323F02AF85A08CD000FA05FF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x36BFA0CF8CB79716CE9A5D5DEDB3525A
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x334DAB0A18A09121B415D50A140F7764
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0xE24620126FF3320CED06FFF0BEB963D3
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0xDDABACC923D589101BD6B42B867B98DF
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xB4DD24C320D65D9728A87D96C69294CD
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x162E4AD86F4787EF8CFC5FC75D2B7443

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xB151C16CA21AF6D271F0C7756F3A12E5
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x36EAA8B9FB4769C838DA4427182B6DB8
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x20692DED9D1C44C4D78D61EA6D251F0C
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x18B867FEA45EA724E6680EE879068EB1
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x73A655B6C9ED157F904C758291637AE8
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x6D6CE2ED31A5BA4F6C3AAA1351E1A83D
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x7C799A18C3A461811DE513CD73D84E83
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0xC672396CD6487B7EF547574C3DC4D168
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x3AE0499533B203C7F7398B0263D06B4B
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0x6ECAE19A6CD4E07D563AC6F1CF632BB7
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0x110188AF9132938EF85E16C89E4FCAE5
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x2DFAFC706E6BDDA6573EF15000D899FF
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x08198F9E89C046AA21DD4095BC816019
then chose my couch.
0x0CB9226F42F2ECD321D51A8A555314B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x1225693E2B71921E1569DA106B1904F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x750C8FE2CBD2B9BD61D04895536BD464
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x18BAADEB17DD29EBCE9D3F5E71E2A624
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x6E4F093C549299389C717E59C90A5FBE
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x992CC783644FED8D67AC7F6F4C9E6138
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x0A340F9C61B46C0171EE52EE6FAFA7F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x23990D5AD740AE8B442C50A7EA64866D
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xC03480C56433BC7C215F596D21AC2F7B
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0xFE8E39F315EB42856A2E5C80E142A09A
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0xD320186E5D957930BDBC3EF0B8BE7EFC
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xA0EC2E5EF3511423C09F96CF33004221
attempts to seek him.
0x74DDF9129B16BA9D7FE671718F7C310A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x69CBE8ED2A426BB16C907A6B406CD530
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x8EC14380C261F252B5B6191191DBAF66
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0x5FF6A93CD2650C77280D2B1D268A7F7C
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x6A7122BD6A5696D84A33BD1D2DF027BC
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x237B029CF8B761ED8AA7EA5D24974AA9
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0xD1243CC7CC078040BAC7B5ABD9304659
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x7AE41339C71D736A5B0F0EAC053AB9BE
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x29C4E75F59B4F0A2933609A05F060D14
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0xDD4F3DF8F7928CA4F33B8DEB43F167D3
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x52109D5A9C8EADD670380E17B5764B28
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xC473C811D9E622F947A0F4150D32C96B
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0xE8722D6D8D41D14CF06304D3708760E5
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x5061B027650BA8C19A69C719D79AE984
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x6A17D8C951830DC757B3A681398E8188
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x69F1DB29A9A208A25D2E718CA6B3FEB7
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x435161B11D9BA248EC181743C10FCA3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xDD7029ED6B31C83EDC937351F8827EDE
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x9B6C8BFEAC25C08316AF29F4CD089D8C
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0xC4ED26EEC85A7AA518A5FEA688E0477C
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x879A0E10EC3E1CE2987A53CA94108D58
looked round me.
0xE6AAEB24D9114FB1BDED333FCF74E431

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x8B7A61E4A9A897A91DBA4C251694F168
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x3C9BBB163BD6E71BCAA55FC03C938194
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x56D5A9F814C5B26AA303787FDACC97F8
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x0F160BA2CEB091610305616C1FB4A920
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x60C32343FA0F83AC965281A8A6D55741
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x6C7C9F456E0DB621D3C11726B888C506
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x0D3B0779044852CE66D6BC213DF97C27
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x61D0B98D96E6395A6B26511A20A3510B
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x3D1EBD77124C657A897B6CB88089CE51
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xFA6CA616C4AE44C3318D4983E9D33124
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x48B09FA7DB4B5C40FE54D3EC48C56A0B
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x1B41861DDA260013F99954BD1E365FEA
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0x75FE248F6C44C6CB4E0CA26EDB629179
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x1F36616AB62988E3110A656240FB1993
out.
0x43FF84B542F6373303D32C52FE390DB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x2948CFF34AB281464C770A8752C31B5B
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x4314A8F6AABAEDEB64F1C7AB47A5A3F3
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x454AEDE3F3A9A0DB96464561BFC87021
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xC0F2CAE0A5F0EFCB043D42CFFB945313
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x9D7C77B2AD0726DD60399E3C47CAA692
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x7B51093077E464C5172F29AA54C51CFE
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0xDE69B2002CAC608FE59C4D7966FE3524

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x29B5E4AFA6C4FC252F43CF923B036ACA
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x0AE432841B4E7E26E18F8901B8099287
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0x5EF4123157EC59FC25771C092ACA5AA3
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x2DB611CB4724D71BBAED48B501B0439D
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x32FB183CEA83B0DC9851122A6DB17A50
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x12A7D4580C8258BC41DEAD4C1C5895B3
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x7D50A0200358E26D4FCA3DD230282A7C
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x534355B294D4BD6CFD3C6645CF5E85D2
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x22ED1C2A7DD6588520BDCD9EB9CFC7F6
like the rest.
0x8B2692DDFA23FBEA31364A4E08ECDFE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0xF11378365DB6B7A8C6B414A8EAC146CC
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x358E96AF001D5A7C982CB928D288FBAE
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0xB4E52ADA0165E021E6B5706CD374B7FC
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x554B0512609094F98E220B01C5404757
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x1CB1E1C5AD9ACAEB7E2FCADA4FEC6DEF
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0xDFB3ED3960180446043EBEF4C3D3CEF2
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0xE1616659B8F5516E6C9D976F22FCCC1F
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x83D4EB8FAAFD7F1CDF56A74066EF3547
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x0538B2CDD4BE6253E255F84645CE17A0
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x2585AA728113FCCE2F2234C154822D3E
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x982ED77D40B23FB2A58C6CC796C2A8AD
would not; but I must try.
0xB37A13B325CE833D615F4C8445779406

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0xCFF1EFD79AB5ADE061D6C204CD6F65E0
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x058246069BBC52519BE5EC6B6CD19697
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0xD5AC62FEFBE6D20FCDB38B8FC10A216C
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0xB2DFBF0D44202BA99C8DB8E7C3F1AAF7
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0xFC1A6843FBB5375B1338A974A019CE99
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x9156DB8AD5A43FFB97DA7B2A366FDC5D
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x622F18A1EB2B7A96A26C12862679DACE
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0xC9E67468C76AD74B2DF0C9981ED15A5D
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x10A92E4CB62DCEAC09040E14E3266C9D
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x520C06A0A47FE6597B6B45CAE566803E
the village?"
0x45C567D67F26C4ACDB34AC264F3AF403

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0xB16E8D76989AEF09D77A57B9C9E26651

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0x53E35F8270D0711A7DEC81ECF5898039
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x88B19ACE500DD6A99690A057F1D2FE89
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x5EAC35C07936EB843334911A5DD26A3A
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x3BC13E06507002C1B6F7F5CA2D264305

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x95882FE1B3695987CC149497B558BA55
wanted?"
0xF89F30DE236A3AA00B948E004325D9E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0xBD02A6CF6FE211BCB0892CFE8EB83411

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x18EE88B2B1308D3BAE7809587712C7B7
do?"
0x4A1F8E1745D8C7F0419B08EA4D3FA857

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x1B246A624498CE1A7F6905B54028EB5D
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x50F83134D504C78D50A3D2202FCB31F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x794CD7E0FFE7D6C06E6D620A2445D2DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nay; it was men's work."
0xEA25CC1736F51B514CC7AFCBE15BDF17

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what do the women do?"
0xC84D6BFEEEDBE9CC8D8AFF7AA282F5C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0xF1DE29D4B9EAE57DDA786643D29804FF
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x08E72AE73BCF6BA7E3B4F864678F1DD8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x14B952BB788089B98230328CB6A79D48
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0x27FDDE7D4E9C8C3CDB46BF54F8193061
wanted.  I took leave.
0x68FC2770D8D14514207EAAE7B5684F01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x0C430DBFEAAD3C8C11E21A22C7D510BC
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0xF166107CD3131AA9C425DC67AF3A2CD0
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0xF71A0CD0FCB6EC3DCC603735DF335D39
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x5F5AE9B8064F6BB9F083C10ABCDE4EFA
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x5106CBAB7C224E2D4D981D5DD05A0E3F
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xAE76CE69C515953CD24EDA6F7D528DDC
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x0818D83626CEA97B88B0040964429955
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x433B75C44FBFC3B485BE9E0751E52AC2
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0xB3EE1B1215BE69A4E2FAB5E02E063D9C
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x90A16B7456CB939F1A1D487CE6DF00D9
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0xD74712DBE77B6BDFB0154479A1D69275
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x6B7012FB19BF0E59119E7A5B5D7E4FC1
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0x75C62696875A1695A0843DE6EF22F6CB
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xA2E6013B1750065E832E863D87C55EAB
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x7AF07D649F45E017F53C2F43CC967599
if a servant was wanted here?
0x4931FA63A718D1F7202D063DCCD824E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x1462B8E4925F1CED5A7561CB3A5F95B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xA4F9C3833DA41433A27F917AF08AA425
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xB00F53DEAF53AA4A9A29EA4F14D1750A
no matter what."
0x0183442BB0A0CC2F547AD73582975B7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x348BFE7EA25D1D4D926195220F87CE96
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x7C8D25D8877E10BC8508764F94073B44
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x0A47110680BDC09762912D3828DD5D8F
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0x65F3BA8FD2C3B4DE5C8DDAF4F2C75120
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xBA96F663DAD3C7906F2B43BAB0E3A606
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x66636FFE8FFAC5732C36079B99BB1B4D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0xE29E9DAF079A574B0774D106BA85C4A8
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x883350B9D5DC6E44C89E9ED66EAC5291
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x1824E3FE90D83183B60F3DFD617455A7
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xDD197376AF1E5540D29CC08C1529C5C2
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x80B531E76F0653EBA3B6000E86A8BF90
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xEAD62B2331D274C9C872201A3DC537D2
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x6BE5CDA211D4FE56794320686FC7BE6C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0xB088ECDF4DB04DE3FDC328954BE1A8CC
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x3FB916F2080EA8A704C91CDC1628A623
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0x7CE8F8225EC2425E29AE935589D66AF1
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0xFA5950471050DC4F4FDD0AE2E4C4CEB6
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x29DC5F5231808EE35F2387DD64223AE3
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x874A593E142D29E9AC28E340FC46DF32
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x219C013E4126A7AB7BAC72146AE82872
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0x43704D2FA68BC2420B7FEA16C8ADA71C
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0xA74B007A8AA831E96643614F74EB1443
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xC1C6AA2C2FFA718A8AB079DBBB235117
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x66C224BF753BC5B09398CEF92AF9DCE8
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xE07DBA0F6AF6A336CFD492BD5BBED828
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0x7810D1550291031DA634824C07FB4326
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0xC0CB974C2677999FEFB75F2D202DCC37
this the parsonage?
0x197D9510833DEAB92467155631B1AA53

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x099E4CFB6FE42C0E5F69E84545769EAE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No."
0xCE36EF61FB1B0510BC0DAC4717647CEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would he be in soon?"
0xB2B069B4D8A3757B5CB5E88CBCC983E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, he was gone from home."
0xCC21FB44E1002F0921E265E73DA09342

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To a distance?"
0xD0A80D8C22A7C490EF85A28D34E5CEB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x174E0F85525F177C1DA853DC32B3E79B
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xFF7F13D2BEC383BAEC50980AC35898DC
there a fortnight longer."
0x530AE3ABE7BA69D541658DDDFDCC9DAB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x0A4A994130ADC66EC04FE1DAF182BF7D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x7A26A809C1D729C8D25E9CB79E996E5D
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0xF425BD1B6CDDF18C796C71B9B953FD0B
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x097F05166D78BC5C4D156325920A6255

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x6A37CD1E15C1F55E28F8FA7F900B5446
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0x22D227223C9EF32F64C9382665D97FCC
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x2FE04A54BA03A4FE1DB594B1FD5DC663
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0xD00C0E5D377A4F905762CEAED1ED1090
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x1471736EAC9D4A2B54C38D5192678C09
for this handkerchief?"
0xC9FAC8694FF3D0FA59EB4988E1D3626F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xBDB320B485E352AE98BF4C7406BE2615
that way."
0x4203A35A653F6D8465CC111AFF45A7E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x8D24AEBC67DF1A47A22A2C9CF5B04CF2
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x6BCE889C00552AC7CBBB13A2B3179BB0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x1DFE051DFEC5A7DB2D2E221EE050DB26

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xA64EF3B2BD28A8C66A33D99B8C2F1838

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0xE40C14E14F897CBAD234A3B360535845
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xDAA75D820CC0B981EC218A61FD9F5056
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x9B528ADB22B469E51163F8E8D14CE22F
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0x09D2437470A72ABCDEEA5F63B0D74538
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0xC652C44505A2BA247936FA5F285294CD
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x14384254614D50B32B37005A132E823F
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0x0DB2E209E113CD27073B614049FE30A6
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x41F328251D4532F7EBAAB40D307BF211
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x47D475FAC92D77638AFA172BA9854DD7
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0x21D29A81F46BA89F08BC4AFEFDF8F0DE
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x9AF003284390A921CD2EB720A180AC14
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x5E50AF786FB897696E69F98B164C2AC3
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x3AD9E090333472B66914F751A446494A
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0xCF48AE0BAB2476A3F35E01258AF13FF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xCE6F2750681621D0AAA257B98A15DD39
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x2C7FD9368502600F95FBEF8DEF8AF63F
said--
0xDCF95D24795728D92DCC8E0069262D13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0xB6D651C0816C71F4754177CAADABF2D7
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x51818A76ADF4CDC146E856884DF1B0B9
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x9FE6F46A7277FF482E2753594A2CC02A
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x31240005F60043F2471A45A96F5C99E8
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x404EB39B6A6A71F7C6100C6EFBB34851

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xE1013EECFEBE0DA1DD8079420C6217FD
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x2C4CF37E598589113E329A144D5A6AF1
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x6156317933CC563A576674561F61536A
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xC84B81B73698161EF947447C67A4FC4E
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0xA7B33AAD740110CB2B699E4295DAFE72
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0x995EE447835C69CB397820E430CEE303
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0x4E288C8A879BC8EA6022DE5473767DBE
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x90458B86DD7319E2893B8B922B2403C5
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x97F9344548CA72F2EE7A1CF03EC3CB5E
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x63438FA508356BA2AC959D50E335E74E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x4C70E54AE4911AFD1B2855D973CEE7F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xB57FED8179EDDBAB8D4582E6EA6A6486
give her these porridge."
0xC4EEF2996E8828EAADDB075AC774778B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0xD9BBCDAF90F542461769C3D6C92D3558
pig doesn't want it."
0x6930107C3F726ED9C0FCEBB8A213BFFA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x5F96A6DF97FADF472814C3792BBA2489
ravenously.
0xD52EEF3810BE40485C82CC807D2F0FE0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0xF4224F7F7F6CD64C6EFB86B8F661A1D3
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x26851442ADD75160DF964A11462A865B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0xB6A832E4EBF0627C2A8DCA777CBA5FCA
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x6C6A72A8010633DA61DD8ACBB1FEC184
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xAB4D5F30BA7E385D41978D40C9E3A86F
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x4982D538C8CE9A25336FCB98E4457751
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xE8234D28DD63310961652E92F1284F1D
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xA5DC42CC8726358C44A1EC3099D37CD8
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x615CFA5BB9EA1560816E87F622E6E0CF
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xA97B227F26AF60C0458B4EA12B21655F
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x93A16DC76F37F7A22597740D1C4368D9
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x9FFBF807D78B2F2465F9B2EF9E5CBB90
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0xDA186992B7D18619DBB4E562A58E9B28

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x38276D601D4FEA6820B1B16B292FEA45
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x9469907ECC22D2C43F3E0D07226F4BFA
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0xDA53FB2B31045C78B58DB395786B40F0
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x74857DDFC35A4AC7DBBC9F785D795A00
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x6762E256EF2680BFADE6306600AEFE80
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x7FCE7CE491170771AC0ECEAC0E59E4EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0xA045BB2F5EF4212E0121081DEB68C00E
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0xBF240D463ED20B5D6DAA604E09E1FF24
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xFE1B707A190193729629CB1B7FB8AA9E
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0xD21742EDB48518C39915CFB9CE73881A
grave."
0x277AA9F7BBEB74303DCEB268EE84810A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xEE54EE3916A17E544CA20BA0769EE1DC
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x2DF097035A4771B1F027EF4C8333C750
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x15C2F3DD2C36960ADB4C6C28A94DD814
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0xDBD0DD5EBCD090FDE41BB26B15FC7EBF
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x85FC7A8718B28B8CB76D481C5D3BB6EF
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xE5B69920A0693289E494AA5D60C2EEEF
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x25891B6CA0FCEC7089715C4A1CA3FAF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xED68C715D3BE4338DEA64C9C6D011FAE
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x19767311D511F0B76E6FB458292E473D
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x56C2EA3317B0C6149F1CD7E8EF69004B
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0xF24E31C4D61824FC7EC991338063A9C4
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0xFFC3A5C355DCB89664184A9EBC071F7E
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x3A5473BF3CE2CF2283F63AAAFE9D1B5E
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x939DEE1F571E6EEADFD33447CE885689
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0xB182A7FA1BCEEE9ADACB71C898983B24
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0xFE3EA091AE384F1933151C423B9E0033
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0x39AEEE3C2E83107FDCD632B0626522D7
it shut in my face."
0x574A506DE46EEE4A2370A27B7B938922

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x43B97893FE6B1F92EAD26BC761FBD7D6
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0xE87ADFF7D4BC95E641984A9C01CB37D7
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0xCB8FD6837773763B4C99F803E0E9E569
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xFD9A8BA3D47DD0C355ED611964C76A18
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x8755A73291941B67655160D9E414B406
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x5E94CCFF2CCC43216178CE39AE3AB904
long.
0xA676546FDC2D4098428CA90250AE763E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0xF835DF43769738E58B544E801C1FDF55
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0xC53C3C34D050C8F3157B9B0DE99A5401
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0xBECDAA75D9A49A01AAC14E3B7C3391E2
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x9743D59D7B3CCB9B2BDA40CBF0D1E0DC
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xE145C3D0EACCEED404A80489933B181A
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x51E2328A0DE6760C9CFBB27E0FDE335B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x7738D7272492A0AF7A50D1C4F8917E7D
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0xFCF42617C57C846B029F528B7D810842
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0xA5BB141FCAC6EA88D583BD712915AB94
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x38F537AB5F19EA2E56A47E23F5583ED5
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xB45764CAE831183F91BAD1CD99E22E9F
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x2247924DDBFAF39F5949F1EA3DA824E4
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x69FA7B598AB0190608C5F47867A94847
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xBFAF14C016B580259EE6704C9FC1FD15
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x6BA3DCD66E976B0BA6D668C24CA7FAA6
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x949C21502C018322022F7175162B9F79
sable bush-holly or yew.
0xE0450E13BE57B4D088143A11141125EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0xCB6D5EFF42C3BC05A45B087E17C82BEE
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0xD83BC5020B2E18D676454516AA41C480
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x7B309F9517D1CC3F1F4AD198B02491FB
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x56B813A48315F40150F8A3EA4E58BC53
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0xE983A5FD932F2EE943567D163E0DACD2
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x0169641FD86CB57876A014FC2FC197E4
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xF0E4D56AF7CC1AE801A3FA0DEAF43CCE
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0xEC16C9D8258684310806D1ED5DB899FA
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xAB3D90D01B7F6BFCEC5D38AF92220EF6
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x2CB9DEBEE953F49D9171BE5564D050E4
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xEF8F6CABFB7CB00ECB343E7D8E470D91
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x49A9CC453ED6EF7B47880F68035DD880
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x8AF11F7DCFF423E1F7FDF026B96657F4
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x556BC02E288340F37B36426FB39457CA
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x18A24E85C2531F0227401940B2CE339E
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0x517E1A11B6DB83147378FE7301BAE3F8
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0xE0E1182EAD6BF6549511256DFCF9EFE8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x4ECDC61A8C928AFA2AA031EC0081ADB8
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x086F6C7FDB6CC7AEE21B82F50BE9FF46
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x22FB45F815E0730CA6951592EACA676D
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0x52814E4892CE3B2DB4027C98F3687B2C
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x22B31AD6DAA784C027E67908C2F8E020
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x949F8DC76BA30B51DD27E26D215A7D6E
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x45A24A7CE0A88219FAC67D5B70F426FA
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0x4186091DE78414709CE0CD59344B4DA1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x31937220D886702D33DF503BA2103E50
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x75487D15176A39B61E79AF20EF9A470E
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x98E60F80D49B91CB1C8B1F4A9FA851E1
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0xDBF7370998DCD941632DAF770F060788
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x942E35D08AF9B24E1C19EBEC79A65E31
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0xEA4AF3EBCC4AD5FAC17C5CA631C7E5A6
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x81873AF41AC50F6307B41323F71090A1
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0xAFB341D38A3221CAC941BBDF33AF4891
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0xC5A053D4CFEAD4B1CFD30C7E2BA6D559
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0xEE3849E4B5DB7C43F7AED68235CA4F45
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0xDBDA3A74F57FDF98080BC96DCA08508B
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xE17B1AE408D38A6191053E6D2EFA410A
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x2B77F2C7C55FFEC2B7C13C9CD561D984
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x21970F7E4D2C1BC6B54764999ABC5990
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x78DA73748FBC2459E8C89B124DD35ABE
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0xB54672FD0D731F1E9FF1F2D44CFCA8F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x2296B23BE6D12CE8F702F182FA77974D
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xE9976D8A15E5FB036CF67B54EF3AAF81
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0xD137FA327DBE7AB83EB81D9C253F4167
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0xDA876D9732161588D39346A058F149DC
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x2BC2D734FC7E379EE8085198CEC1EDF6
German I could not tell.
0x43D9A9921F8E874586CFF666853A8926

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0xD854FFB9D2756D364F3D6CE423EF9A5C
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0xF70C57155A3FC7CD9301258F4660E76F
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x4C8F68D68E933DCC686F9EF630CEE200
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0xD22951B71CE9D301AE2C374EB0696F27
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0xA9A31143283BC5F8E98F64DC3EAACF92
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xB09358051E7A67E517D2FF12520C65EB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x30275CC0BE4BE35D869C8616362CAEC7
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x681C141DEEC40C0643944B530366175F
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x9FF3AED491E119B9A9C40E6AA6B602EB
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x26FA236841CF25C6C65142341855CB3A
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x03C655739AD432C0606878AF8A62430B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Both were again silent.
0x5E0DC58B21EFD708FD3848F44EE51553

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x3F172E039ABC552528280E901CD5CDE9
looking up from her knitting.
0x630AFE726F173401BDDF5889655F6D74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x3314F928B5B48215FCA917BA7AE15908
other way."
0xF1B015EBBC3E6D53FE52F5BA0525B254

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0xD5C05739BB86377800E1CF5437A7E317
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x65F6F8A028A9146C615440698C9EA724

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x2EC8A47D81174288EF0E4A56318BD809
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0xD59862687CB79C58FAE38DCF27B49905
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xD36BE74393BD57942D47C78A9A8B5542

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what good does it do you?"
0x184E1F8C9716D07CE228AF9BE55312F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x6CB208F412CB4FAF6F1A8E36C493DAD8
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x4A92CFF326E9D11FD924AE85B239986A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0xC278FB87D53F1D5A52B631CE67B3157C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x7E914F69A5B4707B8CF8209D436CCC61

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x7B7603BB8710F2292728166491AE7442
master but a lexicon."
0xE376382B0182CB3C068CF072016732B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x61CA136596E7F0D53C8931CCD762B0ED
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x6BBB2AF25DFBAE6AB23C0D294836356A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0x25E129A0344128E410A79C71035DF315
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0xFBE84F5CCA435DD389C79473F2052AB0
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xB8FF26C9E114D5CEE93C5F81CEC81EFA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x7517DB497E9D6CCE6A3476CC2130035B
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0x18C81AA78BE5BAE22DEB75AEE615EBFF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x68D4BC3AA0952B11348514C02092E1EA
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0x025C086ED58E6B61AF417DE6524F27CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x1C1EE0A5A5F0F877F99AB11426D2A76B
sad now.
0x86090F2E56CB651E48266E8DE13F7245

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x1310A4E1011C3BE1E130ABEE9AF68CC8
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x5777BAA36519C82BF58B6C8A265E943E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0xFCC541C81618C560072534673C1F1DCB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xCD5175DE5F7468AA10F042BDC546DD83
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0xAE1E49E4E7F5083E549A84E1C2E419B2
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x54F9397A8D413F2025E3422F858C9AD6
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xD71580940BEF84AE8959642E3C04F406
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0xA57F3115714CDE5C1E22318602FA924E
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x42BFA821A02E7702BEAE76B73687CAE6
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0xCAD4442B586428BDB9650B3D90E6EA5C
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x360B39F01CDAF1E3511001B8A3BD7A45
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x227F1E08226C5D4582980E52E93BA5BB
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x1B4EEFC76FF1449AC25893D82BD56102

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0xDD3464FCB0AD82FB59787540681ABA9C
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0xC66BD41EAC499B1BC5B6B00134C491FB
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0xB35AC144117781DC9112138FA5A698C7
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x0402FF81843A8FEA9FB4CD4D96F9ADE8
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0x677415FBD3939E463EF4EC7B2D2EDC1F
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xEE6C9483FE532A777155D513C97888BE
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x95FBD96B61AB33FC5C9985E002BBB39E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x3F397663ED8FC69873D026F0D9C6D131
St. John when he comes in."
0xB236F98DB97C79814E98242DF48492EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x3A2EFA92083603DFB71AA64E0CB6CFF6
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x6D50AB4251E2662009BB56F490872AE7
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x7D1F0F2DEFDB12F8F10E45F3D0A562FA
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0xDDB9D6450C0BFE82D4FF372F04CCCA16
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0xC65D2F0458E84F5850207D81F9B0314A
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this

house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x41CE42DC4B4BBFA4A156F5D08B14B43F
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0xBB982DD6F2DA33117998E9A8471FA37E
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x457CBFCD92008CC7662598C901CD281B
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x2F8E669074B5EB0966C335C31E710264

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0xB263AD00B333906F18CAD79F11B67AC9
me by the light of the candle she held.
0x0EE233C10B848E7A5A776DBECFD83578

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x8B42B7CA0B7FC9C30999990E1613DAA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x6B02CC02AA4E18887AEC8BEB1C79601F
from?"
0x26A6892D4D22BA1D3E7E37DB1BC9D770

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am a stranger."
0xC9AEA8FA0E49E99A38992608EB513D77

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x7815F1836545283D5A2C7FBC19AA37A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x131D38974AAF8692CD8F838CDE827297
bread to eat."
0x958D94EDA483655338559EB9F78DC111

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x5A058C7788ED53DA8D6D42D7DDB03C60
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x5A6C69484A509545C80804CCFFCAFA4C
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x6A5CC63E47934E1C94844EDD8D451410

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xFAD96B46B45E454D39FF12E7CAEEB049

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x1124C0603D458B6F071F182C2069C284
now; it looks very ill."
0x270A763500850C57EC7754DEC2F53EA4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x7FD95B5A11C189607EB13186E1D2A130

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0xEDC4CE45EECBE678A7E4A501B50FF4E5
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0xDE5B4B700BBA072F638163718B63E43D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x03F5DC613D29C978539B6136F34A5998
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x42BB6A09EB456D36B61370FBBC8ED87B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x6804684E93945BEA8F7A07E7E8E481DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x0AC19D05DE8F59CB06CD4D38DB9682EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0xC62E5A31D878ADF21B0B495F2C22E809
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x45488E62507A402255DD615F436C925D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0xD86915ED1A5B5D6A271B6CE7A71F27AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x8B002F427539261846405169F874E5AB
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x0F86596475A9D1AE8A545E0818E42634
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0xB573BC6F3A8C1078E279CB2235AA25CF
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xE3BA566F145CEA5228DF5B00689CAB91
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x3D1A200138ABED19717C416C3BFC2B29
bolted it within.
0xD1080C5050FB93A72AC2C19F9A414EAE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0xFDF91D47446B3769A3DB04B8669EA8FE
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x059D7D3D0D9AA1189327B134BB0DB056
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0xC1254B3E879371927EDBC41A984F3D27
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x7B17452099AE58DB61E657EF881FF4A9
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0xDE2ACA17B83620C879505A0FE4EA3656
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x935A980D42C2409FF92BC074DA941107
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0xE0E4DC852EF04999FA820617417BD4D2
endeavoured to regain.
0x2EB63342EC3EE24280FCB9984157B7DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x69413190D3013DB97662682E461E8269
will in silence."
0xA276C290C9E2C44C1C43DED6AAB87440

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xF5700C611BA64C54799B78D5DD188BBF
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0x7A98D90778487317D26C9240DC459466
and still.
0x06A0A4181D199FB8DBCE405AAD6B30C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x8E62E6ED76B22EBEA4387B98B00863C7
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0xE41918B441AEED501C9BF3C996C84654
if you perished here of want."
0x142542D27E273CB69679FFC015BE2D34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x937F2DC368C6E83B74679C9F234FABBA
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x82B69F24F591A7A62D3877494DBEE178
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0x09FD4CA6F59388259911E2AFEB8B005D
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x32E0BFD9EFFD585CA3C5628DC1FED33F
to the door.
0xB649411B084F9A5474833609B8E38BB8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0xEF00496351D4FC3326DDB9075174644B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x8A97A3DAD500E3447C7618A38DC31C24

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x482046F6180C23BF0568ABF3AF21736D
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x2F237A33FF302E1C1BB474952EDC84C4
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x4002D526A06C22C7A813ED7B7E424D2A
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x9414247F96ACD96A0AAC701125E6BEB7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0xC7F913755DE27640EE13713E0CC17E32
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0xAE0F2A16BF72696DF38212472005DE13
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0xF1247688B6338B9C5BC8CB415FBBBC82
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x7C156B6F32C1437FC18AB93225398C3B
house."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xDF89D2BAEB56D3068555C4E6F1076ED9
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x9080CFA80F2967286DC5313B6BE102CF
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xB0A0226B51924463C88A0CC33741AA7A
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x5B0439F508ABF01FF83FBAE1ADDF5F43
me.
0x567A9B2B16F92D6B6E4C92F75468A693

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x1C630AB54F05053D22B9B52B25F97F82

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xED48C7E95070F2DF7AF2C520B9884869

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x80BC1B79C7B164E1689A3E6C1FD6F998

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x0BF0055658B8DE7D4DE07F0F918C1D76
sit."
0x8BA2B971427FFE6F5BF386B665C73E8C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xEEA240DB3BEAFF8A90F5AB0E7D979A5D
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x176D20B5CDD3E315A9A6007EFA5DB821

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x7FA897F9607380E5FDA1D04E56419B27
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xCE5EDC144F78704AEDB2A0EDB6193AED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A mere spectre!"
0xBAE50BE429C01A888A1DE62732F14F6D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x1C035A9A899944F1866578555890830D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0x33335523AE960D8AE7BE10323F200BF3
bread."
0xAA9570698270085AEB59EE5CA5D6866C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x3BBB9FFEB3D14439687DF21090F6B55C
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0xC92D0B6B9AC7852F73C1CB68BDDC3B93
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0xEDE17EBDF94FDC9168FFD8A5F1272178
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0xEF2EB2D144E25DE38E54740474B70CE8
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0x81C219D04B58FEA95F987BE7A19F8183

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x07023776C15AA3F56CE5AF4083E8A17C
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0xE66D6E221B2E255653514AEBBF73057D
first, eagerly soon.
0x8E25C49D1BAC429697E9C7E4702011D4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xCAE0BB66CD1C83C0568F5BCA1C1EE323
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x247806DC625079A4DCEA3B4A91194694

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x4BC43A6A5B2A555F905439F95C5DC64F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0xAC2E9D5897E162D538FEE61678314A9E
name."
0x7E61E56C6FEC149F6B5B9F845D3DAFC2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x4043351B67BFEAD72814DA41AD5E2E1B
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x8D7B9E4E33300CDAD61A6F63749CD486

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x5C90B02194FDC08B35094F74A116F607

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was silent.
0x9851C073AC94FAEA7F4EF02384A03AFB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x13DA5AACA52ADC1844FF11EFBC53BCCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shook my head.
0x0FBCA6F1A3AF1F3592982AFB0AB1A45D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0xBEB4FEB71B42F1F72EA03F64E335E44D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x3DF376CD18B2DE06ECB1C36155C9BC83
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0x4DE811E8DD919FBCBC2D5CADBB6082F3
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xC9EE12567EE390560A74821F001C54AC
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x60350F68C0E9D6082857C58F4F7219C8
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0x2429D820BA6521FA4D698109D454BF9D
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0xE08F355D8FCD3D22E1EF1EF112892DAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0xB34A90A78F83CCF65E2B321FD9139E0B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x6C71721CE1947EE861ED4EFD6BF9A4D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x53AFC60CC7A508D70B61DB96027B9C2C
took the word--
0xE467B0BE2BE392C5964DFC48506281A1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x1CEFA8CD19B9A1514EC37AC54F8CD709
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xF2FF5B61B775F92A8D8AACFF5F3EB5BE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0xE4CE15CC2E61DB2E8A5EB48E5063DF67
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x131AAFC8469639A22182E94DAB443C41
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x3ABE625F88DE2E729D75747568AB3669
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x4E66C9EDFAD8BBB2562054B18BFAEF0D
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x5508250F132B70CE1E58F1451FC88B72
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xDD32F11911B0355445020761F409A5BF
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0xAD57DC6223D7596814F6294B4EB815F4
silent.
0x17F6AAE49338FCD64C37A250E7C2AC2F

"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xBFC4BD6F203856076E336E315A8FEB91
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x356BAE8DC367C21480D40B605FC20D29
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x25ECB49A5CD8AD6A139A3FFE63817EF9
matter over."
0xE87D83C9BCF216EE95AC886F942374AF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x79D95F3B568C7554D9AAF6A81A210D6A
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xD61369607E764E25056C44AF0421E8F9
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xEB9CA36AB9D7D94A0736ACA5492E7850
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xCCD1FE2BA9781A1F02D15A2DAFFABC01
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0xC07D36D5AED6730C0C79B1F99219072C
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0xD4D0A4E4DD0FEE29055E2F0452147FA1
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0xDC1EA2902F6062D24E58CAC9E0CBC5DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0xEB8953D8E032D5F64B7FEB13BD7B590C
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x7AEBE68FD51E3C6758DB83975A0E1167
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0xA08569464A4BBB2C85AD7F7309CD1C24
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0x63004104864E617B59ADC3A2058F5C96
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0xE2684F3E21443D452E226F6B214FCB16
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x062E628A37BE5FFF70764B11D7BAF504
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0xBB4D147A41F862570511360029517236
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x2260513B462BB7C3FEB5C2D4B009E60D
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0xE1A2F07E9D0BF7E22B857B7FCA848C8A
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x23B2E3E0F229ACFFC1DBAD716DD1A68D
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x53C722E8E3912F9D10AAFD480DB02F34
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x0707AD9C4C42B80FAC3045EF9F8170E4
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0x00E892C332C1F8FD1373442D4557BF1F
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0x51A1A40016AA232CA270951D4024BA55
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x5F8C37AEBC6218683BD339C68639550A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is very well we took her in."
0x922E2BAA3CC32C18F880407BC03E80EE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xA8861251DAA41AA300EAC6B6F52DE496
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x90ACC9169F100B96AF20EFD38C9C0419

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0xD9F1ACDA075C709C447F0B3D0BED03D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x64930839E931F7DE785782C9B21E6E90
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x702C7B496D5C4B0F2532A18E43D20BE8
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x62C026D64469B8C2D317B9D0A6F9422A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x46605D62987F45E2FDE8F89193858154
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x6E0F7596F2F0974BB9A1DA87AD0267E6
would be agreeable."
0xC1CC146A399964CE2B9FD367A2600502

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xBD5D3B15582024530ADDD4B702569522
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xDB8A787F7B270A51868B7246BD8C46F6
myself.  I was comforted.
0x7198F808BC81095EA89CD3F8A41B4AA9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x92BFF3BC4CCF0F128D528137144AA80D
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x67D3259C700B2A44C4BEBBAC3A10C55A
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0xF73C3C6903744DFA98456EF53D9C7259
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xEE12116F84962A94C66AFA8FFF0D6528
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x2B3DC458F2679620ABEFB657B67110E3
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x1DE4EA16AAB728D3209FD3FE91FF9A38
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x31F3703078CBC12203ACCDB6E0BA7E02
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x0D972BAECCE98B05245FFD7F17D71042
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x0FA9C90CA540D03EBFDEB9DB31BE5691
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x60AE755FC1B8EB32DBD9EF4E65EF74CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0xEFC20F56A67A9311941C3413DEE74B50
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0x76CAE0A1F8F35AACE77D1BABE2AA0DFE
her permanently."
0x7768E2AB7DB4DDAD4D61F00A6C8BEFCC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x7CF81BD7F0C1B19941B1EB6C15E277B1
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xE78C96E247BD19109AD28434FAEA1B4D
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x667D9D065D787A094BE996A0EC682A39
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x743F06D8825EDD32BA3DC151A9159E05
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xDC10EBE7C038700B9D36491529EC758B
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x6AAC68301C1DA27925D33F27C4077F10

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x8D015DB21ADB36F78F4CF449EC81F10F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0xE1A41D57635012F96CD8FC39FB24A27E
are quite wanting in those features."
0x68472C9ABC5EF85ABA530BB582013F3E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xA3E59329E2868CD661DE7DEAEFE0A2F2
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x36FB9EAC0D806B64D7085F559737918D
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xC89E33269352DB597C5D0B8C5CE2A609
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0xDDBEBB16C4D5963C65A9ABAB304A562A
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x03B032F4C882CB7B04E65E8C9463B36E
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x330A311CC75FA7F80FFA004B23302A0A
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0xCDD6F233ABBE47CF3E1A11ADA767E290
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x5F14F51C2B0459D4966EDE67D498A12C
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x9AFC3D4FA40760746C77EF07B848352E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0xAA8B3C3606D46095B9D468DF8A0863B2
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0x9150BEF768E32E3E7E8C7694193FCB86
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xEC6F6F950ED5AA24E5691CED85868A56
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x71F6AC6A715A0D65B7EB7CB10C6C636E
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0xEA6206C55BDFC62CBC50569C4F57FADE
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xC6764E5CDF818CC8C065C098014B6B30
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x5B8B13C9AA6350DB9192BD5A7808629A
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x7F219C31080B3013E0218B97CACCFB4A
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0xA589EFC1980E0B66FE10358F8ECB9744
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x195B52B77ED460AD50A1E097A2D41C65
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xFF8F56B5E8E013FFC192DD26D3BFE358
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0xD5C017C319E5DA2E17C037A26C369653

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xAAD4298FD122BDA6E62A4BDE9D77A09C
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0xD199EFAA5D150CEE7856D470F86E440F
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x928FA38742D5DF36E3DFAAAF3A8191C9
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x25FC20A5CCADEF8E77152D4D20095EEC
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x8F9B3FC5D6A359CA2DC77DA5BCCD8676
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x7BA1F155A9917EA1096E64B78A77A0B5
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x138CDF8BB1C643CC308FFE1BF908F019

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x89233A6B62C86047E5681FE4E1A88EF6
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x74D203B288BA647CC38AF7204915B77B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x53D1C0D595A2BA8BFD25F83E32F66025
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x087DABE5101888A110B7B65EA531074C
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xD8183D209FC769498BC6C1063E326B41

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xB347D638059F57C18A40BA93C05A7EE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0xF7920D0D5B656EB8E6EFA7742D6B3ED0
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0x1C0EBFF73F9114C137C7659D2A66EB26
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0xCD90D17BB8F8F6221DA2B4EA4B878795

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xD84B4A321A41FCA24740C3A4595B23F5
than yourself or your young ladies."
0x287F54F160D472EC0C3650793F0DD1CB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x20AF2EF71B8711941034CDDB232E13F4
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x9CDE3904038A6765AC59E4B4B33B1489

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0xEE297CE1FBD458B4C21B430BE2589366
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x2FCDA36652F76070FFE4585BFDABC0F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x5F8D88607613F7AE5E25563D3845D36F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, very."
0xE62DC30621E73EA62A330C17056271D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0xC5F30CC8008145CD77755DFECEB1C9CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0xF763A8BD69EF5551845AD8E97DDDC08B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x1A0DA1D530A520A632D50A6B9A591398

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x1F68A611F1049C55F28F86C046DE7450
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x727235B064ABAA2E8E07D3FAEF051DAE
basket of the fruit.
0x01AD1305F7C959AFA4032FD439840724

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0xC61260AEAE67FDAF9EA82C443CE663DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0xBF9736B3864DE8F02C8BFA80871EEB4D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0xCBE92DB28A0A46BF28D5B885D3D96167

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x78ADA01B7FEB8D5367FE03DCDA805093

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x2E600FD4793A2F2A02615DCAFEA21BD8
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x40740E0BDA1E0852EE74EABF3098D5F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x9F9EE5581E5C0ED221254ECA286578A7
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0xF832309D3B4123699FF08DB08B55ED7D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xB6B95AB56403A9DC77C737B909C973D6
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x6E7A989DAEECEF96D4320A4F933A754C
are."
0x7C5C6F8813671615BAA073673BF9EB3D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x28C37FEBEC5F67D4C831ECEC1693DDD6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xD1FEADF8C5A5FABBBA6BF51A7DE84FB6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0xE0CEBF6478AA7B937AB7024B9C9605BE
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0xF68326A4003DDEF184314A257426CFAC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That village a few miles off?
0xA8C6F67AF62441C681B82CEDC463EC16

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Aye."
0x22DA38AA3BA7C835FA1817ECE5BABB3C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what is he?"
0xDF8B6513B07C1B5CA0395A6737FB9315

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x5A76D876D3A3A93AE527E6A594E25984
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's

0x264DDBC2229887375E804D7C77323EEF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Their father is dead?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0xDA83E827AD467F1F4AC19645B4934D58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x76741B42308EBF83D78EA1CECA9B5264

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xF7A874F957C9659D2E75A61E160C19D8
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x28B9F512AE9CAB0BEF62863403177796
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xD8BD524F28DEDFAAE93894607FE04C4A
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x14069B386A18AAC0557DB9210149A01D
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x55F9BCAEBC69057B2EAA474153E8BDE3
to consider poverty a crime."
0xFD75FF52431A24B742D9ACEC68DD0A52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x8CEC2CB982FF4B9F776CB7251B612AC4
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x54B4AA625BB211553570A74DD0CD5EEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xA1E62F257796FB502D0188820C262E97
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x628A358FA6525AE2B54FC88CA64B7E50
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x097B1D568966E4C6E571F5AFE3B6EDC9
the young people.
0xC448C378D7F1ABFE6D9989694902C8C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x2315C0CC9844F710481471E1E279E6EF
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0xDE5D502F3C7042665233EAFF3E9378DA
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0xBA378CED574E2288EFE4D32A55AD0E43
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x5E3DB6345EAEC8A5AA4C450948571DAF
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0xAB71CE46D7AFB09D19CCC5CA83F6848E
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x4D8169557364FE9A19A6BC23D2DB061B
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x151395920BE5C07696F37EB4C12CC5D0
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x5B22DA19E298D11FB54459544D1B4443
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x9A4036B54774A381A45ACB57606C4966
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x263D41053E286287460FA61B492B0FEC
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0x4D21C39841175FB37C1431DACC5EDB77
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x582D2CC792D042C7E1F91A0B3CFDEC87
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x4BE4BBA3BFBE86D355E75E7709F33247
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x6FAA86F36FB255B1ECB756A0E5C5ED6A
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0x5C7AEFA3D2F5098AD7ACFAB693458EB1
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0xE54E28CE952285C47D80711B4FCF4A12
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0xF23630B26B198D2D5F336041B903BAAD
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x4A61CD261A93C1287B3E24B1DB4C2FD6
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xDBFFBD77FA7E0983681F5F56F1F427AA
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x427D15960B94D8CE9B4EBE909DB6A59E
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x35DCEDD3D3FD633DF08F197E48F0FB84
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x3BD4E37013A7A03258AA65F47EBB3E75
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0xE3CC2946D4F15518261151CB0902A4B6
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xA103FEEA0FE502150BD1E589C0F3BEB3
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x1CEB65D00AE603F79358D0023FE35C48
for being united.
0xB6CB80EDFD57497DC4A83FD098821B88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x304635F99A8DEF5E6B841D8BEF48C82F
ladies and their brother were now.
0xCF06F51563DC6F17D3520AF30473D37E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x54AFEC22A211085566721B4D4BC5037D
to tea."
0x3558947427F7405FDEF50BBAC60C01FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x09070761A15C82CC4C9ED7D9CA6F9CCF
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0xB88C95FBE0B9F76535D8C55F503AC75A
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x6FA41D91C289A31C699AA63A656C5797
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xD18ADE426EC388A6E25C47A515E4E698
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0xCAC389884A26F3BD036627203A3E287D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xF643C1EDDA8670C2D14ED7829615E824
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x5055448C7E95D4C97CD56CDB7D77325C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x8F5D78B57A7C06D740F396B1FEEDDF61
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x6F05B2E2BB03D16FB950B0E4DF59B574
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x64D88DABBF8B7F905202D53BDE78C763
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0xFF4DE6CBC115901D697D901C94DD0073
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x0075A88107D4D0489D19CACF03D41D26
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0x99D984224235D9CF98A91ED80E83C278
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x201C80D0683BE17DE4A0EDE330B8A955
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0xC0911472B916C8794BC3AA8CFF8B6C94
will.
0x85D06560AD8A02D46A542059386D81E9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xD80EB29FEF5AFAFFAC1CFFAD0429BC93
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x5125C17839B54B5CFDAE587924BB30B6
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x2CE72EAAA94471D8F14C946F16EA9D54
parlour."
0x7280A0D0C1554D3C43078020F74877B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am very well here."
0xE0E69DD380AAF5BD598832D5F69FF4B8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0xF916CB4E5AF6C4CB8B364DE50F159E9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0xC32A573A133903535AF88F3554191CD4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x39745CFFBDD4B460EDE1EAB9B6FB9FCE
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xED0879CA7228A68834FBF3541F6D7B80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x4931A6A91AE0DCCE3F5707A5BA07FCFB
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x7F78CC89E7879905C592B9533F8F74DB
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0xA8E2234EE0A726B9701526FAF95A923A
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xB4CC5B39D259C1A99616A413D3F845DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0xDAAD7C61867F7011C81707FCD4E81ECD
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0xAF71263C340F2BE194C2BC1028208F10
parlour, and then its occupant.
0xBD464056A9F21ECA442B7E128A682F18

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x388259EA2E715B7FE2215B3BB82B5ACB
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0xD8563A5F96C034BF6593D347E3E8A76B
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0x9AD572DCD9ED7584FD7966D4C02CE71A
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0xFB939BB46B4C7B096495D7E13F3C2528
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x8D724E9783E85E0CD78AD62D67E8F111
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0xBB3D8799713B31DF5D39D038E52A0E7B
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x5C4C9CABAB4A9D2C67476E79946AE086
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0xF8AE18D051EDD5DDD6B619FD7B5CC5E8
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0xB3AE66AB1D86E88821B5BF33E868B690
and well saved.
0x1CBE94324A404B4784E3F8A1EACC1E6A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x4E2AA15EB2E9BD55F2D5EE27BC5E02B3
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xBA61CF609E45356DF6DD6A3A86BC30E5
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x0492E1926A39DA791D0AFF6D54AE0A93
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0xC91269A6A71EE6B3F0566F850475E668
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x3985D1523B02BBD509A5A38BAFAEB5FC
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0xC6721B2875E71B06D6793D011F5C2EFF
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0xF9F7F4FA58B058F4333899D04BC2E4F5
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0xCD544E04F072F79BF2BE77A5A82D8F93
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0xB2624062994C252574876681D84FE32C
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x7BA3AE2A7BAD9C23E889E609F8A2B864
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xA65FDAA9407002AC8CE19D8AAB5CCC08
fair hair.
0x5774B81840088800D5F14DEF97D74A01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0xEE5DE8116ABB2E1BF28BE00E6F81A764
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0x31F568CB3718A47D206EFF33F6D3BE3C
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0x02EDDF86FC37A1D7E7666B369001D4E2
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xBBC780FE962D867BA12AB0B8CD0265EF
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0xB7A9857785BC00678378EAE9B152F369
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x792D67FCB41CB4859589A82C739F35C4
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x82572B5519E89E8A47CEFA30EDCB5CEE
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x6C97D74ABBE405CDEAD0DC364F99D48E
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x65108E3EABE46E8FC2E80A6021AA5007

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x5ABB6A0D25CE1C7074E796E977A307BB
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x196453FE35A7548652306D4A7C2F2AA4
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x65EDEF09D8F3ECF7172CD98CFA1904E5
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x4FB2157AF208B362A62EA60FBF75BC03
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x4E8EA3F0C620A01E3D749A8A9ED1953D
from the stranger.
0x5D2FAAB30E0D70F5F161352467D545C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x585A97AA84CAA8815F720CFFC8C863F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xAD5E43A6C6C828736808758858AFFA1E
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0x48A668936AD65E4F447FC84887FECAF0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x0246D896C5D23808F91A2054C155C948
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x6CA9DD334A8401976EC4E7E3953F0699
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x70327BDBA554F60E152DCCC777CC98A8
immoderately."
0xB438EE05A727F98AFDFB2AACBC8972B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xAC38518FD82CEB87604692318534983F
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x118259039113C4B99A3091B0622E0EBB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x6E4343CFD47FE3E4ACDE0C811DA17045
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x7901BE34839403746400E93093B26C6C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0x808DA0C75DBACC07D9A33B656382DD85
absolutely without home and friends."
0x0A92E65F957B80DE4E74D2C4B973CD93

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x2424EB4B1CB2D60CFAD17AFFE7C61127
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xD2014354D82EA6611A5095B6D6832382
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x6D9BC4D5CE10482974526C42211E5F5C
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x0C1F4966B580DE50F407022526A2F9F5
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x47B00325F1C8D0F450A3414F5C590D59
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x8338EC87201DD5D73F5186C389D6FF0D
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x96E98E8749B6FA2FD4D0EDE538DB1D24
to encourage.
0xF9FA2C2EAEE9AFDE8768387F93EA0E9D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xD1C542ECEE876F659C190D28F810B81B
every connection?"
0x63357126A215EC06874DC21011FB0974

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x2A21C02D557CF7D2F8A08CD21B6B5023
to admittance under any roof in England."
0xC248FE2620056910702F234D64F44C37

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xA382F221482173BBBA24661F84BBFEC0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0xA3669B7855E8320CE4500B320BEF7A9F
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xDB2F5312BB918187253220F217BCEFA0
explained the quest.
0x2920A85D9F35D45B52E535D9F56FC385

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0xBCC08C52AD338F0031C8B5DA4F1B53DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x0A5C577CA5399015A01095B8802AF5C9
St. John," said she.
0x09747FF57E421B79C08BFD3E7A1BCECA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x9993D8A14A5A1277D45CE92B4DFE8AEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x1666160B12D87330ABB9BF97E1E640AD
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0xDD3B22847DF100877A24D8C908849E48
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x647CC90E41A6E1036184CAA5FEACDD1A
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x1760953B17E1993CA0BE96F98407C4A1
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x9B2045FB05AE9468AB93E24B9C9D895F
out tears as well as colour.
0x456E33486A8A4012BAE20C8ADCCD7CC4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0xE003D04975DD86B31D2DDFD3DA05FBBD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x740EBBF316E6C97F4315AE871F245A6D
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0xA064535B93B8D8DBE6626D109883E32B
piercing look.
0x1F223B0C66BFF86B2D28D13FDD5B965C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x5967A03B8A0560606D8CBE1FCBCD3390
secret," I replied concisely.
0x469321719734B236EA1B6EE8D827EB63

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xC856333B09FA90FEAF723D9C387E004E
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x98C0C0DDCDED7843F240825446E08D74

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0xF1AA01DD441BAA9808404E7839312222
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x2685BB948DCA5208B7BDD56254F319F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0xA8D3A1F7A48E979C51C7C3271D78E6E1
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x095992A08D48AD7E17622DD5A7D92B22
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x83E5FCB874C25EC5CCA505D07567E2AC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xB0320610AF2BDE04EE1F7908A4B6D6FA
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0x9671F3CBAF05DF3821EBBFA83789B130
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x0E2DE4F527CD0E17C9CCB7E745670EDE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x2222D494F3E11D0220F55C70C6EB264D
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xDBE8AF563DD11A730ED97AAC6CCF0398
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0xEE3856DCE5F41187D7597C74AEB57725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x2C7A57DE37E22195C77B234C82C87C4C
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0xC102E8C55C374B611AE7C5880D850116
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x003B66A218DD3ACC4AFDBBCF38538B34
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xFA33F0E1142B9B538D6B30488C5A928B
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0xC333222F4103A91CAA4671D64149D915
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0x029F7613BD308B24A18492E1BF085B54
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xD59423F5F894EF812965F533FDC546C9
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xAAB5B7776D36F3BF616FB5B5349DC24A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x387881909E4EF3E7768644286173B3E3
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x65DF8F401E4F7368E003C34DC6D4F34D
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x72F209DAC8979DCBC9A2BD9253624EC3
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0xAC371AF1BBE3F54622B4EC8BFEE0F034
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x799C3705EF36207124D08658630E2812
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x992C7E12076A98230AF0AF22B5BF49ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0xEF3656C6605A19E51EB188D02F0F851F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x3FA122A9E6242E2A62EF6E591DB47636
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0x591A045CF20472BF404AF798C5246F40
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x28CD331CAFA542335C7797E793CC4F0A
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0xF4BCAD3F8A84969B327B2CC84ADFAE9E
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xC0F879E1544A1F80AF22102E7C8A9178
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x39DD79FE09D1CA4DE81491A8D01EEC6B
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x0273604B974A9FF90D65AFBB3EDA4917
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0xE4545CAE08FAEAACC8DE35358587B46A
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0xF4D52ACF23232086F11B70866689C5F2
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x551248789F386FB619C1A2C065072F91
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xDC4A4D9CF4A07704E1AB687B4B635E89
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0xBED92511BC84BC580B9C0FE86D280705
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x1B2E7C8BDF9CF592D1D9BDAC1FA3B4CC
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x392865C408EBA5AD2DE8BDBFE8FBACF4
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0x8A3410BC045684015AF1B7C466B50899
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x0E73B2F0F4E3BBA2E33FCF0817E06493
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x3505B1F88D84A19D8F45A65739062891
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x068CDFBDA5BC11AD55E157D59ED9FA43
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0xC2F38307704328E3E1ED3B28B01685CC
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0xE776C11B649BA7D65DC354178504B94E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xD76AC31D9D2AF06DB2BA2849D64B3664
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x96704D3140C01508EA798CBB332FE5F3
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xBAE39A9657DDAC83E5B6B576100CE925

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x5757B404DB2252C591A02B13242ECB2C
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0xCA83BB049FC1914DE4C7200D3D2B0C11
once.
0x180D3B7AA88485E7FDBD64AD0F80FB70

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0xEF93A2597F051B55BB2F3DCFF5F60067

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x980B5866ADA027D59495C0F6680125E0
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xD17D705EC6B47BC831378B2BB22D30A9
sounds strange to me."
0xD1E3170CA3766154227182D1FAAB8D34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Your real name you will not give?"
0xB6BDCEC8025FA7ACD838602698E004E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0xD7B4CB35FFCBAFFB5E850FCD81A76530
lead to it, I avoid."
0xBB7C6B4AC3654D959CE557CFD65B1E0C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her

0xE5DEA816EC4CBC56541C3315A4BC0D6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0xE7A643602761CF32AF2EEAED2546FAB1
and with as much acumen as ever.
0xBC40EB9410D64529C724EC4F98AF2B36

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0xDDE21FF3C88AEA6194F879EDBD9265DF
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x081A2FB27B6497E0EF5F0D6999AF5215
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x9677CE475735177B0BD4813F1694B670
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of

us?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest

"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0x52EAEA6E0856B02D7A4BC086D95568A0
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x2B4FA5BEB9269DEAA9F10CAE54978B25
sincerity which seemed natural to her.

"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x8BD567ECE667D08C1496B5CD61D05129
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen

0x4E47BB4FFC1A0F4F49FCF1A5D055158A
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall

incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0xC02A111C8B0025465227E23991FE7A14
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0x3CDA40EEB4E7554D583E25CC7217C8F6
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."

"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x51650155D338564079210CDF0B0C15C8
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x76A8001A5FFF842EAE09E7D5179AB207
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xEB6CA14D48AC034BA626D96D84D5B91F
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xED19C41AA51FA487346D2CD2D888C083

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0xA69C9D6FC1A132AA996EF2AD4486C3C4
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0xC69464E48E106BDA07D37BD68305FD35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x85E6369A1734E95CEF7A9B015A77F594
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x0CFBDD439A5501074141A56EE3AB48C4
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x301459BCD344704531BC1379C7AB685D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0xCF0771CE843FE1FD43525D7193E0D3B3
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x5B70364B23F09D7AA06894130D103449
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xE704B43E13B04FF4FE76E1F4EAE1F16B
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0xFAABA3AA9EC6AA0FE757C6C57F6A0559
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x147AF662860BBD721D0F97F2D279AF25
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0x20B8319A9D86971D5AE5B4E2D27363BD
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x2F88FBA0363F67A9056DBE2A26C18C30

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x00EED42FF0F3E1609C8A0D6D57E98162
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0xC0C515F94914D71FA43E5BAEB021B38C
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0x32F2D5AD15A750443903CE71EF12C824
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0xD3B23C7AB8E9D51714A72EE7B7A9264F
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x7BC52F02A0B0BA733E713639D6D9727E
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0x6F8E5677B7EE73B05034DE2C764218FC
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x6FB9A07E1007C4FE566D83405525C43C
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0xD2B73125708E9C5CEBD66049D9987BB8
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x758E872ADE1684B231CAAC1688D8EA1E
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0xCE9CBA68A14F601644CAC5605DA64D14
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x342E1BB41C8C52C1B4635FD46ECF319D
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x91CD54673EA1C3BAE31BFE5FE587365A
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0x4DFE173DC3F03853600F25DA01C4ACAE
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0xC4B152A380548B592BADA094E7FC4D5E
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x0AE3E48E2FBE12B49881A71BD90EECDD
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x66AC6F825197121534AA77F69732C30C
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0xD5BE6D8F2B1CEACCD7B356A3395FE822
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x6B1829F5A5C716AEAD4D5F5D7BC670FB
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x83E1BF99B22E9E32A7BED4B4BB7712FC
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0xE43B810E5A4118078CC8CCDB402EFDBB
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0xCD6BE8C5E8347E2F748EBF0106D40F48
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x417CDE48258FBC97DCF43894A371FEDE
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xF84C8ECA64BF239584B691F71ED144B5
that entranced theirs.
0x7C0EC2BEDA5D1A72F1D1763E232C2E2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x4BFA1897341C1F692BDF54B19CB46DF5
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xE8F01A9680FC34ABB524305EA7D6E2B5
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0xC4C84CFA0518614480C5A333325FFF82
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x354607A9286DDA7FF215AC3F01441382
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x5145E347222FD6CA577464BF0A3A9D11
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xEB0FD0E6DC4C072CEA7E97E3EBE4C513

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x50F1683CBC543AE381CE48CED74E7130
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0xCDF86F8077BE184033F49F273A0A6F6A
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xE6C8569469F86B391937528B2420D74A
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x1671FCE44FBE8C45A22D56C5A2704FA4
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x35473EA0D76067571B93EF3BA211FD8D
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x2D8BE4CC3851F5962D46F840036168E1
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x412C37131E128F063B0FE96D8858A5D1
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x9CF939BA9CDD2C1AE8D13C05374B388A
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0x366AF6E5FC69C1114674108C6D2286E5
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x1D149D3C630EEBEBE6C653696D193615
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x43A34890E426EA99B0EF25BD5791C32B
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x11720C92EAE27F3E3C90171256C25160
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x6D3E342B06815BBE2566E4FA15963DF3
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0xEAF0501F237652B6531FC014A2FF29FF
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0x020A3FB9FFC1B8F57D849AEE27B01465
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0x814D1A6C5879E7338D28C422E82A695F
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xF5B860C4553A6C9F04C9FAA9C69BD093

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xEA9744A7583B4835BD5B6FD1E748E577
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x9716EBDAD024B4F5289EF4D03C476ED6
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x24A81E36A8861B7B880A28A5D7AA6C0B
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x4C7A8CD4722C5ECF8366378CE516CD3D
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0xBAFF35E204CDAC962B59B564BFED1BA7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x97BD5449418F17162C8C5E9943092323
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x39D18F8A38942A2F1040BF57654C6035
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0xB8AD5BC81F37CA76CA90CF2F6FA803EE
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x82DF65636F2D9AD4CD55B2B49220F16E
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x0EEE022287E041E27836DBB1AB472700
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0xBB95F62F3C451FBD3781B0B3F6177E02
cheerful--
0xB148F6E4D868D34FDB99A0A34E2DC04F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x3974B273A264C90B2F1AAC7357D423F8
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x5EA38211EAF76E3435619472C902C84B
propose to myself?"
0x3819CE13EE37AF859E04155B569A442A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0xBA9A043ED51A9D72616E49C2FC584AB7
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xBB61DC1AE78BFDE0543A344035F2DE24

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x6C8E363B44D921ED7EA1670CBCC4C3CE
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x6C730DF93EAD87DE9447DE58C960DA8F
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x65DF890F335F365885410ED26C6ACDF3
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x71542BB1A1BAEEBE1FB662D8BF662866
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0xF861C0155C554F37AA078C5CCAE29D33
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x165958ACEC262E7F347240555402E552
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x752427C2EE516F24A55F740195B8EA72
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0x1CA0DCD6D441E9E0B81ECA03BCD1163D
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0xEE881CAD31531AAD21F0149408BC5946
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x3A13E6349553305292C85945F56423D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xD00B0E06D4AFB467CB0FC125B059C837
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x8F2C043228696EC194CFA666D9AC6EC9
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0xE3543B20052D37A6A36EAE63F9DF8ABF
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x183EA978864854E0CA7B78150BBC2495
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x345455C90C1D330441A267FA26FF31D2
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0xFA2A885E83350A6B0F0EE26673FF6759
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0xF6649CDC05BCCB0D18514D86A4070BA5
delights they could yield.
0x357CDC4030C2D5BCD968EB13A3AC63DD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x1981119F77C9391C1E41D74F8E438B0E
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0xF2EC50195E75EB0DD181C3D870AE4FC8
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0x640975526002F32DB6C9CE9CF6A0CA84
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x1C08AF8C336F39CD7051997671275469
produced on me.
0x8F1962EBFB0D9F4AEFAE03CFC5A00AF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x93178AC345AB5940A7E55B7025C1ABEE
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x9793FDFA3EA8A9FB0844ED4CD4D9F05D
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x81D36AA28D12549EFA639133391DAE0B
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x804A17DDCA854FEB15B5F2407E188FD7
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x62A166AFE1BA1A759CDFDB96FEB11B3E
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x6ABCFD609CAF1BE192CD3DB94B4346EF
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x017B7F4B10206FE6CAA3FB87612DA487
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x3314E216287183B5D9C5C47F0FF0D4C8
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xAD30A013ACB1111A3F54B73F5DD9906D
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x0F7526ADDAFA161E9344D825EA0DB3CE
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0xAF319C3C062C186A6F794FDA5A7705DF
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x478BE33FAD296439598D1773F250E632
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x05F5B2C57B4008954DF5C9B23005B4AA
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x3F3CBC398F5D4284D3A1A1BC45C03E3F
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0x92BCC48C19318E057870DDEEEE95A89E
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x15B2779418A7F47D4816453829EC4D38
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x150B3BF654C68A62E459293F44422FAA
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xBE905DB021C567B1C61A2B080CE226F5
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0x1965CAD627CB7282F2A0BA5CFF51A542
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0xFD48422B7A449BED49FD67AEC2FC2D4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0xFD0B488FBD325F97928E6C4A1CF9DC14
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x2A753CD8E76BB2E08932B0FD2D87BB08
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x02C40847E3DFBE5B026208B9352133B8
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x952F4275C72BF3CBF1DF2113178986CF
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x1DF3082FED04EDE63AA680178873DB56
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0xD0E94BA364B742C228BA02D460B39991
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x6CC913A831501BE3F2CB4DE21F5E7F24
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x0F7D4A2F374E9E79E040A3123DC59C9F
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x3A97FCB40E7EF876CFD638E74DA9FD86
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xAB21620749EAC85F4F014CEB33C41C4C
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0xB243AF625183742F82818A4EA2917917
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x77C10A12629D1FF430206864836BF97F
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0xC0BB572BAC358F6A70D8CC83797358E1
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x3D6D758F77D62F4AEFE6640F408F5583
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x4143BBA308184EBC001C8C811C70FCDE
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0x99A31F9E376EFF5342F27C28C708EAAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x94EC09756FE9F706DA67E4A14079251F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x6008914CF03EDDB28C2CCA456A76A308
myself to undertake?"
0x31160E7C05E55C60D8E8693C823AEB6E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0xA6E8482DBD70D52B66FDE16234238A63
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x15E4F3D1E4197CEBC3B64B822DCC1573
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x39CDE8F587DBF040EE3589BE8142C0CC
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x530BB90E703F4D1A0496D2BBF5E00DC4
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x5CD3ADFB2F2D1386B53927A2B3DDED4C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x19FE1E1F24D51790C7E573DEDD15F8C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x66B1EA3F03DA03417E9749A272AB4E31
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x4B577D8E7B3DC0B619CF19457B1E5E3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x2C5FA0AA7C918C904696A4287C201682
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x2835B0CB27047FDB73698031941FEB50
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x0B19AB4830B0D1EB8C744A14E3981F85
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xB41359A19A157B5FB0BB1CDA6757A979
interest to me.
0x1C6860029E04E49FF0FD517A55C3522A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x3E08409F784E1D45BD43179F8C14F85F
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0xBE08416EC6B43024DF598C3376360FE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x8848E767CF634D535046CA62BAE922BE
you to accept."
0xEE3950D8A1AE5C5462F9BFAD521D6CD9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x187F26165CA8DBA040E7D4D466D38088
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xA78C22A28DD3928F9FB65FE5692A051A
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x40F83ADA9A9F5498E7A6999ED02BDF6A
could have done, and with less trouble.
0xB4BA9C2D44F65442D32FEB46D4314CE5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xD49F7434AB1ED07611E3F2B9309F9C7C
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x56CE06B72DCC9387B25D41C9A8DDF806
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0xBB2FE05110EE227C25B2C6344D146622
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xA8A2BDE51DB7146BAF76B3DCB44CB7A9
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x95BE43303F6FDC89B8549FCACD7B0BDF
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x1C53929064CC16859496E4D6B7F68140
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0xD600F7D6346EB390CDFEE414B7154ED0
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0xE07A2A94B135CD6CFFE4FC5070878BA5
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0xCD6A2BF07E95B6FD334C7AF33A56B152
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x59CC4C0D3D9A5916EF27A7589C4170BF
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x15B65A61C560F60A5C601EE9F0D2E0C5
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x8735AC021062050540D3B670363B5770
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x0006834BC299D06F7D7D61E5F420192B
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x07539775CB9A040276336D38FC11B9F2
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x10D0D3B6C61D990A2D35E586DB128A47

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x3ACA8C5BB056C322EB4F074B17C531A6
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0x3096A554650189D3D15048EC99AE50C0
glance.  He resumed--
0xACF52ECBAF926F0391B5D09198D339A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x78BBC7792916BBFA7A0BF89E98A4CBFC
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x648685CB47630E4B274BDCD63E1A43E9
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0xA35F67AE08C77D5455093BD6092A606A
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x9680F1BE5CE3435BC53671B07521191B
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x3443EF21753F129F7CE9DE5B2ED960B9
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x07835D2E29828705F55EFDB0626D1D0E
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x338011D5B1996144831B7E74986DFBA9
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x5694CB15F7AC9C015CF329D472BEBE66
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x7E4BFD2F2135FB3138EA4B748CC2E378
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xD97E3188E841D7CCA12B7C8495DCE8A2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x0A6E8AB41A092EE27BE791D0BDE08064

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x4D24A5D19EC3AB36E27A3A5A3ABCD08B
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x72FDB99EDA4CF120FE609529E8F4FA89
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x0D836671AAD806D231F8FAC5C3F31994
succeeding observations.
0x2A2A113B14AAF703669AF31707F5BB0D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x704642B5EC9EE33BAF0B9F73FC447AA1
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x194E89790F5B2D2C105F4AEC2920BC21
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0x280E5290FE5A1D58176512537EF6DC6E
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x7C336F1EDDC04F922554F362A858B035
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x3853D4A8A91AA973C2534059EAD28B89

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xE323F7A9F0F39DEF7AFF817AAE18CFF2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x6527FEAEDB405677A603B2939B88C1A6
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x1AD1EEFB508870A1DCA5FEC2E489C948
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x7F4F535B89DC653E1685E9F6FC451FD9
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0x2792B9A2E18E5026AD787325BEF98FB8
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x5CD12A862FA88C47AC1C28FDDE166B12
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x2B22858B2F1191C3660D9855D7C5E27D
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x5EFDCCC0F0B481B1092572829ACF0EE8
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x964E4EBFA1EFAEC5C64159E0CEB4224C
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xA2158915A65296C24A909EACB785AB2D
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0xF93FCDE8AC5C17B1154BC240720F4C48
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xC0188A1DF9FBE6CD4DA7E325FB7C7EFC
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x56586F68F0BCDA67BD576134453DA689
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x15658CF0050CF7515B0F028D17243870
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0xB253DF2B06D2986898F596F65AE4A9E3
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xA4C3F8CC182569A3EBDD3CC822DA944D
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x3AFB8E35C55018628083FBD7F013C2D4
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xD2DE3FE1EF600A572D3ECBF6495800B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x5C8BB10EF995CF01C5BCF2289C02FA9B
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xFACB42877D56688970D26E3E52B898A4
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0xA31930F3286A187CFB89D8086971487E
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x43F61E223C8CC497541EE16C057D1CD2
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0x6D55DF72C2F2431327572EBFA3207571
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xCDAB184358A95209D5EA5A7FF008B5C1
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0xBB9072280BB1521D210C1961FDCF1EDA
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xF544820A972697A23903C35AA36E9E0E
decision.
0xF1EE24D26CECE99F8A4079E8FC975D01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x27D31F2A66BA9910E1B94ACA9A770B23
heart."
0xF3483FD8C18FBBDFEAEB4648C2A3E11B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x7ECE093F7063D785AD926CCB21012431
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0xF389636F927B9896F3820F9B703FF079
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0xD8ECB6F85E9BA349ADB903A6217F68C9
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x50D98ECBC3504876238A5915D6DEA618
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x78B577D397AB59248CA5FBBAE13C2AE6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0xCD1874C1F4A826E274FEA7B9F77BA41A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0xC46EA46751A17BB6DD27D39F01F58482

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do."
0x074B841801B1C78AC40AA2FDACCC3DEB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0x6744409EC9AE8D0372315A57D84DEDB7
deeply gratified.
0x53B0DBA2701F296E7EC6C6AE4B684F7C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0xE377334EB1B9342C70338AB56FC18F21

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x6166B913025249CEBB6B65AE0393C8B9
week."
0x1D6ED1A1BF2A6BB17B62F0FDC8473416

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very well: so be it."
0xB8DCA04E0013EBB48A6CC0CC2A5A379C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x05A0D051A4E367A298F6B3A2591B5481
me.  He shook his head.
0x64A76156AEDD5CE7FE61453EE5443471

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x81190FC664CBC3B30860C5AF57CE3DCA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x9F0F3C6157F459B4182E30463C9F2F99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0xB0CD31B131249CAD23B4D706352AB443

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x6CD2C2F590084DAB61AD0F28CD10FC2B
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x41E4BA0F28FBA63A4E7A5D11120D5C3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am not ambitious."
0xEB2A25595A3C504B25FD5465A591D071

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0xA7A57DDEFBF90E7B816173EDB65F3DC7
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0xDCF1E826F494616237152C17D5E35CC7
it out?"
0x996AC4741D155A6A84C8480B14AF5D24

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was speaking of myself."
0x95C8914177E9EE0C2DEE13A9A571B43B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x7A0AA4AAEBA06CFF06BD3D969032696E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What?"
0x3D6C1398D2161461D457A47CAF6419E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x953B5BF051BB3F9D1E75165A43391C81
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0x8E93D6223611528CF19063BCBAF4D361
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x83EFC369A0760D0A00DD09804A82B538
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0xAFA71D84AC4E6E4B50F15DB2EF44F5C6
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x70974E370FFA9B0B8B205813804A605C
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x4DDBE5A46E7540C4D12F181D5A5D364A
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x711038D7077859DAE5AF9AAA0DD1879C
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0xCF3E61D124273E507BE7573967F8C804
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xC5F59FC98B3614D01B0E28E8FDD93A7F
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x99F3904672074D1294A63EC424FA43D9
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xDA43DC9AF794D6120EADFF0F357212D5
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0xA3564ECA8A0B66A28C8D4D52580040D6
some means."
0xA88BFBF4812A010797FD60F910FED3BC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x7510FB246955586D340A681413E36E26
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x15B34BA36725C4177B508D4378EC05E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x797FD4ABC8BB9F9756EF7E70930DF381
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x015C07185C786593D037506431EC8B63
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x28E09E430EBD3359CDEF320D9E2B0686
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x6871E150D4DA3661D13FDF66097140F8
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0xDA25AA953CA65BBD7DC82DEFB9C89287
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xD2868166C0CDE778CCA6878C034A8421

"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x78845876F77DEA170507C6339F84354E
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0xD9D94E6BEEE9CEFD4126E13E10F41E47
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xE39B3AC5385744B01D2A666A3A2116A5
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0xC429E2283C64B0D4E024FB41035642F6
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x7D425EA5194B6EA308A921F038F50729
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0xA5F2499C53310074B4146F7E90306862
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x20688D166635E25FCA17F9EDE05550DF
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xFDD0958DF04943479C1E35D957C06844

"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0x5707336AB40D20C51C1935205F2BCD12
she murmured.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x207C12ACDF71681F743D4E6688ABFF44
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0x52B07263C072F13F5089B93CF7A8A426
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x02782F282A93169B233401EF4C596F4A
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x1E5F335A11ABC1624176954BC84FF2A2
letter.  He entered.
0x8A2AF0D544EDAFB05B7668A7CD48B93F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x90CE7AC892C0AAB613A518413A220853
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x7F3A6D65F8357107EA717234E1071D99

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x8AEC7A060A28234C8F89A5FC51CE72FF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xC0CF1ED47C8FFCBC27745E76B3BA572F
demanded, in a low voice.
0xCF6837166172B1B730FDA0D96B31B821

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x3D27D02B2FC54F9D719D47DB7824C8E5
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0xD94110B60E7655857CD2765933B52581

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x5946FDD9EC35273DA4E003C95E3B1FAF
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0x71B1F0EDB75B18A38F8DC7EC29DEE11A
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x99B25C19E8EF20DAD0423A522520497A
enough.
0x69686774AC203FD33F9AA105505DA558

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x426CA21C3B0B4AE93B76E9BB321AEB5E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0xF3514FBAE954E591B78FD4A2DA1888AD
Mary.
0x5889B5991633CD4AC66475959F72BA5C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0x684E56AFE71EC9426CB6C5E4A2838626
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0xB8EAB55F1153BAC212FD59318E877A8B
what _is_."
0x641C690C741EAB3B06D4A0C001B308D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x87899DE9A1AF101863566596C43248EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xB52184BA1A582FF1AAB59EC943BD0C80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x350FD888A570F31DF1231DD5F65D5E83
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0xA0DF7C9B3B684EDAE3C63FCFF36A12ED
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x7B76ECBDA927D1ABFEF29CF51DC3F394
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x591467D9C8D21EECD5412D2E10AEFABF
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0xAC16E5C8360FECFD231191408BBF1301
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xDEA5C76E3B497916E89BE5CA5CC7025F
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x8F0932BF689ECA4E174BCD5EDC792105
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x7189BFAB345D48C309BF21CF79FA9E3C
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0x9FA7C2023284B9DE147D2D2BCE410A0E
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x31FA054341A4014DBCFFAE25FCD3EB89
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x1174938A4BEEDB432CCEB1C850215323
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x4D701C314E08EC4D71935E1D6EC2D60B
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0xFAE81E2F5ED005C7DEDAB2E2F8FB81F8
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0xB6D9633ECD8C4CE16B94434420DACE88
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0xBDE7C8E475F034F73CEE6B6EC966D69D
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0xDD79CE90EFDEFFE5950C10BB95B10D16
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0xDC99846EA189A81D53F06BE49E2CAAF3
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x85E2DEEC75A087BBC1713D6962776DA8
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x14EA69F96B6DACC7A7987D48159A312A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x4EF971B4D8D013C5B0F9D8EB6B671879
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xF54A36DC67F542C64E5D3270244CA718
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xADDEDAA002649C20730082204CD8DC31
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x579B3E3E74226F56EF01F4F7BECE1CAA
and so the old grange was abandoned.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0xDA92D70691A142BBECCC4CFCCDA59CD6
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x2E1E18912DEDA7E1D1E7FB0A84ABB91D
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x86645B792B25D9DEFC39AF4545329F29
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x9EE5340632827EA588AB65624585D67D
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0xE8E3FB9A9E0DA58E123B1AE2BE8CC3B1
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x31E3EB705038A964C58CDF2047C3F427
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0xD34F625E82526118CC80F3F9C4AE6BEE
things as are necessary.
0x71D921E35148C851AD8B92279DCB31AF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0xD0E243C4449FD69844546492BBCECBF1
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x8F8FA355D622E6AB43C2196AA79CB8F2
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0xB680CF68BA0451B448F482705A77DF97
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x25979172552C86FAF82A3B9ACBAF4B2A
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0xE28E878AC8AE74B3C99AE7E2DDA1BCB6
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x63E09F69F2EE1B1483400A222E2EB78B
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0x0A97BC63F29D8FC9662550922D813F90
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x3E3B04D7AC1DE2B783D1A714C712EFFB
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x505133B090280B4DACF2385D7D379EDD
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0xEBEDBEA54DCFAF763CBDFCB575C492EC
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0x11F333759E04DB114D1BEFE204A01ECC
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x41A3A286A72408CAE8BEF85D076624B2
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x9AFD353C756A6FF1D5ECFF2DE7844CE5
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0xA69745CBDEB8777B37ED27168E592E06
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xD9AE3EA0327DC977E2583EEA29E63359
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0xA3D8CC53B7F251BB53B8E2445BCE5323
on from day to day.
0xB5935C83F0551CA417587099CD3F0E53

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xE5B5625E4D9F8C8059422C818C1C40A8
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x7A443C7C47E21EA0349BBA9452F56795
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x9F5B02A2EB38DC8E5C9B5271A233AB55
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0xD463A0A34964B6B70CCE3C4A1ECADBF3
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x4DEED327E199DB5D3C41A57CF79BB627
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0xF7DFC7DE2312ACA384D70F4CAA684891
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xD58B68243BD51C54F7771B56CFB677C7
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0xF7ED9E4F9DA639718550F667DC5C8CF1
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x7A1B1AC4EF6090A14B0841F328FAF079
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0xB1CC6A9D8D441C2AE9E5E66CF0478C02
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xB29AE136CA912E1BF89731DCE8DD25BD
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xE0F5E4A0F1018CD4E58FC2C9A0D2086E
gratification for disgust.
0xB9AB0D6AB43BB3634A1EC3567E5A49A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0x5BACD1D9570D3CCC98ED31C344B26ED1
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0x5C38E22D90DF6FE5C9C46A97503BB930
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x4072DD601D378F73F816EBBC4581572F
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x191D0713BA902C2FE9860394505E7321
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x3FA3397F606D11775FC87535A41ABAD3
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xCFABFCA6B9C9028E4A52AA781A6EDE1C
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x27EB9694E61DB27E6B922F7F8C95E4AF
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0xB19477EAF27A742E66ED28AF7DCA7BC9
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xD64A1AD80F348F03333E174EAD0252A6
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x69D3FBC83FA2ADA5489DE909C4CB49AB
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0xB342E5DBABB3B5D33EFFD0900D404551
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x0E4D7E5222C268D9E64B43F16C128E4E
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0xE5B58B7A135D0DDB100E88E106A844B1
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x74EC9451B738AC7F971AEBE360EC023C
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0xF25848EF1315F20C638B7FC9CA2F95D1
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0xE86F523759CF43E17C30FD7E1607FC35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x3FDE6FD1131B46CC1DFEB26456366CBD
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0xA4038B128BCD27FDCCEC257B652F8222
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0xBD522E02561B19D522D44C8F50D6EACB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x0126C21969900E130372E4659EC63D2C
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xFF123B2846B9F65672121A1235D35F4E
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x5868E142256924F5CF6E601289E31ED8
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x04F812FE9C2F5D41ED611DA442D47756

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x8EAB14E36D6394FC8ABC57D2FDEB3751

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x25537E83ECFBEBE3BFED9823566947D0
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0xC4E4CA19B09DC49F3904CA04A3D2D2A9
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0x5AE41E1F8672A49C6AAC681311F95B49
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x10B8B66D025DF738E1301CADEEBCFB48
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x61A731F3A9D93447E6975CB0C0D53DB1
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x7966806BC5EF62CADF3852D6EE635772
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x21E467F588868613F0053C8CDBF6E6A3
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xB07885CCCAD95DE6D7EE08020CCE0B75
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x3EB96E784988A5A2D49FD5EBCD5F2E17
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0xD897EB82A0221D95693B4BFE232A6E92
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x3661C20E2C61C5E2A8AEE005B3E4F313
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x98A9C346B3AD73B645AB12955C4976C9
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0xE8369FDE08CAAF5D972990805CF0A335
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0x50AC40B72CD84833861022AF2DB91803
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x23AF99FE2B62BCCCC5F57E5C6922F91D
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x3D8CF6CD6BC56C9162B3A753942EA44E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x0BB17A9F603211CD473E34695CCF5F6E
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0xF8E06A1C8DFA56C6DCDDC82DB29594B2
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0xABF6737D6BABD0E6B66F072A27CA9C4D
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x8E919374488E74EA9746B896F5AF0D9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0xB57DAB38C3DDDCDF0B4E068581A9964B
asked.
0xF6E8A7C881BCEF07EF1844385A4C9165

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x008E524F86467A459A0391875F32B936
scholars very well."
0x31390D301CD88AC824B86BFF60A3A087

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x987669D5F2ADE32D60DB08CC42FD976E
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x394905F2CC12F3636A9EBA3C087000F3
I interrupted--
0x381F896FC777A5856A8C3F719724FF7D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0xBC4081B395C8B7D6775337003F1E45E5
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x307F03FC73FBD251DE3A8CFDDF3F9D8F
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0xF1C8D4FA92EF823D544F1A869372AA02
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0xE6FCEC883DBF49CCCCEE50654CA286A8
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xA6918F76E7F46138664972CBEDA96B4B
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x6C2389BFC8259D67924F57589D89DCDD
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x1058E3499D3D8665D7671AB2253FD1DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x19C217DBEE1F9ED2F34050C633B16AAC
is dark and empty."
0x02B86C66D3AA11D168B813884A944183

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x989221248BE2249468A6A8D4532521BB
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0xC44C49CFFAEE79D07E64AB7B44823D63

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x51E5DCA4216E9663C5A2BC0B56339229
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0xBCC09D2E74013A3BD7BFC3BD5837AF54
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x1A6FA16A9438B6D837CD2A0D933E6F38
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x00FAA68304276B959108BD43A23125CE
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x247ED8C4BEDA17270F9E102376C3896B
steadily, for some months at least."
0x2ECAB1B46A3B08B1044A13135F5C911E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x75E88300DF03B573C8E7BE83C8A6DDB4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x15F576267C5C70FF8997264CDF866714
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0x0D183F1BEF4C6F933EA35543EE10588A
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x40E5BABB3AD390EA183E5E2CE9517B74
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0x605217CA9AB61746030D653D075F5EE5
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x5578889919AFC6B00509DEA492D99897
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0x30E8A8467E974BA4E13A1C1D358A40F3
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x0ED0303066CC5DB06E86B9DD9958655E
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x718394E18B8347A6A431C74F277DD4CF
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x4F412125878E43893283B5F5D4533F99
rougher than it.
0x198FC41B47ACE5453CE777BBB0B4DB51

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x881DBE0454FA972371DCE8E35AF98BBD
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xE837007F9A81F36A82ACEBEC0E254844
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0xB18B3AD237B02662E66104874D5107AA
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x878B3CB6B1783E9D2E87ECE2B27DE173
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x3E501A36BC790F4B842E8F36205F22C4
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x186816CCA522B816C44C5B65F54F518A
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xF98FD812DF27A502403317C9D0DBADD9
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x95F3DF37E3B10F853F86FA72DFD70559
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x287B0523A91848D2F3591C472998A505
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x0E74D85120BFEFE510743E8FC59ADF19
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xACF23DE15F384E1DF18B36FE516E01F1
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x98585D1D34CAD314A872556E87AF812D
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x2FF9DA9B46B1786C1CBDEC37960B2084
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x1747D7E1B6FCC12C867027DCB7E46109
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x6CE5C48F4B74633B334EA12E098B0DEB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0xE08E3BF4A7E071DE9A29F1F2A7460615
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0xA4A4C4284215B4AF7F55F76C8AA1B4B6
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0xC7A7B9FB61A8684CBEEDB9E4905AFC39
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0xC50AE8047C0D13DCD6CE496A5EA1F387
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x11C82BB9BC8C395AC0F575BE78CC7AB3
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x771317A267F60AF5CE1A6DDAAEDC1A47
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x2716F4187B7B99A9E1F2BD8382C8460A
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xDD169A1905F97E7B6285DD39F3F04999
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0xBE653F90637C6F5E819B0035B059CB8A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x960B257CD214FBB86685212339570A41
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x3469E39DED96FF4D122FA8376DC5F4DA
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0xA5A83E0F3F15C4F34F976E24A1621962
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x3290F1668073B9DAAFA60D70D4165A11
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0x7551370A460CC808832C141F19028027
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x040539907349B037AF8290B2B126CDB9
exclaimed--
0x18CA1D4C3FC69FECE07D552987486574

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x5272503C7282C41617E7BBA3E3EBE54E
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0xE3199B05827FF58A465F18B9FB59F9BB
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0x843050143BB9BB38F2D25A1075719202
your back towards me now."
0x68298CFB9F3726343746909AB29DD461

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x830378CC19FCA29D8AE7B4327E91CB2A
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0x42ACF41B779ED0BCDE65808119933F59
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0xAD69E4A0CFC28AC6C27871B37A074145
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x95A31FC90B85C94E781CE4ABB65D44AE
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x38D5D2F9E963BDC9D68682B3AAF8EEE6
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xF2307D8F188D171B9F2D7AFCB018042D
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0xDB98F959E4D8AFDA76D8CA3EC34465D2
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x44D44A2C57AAF07502BF37E80736D64C
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x3DE490E221E29CD066C52E7DD9BC824C
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x47E2EE55B29EF2588BFCF859D155CA6D
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x328344E31A32A04DF4E2462B2D37B661
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0x787248DC078D672D24C7403281FF3FA4
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x9B6679A4C9365EFC9AD6260E22988E2C
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0x63BECD3E75D7EA69F031EC76E592657C
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x357EFDE480B3AF1DF9038BB20DBA3225
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0xDF1DA53C772FAFE46249AF14C841C116
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0xAD99072DA84312CC20AA71C7206543CB
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x9CDF6940236183623DC78A1922A7D104
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x70C04A400E0C5CF0065BDA5FD4515808
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0xEB53E332662906D7B0C9152AE6B45CEF
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x8335F86276099823E3B7D37DC079BDAA
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x878750AD6DA6799160384684CFA4D5E2
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0xCE6CFC521FDBCA7D727C24D32BA2262C
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x89ED526A918ED3C2A6F17D9A25FC54F0
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x2CBA13B45D7FAA038892EF82E9B3D7E1
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0xC56B46C2504644E9D7F1CE95BDA7C96E
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0x53CF07CAF30B1FEE4C729AB22D21C441

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0xDBCE40734D0EC14456C49D5A1CBEB09D
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x179D03773107979332F0DA111A13FC99
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x0F69D10292EDF78A388017E3C7A17DD9
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x6AB8FFDB4FECA6A72752F66D8090F0B1
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0xC3F3BFDDEC96C865004CF35BE862B26A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x717554912EACDE0F38DD212C27F8E9E3
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x4989C1E67E6F381243CCC08DBC69A9F5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0x839A7287CCE8C86D438A40C7E1266EC3
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0xDDAF5548C4B1F7713DAA8C92BF9971F8
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0xE2D95C856E991643972F71E2562B82A8
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x2F6CACE7F00EAEE49A13C8D392922472
pointing to me.
0x3221AA239FE7412559E3C1C95146D02B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is," said St. John.
0xA34C3DA6DAA36B09D709EF1E4604F5EA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0xE9B4EDEDC7DF5263C60D8BC7CFB6B590
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x746E804E8A96ABDFF799FD12C83CE407

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x9D53F64CD27DE864FF4B0DEF4326518D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x74D8C7BF812FDA9086E881CBBCA94CC6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Quite."
0x4E98AC7526E37CAB0DC8720CBF93CF3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you like your house?"
0xD0F1F3B1111782CCAD14A3B9F8856C32

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very much."
0x3C6D63EF3FE42A63D18A8C0B68F4286B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x23368BD01DA0B3B92ECA57981D9F9C49

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x9358668CD21EA94FAE13C66F6339DCA8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x9C7E6E0E3A749834B7B8CE37386DAD3A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x53B38A6749C59A67D564B4D7A25A828C
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x3CD966031578EC9C83055398178AFC6D
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x05C12D90DFE7CA65A5F588FAC696820A
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x438B0459CE0E2F4EFA3C51DAD0690309

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0x9B5B96E883C609AA482EF157E1B45CCF
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x9945CD02CF498A13F2BA59CEBEC2EAE3
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0x0C67BA1FD11640E2A70E09A0072C29C3
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0xFC81C79215655010F4826D46C11698A3
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xB8F9230240FF9AEC5DDFA773F8E76421
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x2967A7C6CB288126EDD96DCC8E293481
merchants to shame."
0xF6377CFFF0CE8C7A2886070B03D24423

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0xED854AF8CFA1A64430032CD39AAD936A
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x39D1D518B304D3D881C9FF6D68FA4191
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0x6041D29D603708DE74E0DFAF4F8B11E4
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xE6B88D4F1F0CE38AD5B79A4A7D1C283A
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x92E6276AD300653E4825AFD35CD5A68C
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x3231DCA1DB32688571BC95F65BE258FE
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0x6005EF987A5664F5235EBE8C1152F4B3

As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x2D64DDA52B49BE2C3ACD90B2C7FBEF24
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x5B3FD75286DCCEE519C130CCFDFC594F
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xBE240193DA123575B5FD8C308A094A6D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0xFD52BB5A842A303888A75153AD08DDA9
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0xC195F6C502AC86DDD6A1718C0EF4173F
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xBC3846F83661815C16928318ADACC2F7
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xFE7DAD23435D88D76AB2825CF3CC311C
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0xA9B2215F860F8973EFB5942DE870E466
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x922B8EFA3375A4121451555DCEA88450
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x558289D2F215CCE999BE20F50F1FCE7F
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0x42CEFA71418C096E1F16A63565782292
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x30FD8759070E9949CEF1A505764A5173

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x13691EF6E3451C2F638280493299F5C8
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x5F3197EB0EB438EDFE29A0F7EC2AE316
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0xC6FC072DC90D6F463E4E0028D35FC8EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x48B007637385039AFEEED75EF24ADC51
John.
0x8F036C683D711970CC830985BB76A7DE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0xD9288BCE1632A7852C8689E19004F5C4
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x2597FB179E28993624220A7FB595E534
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x2A092FE767B3D4F870889D17A3E55E95
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0x9275B8659EE140CAF6BD6600CA7491A5
her own.
0x2AAA9238D02330767B86F24DBCD6CC09

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0x8ACBB73DC46341EDB60DF334A708FE5F
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x6EDCDB19CDF118673B0170B5F5B13B21
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x9EAF7BF7567019C04B439C820B5DA149
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0xB4FDA0430C5B47C81C368C92735C49C3
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x6901884F42DF3AE06AABB8EE44A9DFDB
papa."
0xE389A4300220B702E7354ADA7D1CEC05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x025EB4C51F05CB2AD2B1F45721075CC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0x51A7DFEDF7276F229294FC359D37CAA5
it cost him thus to refuse.
0xFFFC4302F7DBC770047B70BE59B793E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x21397F497D740ED481BCEBAC2781DA57
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0xD35D9D99B7FCD0C6DF505B69DD84D66B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0xF9C0484B09FDAB6ED34F4203AE10CD60
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x034FD3E65E8CA260BD8D21B85636E89B
returned.
0x8017254EA9937F9CDC07284CAF575EC5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x3881E597903602EB236A043DC998976D
blanched as her gown.
0xF8F2B95189433FE882515E4CB428689A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0xBF5837DEE563F22DEF19C1D252D415B5
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x96E99F83E674B0F954CA3A81941933C1
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0xD8B3F08766016AE3D25F2748FA56DFEE
at all.
0x60D3562860528FDCF4E4873E547EA777

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0xBCA969DA8E022224902B55469A6659F0
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x0B20055E3A0A736467A00B1948A36D9F
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0x17699470B367297FBCE15A992318DB7E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0xA6FFD7C46BDA3B2C0B9661ED68DA02D3
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0xEB4F7326371F9B7DFD8551D8F7A85E29
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x5B1C280204E54995D3768A96E7D4013E
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0x25C8CF1FEA7177A1A321C486837E6764
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x30B3528EDB43BE514C491952C5A6C180
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0xEF979B08AEC343F063587FCDBA6993DD
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0x7321FAA48C9E65A7E9577C7BA0986366
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x2109EA66A0813D44C575AA7E06E8A241
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x9FF44426591F4FE27ECC12ECB24AF8A8
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x7CF5C344FD50917F2771EFC0D9CBF43D
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0xC396AF54E9ABCB14C4C9D855AEC24DDF
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x0452D7A2FA37511CA3B5423AE6554CA1
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0xD2784F499EC15CC86A5A828C0AC71000
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x0DC00F26463E7E6BD2155C3198D2A502
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xD6A6DB34E035A811F34FFD4C8A95397E
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0xCFF42ED930E17E0EA6BB661787B7684F
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0xFE75E0665EEECB3CB91550093948D45A
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x6A62696945C0CC9DA7B4A3E2A28A97B6
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0xAA0690621CE0004D323C7D92A670692F
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x9C4B701344DF5AA1B35FA16E26D45E8D
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x2F5E8D93BF4BB906D9E824D43F48333B
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x19F775D6FED17372190C85D478F636C1
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x0E7DBD2A2070F05594FABB53B302C382
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x4C3703DB7C6765EDC07D1B30E640004D
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x209E3D11CF10EC35C2194DF729432E28
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xB44CBB06B8403774D4C9B0F2052C4F2C
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0xC22B9010B4E6AAC5A469F355931D88E0
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xD820DFB767B6E9B6C2DFCE1B6369F044
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0x40231A26718658B75173DFB18B487DDE
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x512FB240C650526E2E88590E5D02C901

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x371353BD2A595F416582EE8878C46757
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0xE7A75F309508AEEF650D21AFAFC77C1A
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x6C01CC9241FE3E32621AD2D338E8D421
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0xE097AC5CD855EDE9C7070349A1130367
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xC3810078CA77AD1E3B6AB8D319B8BDBB
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x98C50FE41312E802E6674A4FDA694579
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xB8FC8A58A08CA0E4217B4A3046B86D29
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x698ADCA740D9CB51E850CBDA175F81B3
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0xE94E235707E068B9AF4A63A0A42940A3
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0xB580AFCE3B460B203AC0EF662A4ED8DB
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0xBC20E89E08CB89A3B369A014B33110FD
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x4DDDDBD77FB655D1098C9051756D323C
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0xE8B721571E7506E8DFC8D49DC99793A2
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0xA85AE086CEAC86619F9B0745A1CC85AB
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0xEE505BE12D2D51CCC519F2ED0A2A3573
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0xCE6EA03A0151B818D05EEF316FBA5C53
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x251CD84B77F35F40DC262D218814FE10
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x442AA99CC71C246205CA8DDC91E86880
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0xB0D04B0B7FB081C64A18159F99679249
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0x99ED038299FDBE46FA895C589507AD9E
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x1F0395245755D1B250FFC2C5ABB93526
duties of the day.
0xCFCEA108E12F32D24D125052CA0D1DA1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0x23CB517158003DA85A683EBF9A228669
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x101127C9CB112FBE9B5C30C818ACC74D
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x7AAE24B3EF8B475FB4FC1D8D5B31F87F
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0xEC34C27516DBA56A4FC85BEA095CCE6F
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x56F6415D59726B9D0964938F9EEA9FF0
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0x0448F84D3D9B771E36E64A7093B38ADE
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x76E48E1B1E3894B5CFF1DBC9DD4E329C
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0xFA21211CD8638563B87B17035DCC6A35
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x19FD74D3D176561ECA5D579BD75CFC2C
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xB4D7845DCC02EC24C92D00F57EA69291
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x68F0E53A380BFCF07707EC2099FBD751
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x079D0157E4DFFD70130D032B0DEAA2A5
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x300CA941B0F0267ECCC78467D48EE898
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0xA0181865FDD818CEC7D7E6854A9B5F52
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x0540738FC93AE48B70F559DD1829356B
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x44245610B2662B8118B42F1570CA067C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x39CE9DF511F8BE89CA625014E20D96B6
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0x3DB32E7082A7781998D01677A349A8B2
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x48CC05A3BB9AC59E26E8DC187FAB09ED
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x6CD3F20B94BDA61BC9FB8EE0E4410085
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0xEA4EAB32016608EBE62444C79A25C75A
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x50C63E2295EC02EDE518CCB311340513
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x6C73D13B35405E80328EB7BF46707F1D
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xE97287D1E6610C83A872EE89413A7992
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x4B684294D020F0AC7F79A8A9F47A8CD9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x38B285D24BB969EB67877F65E3C54740
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x075C024C5C3D94B1EA4CCA62A4C1EF32
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x6CA5723840A352A53E884909738F67D5
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0xDF4106618747BB22A76819D1609BC49A
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xA95DDA0CFB2F17AE0E377E00EA0CFFAA
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0x85647115AE620C5885C34BEC74DE931E
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0xD06775464F01D242D9E934DFF544421D
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x59060CB3F6A92F2572DF6C25F27DAFB4
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0xC10296AF49093744E4419969439B87EA
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x75E1CBD5D6A426DC236CBB99293636D1
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x2A654D92583CF684E4FF2F463469E349
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xA22E49531DBC34B57B2AC33A4F2E0B2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x2AEAED40B497C777302BECEB3FF01F0E
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0xB6D66AC0F973E71B8B4182810CEA9A73
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0xCC2B469462704D2685016591487AC56A
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0x9FF9587F9E2F82FEC2EEE8CBC2B2DF73
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0xAF710A72F7AD36BAF5F97B0543E37260
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x7850C211D97E3CE15511C0EDF5823301
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xC627F84E40B5581F4B00EF8C5953A8F1
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0xD3A3DA7610FB494E74FD457B1A278AD3
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0x596339E43A54B77A0C715FC68865DB9F
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0xBEA7A4A3F136388322B01D6525B5BF97
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x24F6A14957CADDA0BEB385CA83C2025E
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xA8D6345781DF6DE519A7BAC7B6D5B9D8
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x7FAA503BC63C52D39A76E203313DB87B
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0xD5471F820480F6AB2A65036DA12AAD1F
acquaintance.
0x358E0F427E2687F8D2BDB46E36933BC0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0xC975CC3B836013B607E71D9EFD5AACE8
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x2DD0B3C6C093B4A169640C01E053E16C
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x3D284F9738B64DCF536A7395D2A5896A
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x37BDB69EDF53AAF1EDFFE63FDEEB3595
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x45CC2070EB4FE7101DE10872B9DCD107
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xAEA08865501529FF8F0BE4E379D9E6C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0xBF9C7459AFC4D68BA3D050A9A4863323
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x32B8CF36EEB74392B99AEECEB4878B49
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x28A76BB53FEA6C28A70CACF52E1AE9F8
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x19B72E1155E2160F9A1CC8BA76DCF28D
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xD9232E8E2B4B7DFFF3A8CE33D4D13A6D
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0x9542F0940B0E417BA998E4D893C1601B
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x7752AD1547F5076FFBC9E3124A6493CC
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0xE63CEC23BF651479FF9C5516B1B03F19

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x0FD75F118698A85F74D82808D9479F99
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0xA03D7096983C2799F4935ECD7B0F713D
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0xC36264EA795B50C070009636716335D8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x299FD9BBA545F4401E38B21E2F3F5847
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xA711470FF1C5A64F31938492B08B113D
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x0F778A1AAA67C28FAD644A52A61C961B
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x82045DE7D4A90655509B0D9B6F935C71
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x25E02800805ADF6F317ED44C80446C8E
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x189700662FE31EBA7DFF620884E8E842
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0xEE9F9041A828257D494C27A33DA3B0FE
day.
0x11D7DD35009446135989553989B36459

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xA48A81265E2D50AC0BDDEE387A007205
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0x2063C43E5D092F2E87DFCE49F48CCA98
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x2230E7D347D44119D326992CC1F44E73
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x120ADC2FDE5F251BE86168DE74986C66
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0xA04D0BAFBDC521738398F6A87D0AE53B
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x4122943EFEBF3F7B7A1B0B7BF83E078D
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x64A047FAD2D0C8AD50F01E7644C6E88E
Hall.
0xD352421F3CE574AD4547EA1C43C4B7F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0x24A1EC1318DD7BB18FA3917FDC1E568C
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x9B212756852480F4E0C98FBA0B64AEB8
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0xFE98CA91D8782AD94FE73FABD6E3882D
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xC3FD124BFB1D23047D275C72ED6C275B
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0xA1178F7EECF5E6824705F15DC4043658
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x71F8E5CA9AFE93D425FC7CAD8788F634
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x636A174CCD504197E5AA4408E7087FB5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xE6508CDD9CEFF5488C0844AA92412DDF
high family, papa."
0x58BCA6D3B9D5D742F9F148A695425BD6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x44C2956066981A009C7D2FBD25E0391C
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0x39A6BC8BA9C819E0D931B73948670894
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x1E7490383BC998C673F1B2F0F9C2FE8A
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xC0BA860E1D609FDB9E51210A41837C28
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0x69614C1D07B2DE26528C4185E3641A12
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x5FF56708206AFEA4D6A50AB8C8EF43E5
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xF97AEC326D5C9232AF041461C224057C
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x81BB9E8B21FF9A9C54E6F0F082C72266
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x3E15A58592E108742663D41E50549A62
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x5A264D2E219A59534B4CEE77BC419CAB
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x2580BAA18DAD5FBCBF3F150D3B71A665
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xC2C48B8B3FD4500577EDE4E87CF86301

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xCF4D49B8F78C87CCF5186BADD0EB4271
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x99E3265C753D98800D10DF1D963E52F8
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x1FB82EBDD35D201EF7B49FCFFEAED2A2
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x9789ABCC5348A44F2F3898A6C67EE0D2
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x02A0BBAF766A6B1A463693090DEC93D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x8B3389291DED7BBCA8E16EBF96443C09
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x4F45C9B8885119CBABB9946E9D207F55
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x904307343A22EEEFAE496A902E6B88A1
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x8CE93DA7AC62565C6A3BE9A9E47945B3
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x56A881DF4C5718B708527D6186B5853E
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x3FC37BD64FC8B3293B3DFAE37D47B37F
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xBD855CBAAD6BE424FACC2EEBB24B7485
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x2A189E038F2C25665D079CEFBE4B3244
Rivers.
0xB38415821D59256FBFD5D6A3E8A9498D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x4BEC7672B6D4AC5A5DA30077DBC76150
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x06530A922411DE9267D81A81FED50BF8
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x2CAD96F1FF37612812E031A0EA432E67
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xEEF765810F132D3710597821E43381F8
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0xDC3C910783D1C6490C1EAE9C3F432846
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x0ED8A13B38466D688C768DD71C3B9B8E
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x3ED49D928A8AB719E85541A60383D54E
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x4A1836AC7086822618C283AFF9CDE2A2
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xFD51E5306ACDCE49075FF9CD50E23519
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x37CC1AAFE963F3A6C28A3F4550276030
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x20CAE5BF1A98B19B8B60548534ED1C1C
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x2B79DCC8F114799A57493CBAA8FD1226
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0xC5F859D4C24177EADBA98142EE1BBF52
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x0C77174A01F21B151BB4F904F4F12E93
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0x8CC4E7C104A068909746C40FA700A518
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0xA89304BFC19D35A3D78DD2843C5D2969

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x54B0826A01E75F009216790374D3BEC0
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0xBFAABCAA4123C385EBDECDF710527F86
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xEFDE7207601B96B87F47DB079C6E742B
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x96B706B1A2164C6F5C9805D18A9B7AA1
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x1E16075C1CB10328B4233576AED3CC89
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xBB49AEDF2731EEA58D84724223D6A491
him some good, if I could.
0x61AFCCA3D60F3AD88903BB94975499E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0x3F7676083269E9CB882CEEAE1FED459D
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x5F71E9687DF828D7704EF65417947FFF
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x334548DCDDCFC1B07BD902D1A5FA3DAE
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0xC23979C2D9688E174416EB89AAD38FBA
him talk."
0x2FF09DC8B7276550E9F5522EC38FA27C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x4A23377946F16A2ED18710C4074E3904
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0xDC6CC7E1EA784C5BE95555532E5F1DBB
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0xE61554061E2AA6BD93C703A5E1E8E586
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0xFF1C35237EEA4AF1D8D3FC5AAFBE50B7
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x6B4D9ED8C65CE876F564472A75CA7EB8
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x32D85E9BFEEB064C1DBD53CE62250155

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0xA4973D91AD4415FBD7CFBDBAC5CA6B98

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xB8DFCB833AC7B0A9E4815A3C3E453CEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x205B300433CD63B651570417383AA124

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x667BC6AAA1B6CBB6DF71BBF5EA9CD653
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xC97955798FF91B908F78D9CF02D4029C
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xDC29437BB98AC9D8458B158B8619C571
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x0E12A540DF3BAA416AE313AD50F4D064
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0x165AA05F89564BB59DD2AA1BC92A08CD
rose and placed it in his hand.
0x2D71533DFD666C5B75A64BB28E598D1B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x847B3C36AC88F886E59A31DE6A5D1CCB
graceful and correct drawing."
0xD1C7AC744F486404B99DF34E88BD2803

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0xD756135EF0F40DD1D46A11AEF30DDF2E
like?"
0xC0C2C9BA6556AF9879EBE2FC75D3D91B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x156E4A379AC8EFFCADD3AF635170A006

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x4E22E670B7F5BFE8082095691918D0A8
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x4BC0D78E984D3A1BF65D08B5D3A19CDF
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x85D2E8EDA81175427022D6D95A269DE3
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0xF7BEEC0DADC138E03C8C9C92618BE722
deem worthless."
0x7CD3E0AA97F5BC94367DE056D94F38D3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0x8DC57C18A664ECDDFCFF53E03E4D8225
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x3BBB89302B6F90F210C265543A5B00F1
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0xED05CC5B7BD64A81F06DEDD000CCF2A1
smiles!"
0x1335082A75B7E006F4FA6ED4AA700ED1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x877FA6EB8FF2EC37FAA26995A609D945
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0x90E8DCD466C19EDE9D8D37DF0EDB33B1
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0xD0A4722102F3C7D932B030CA25612CC0
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x02195EF70C88BE2382E9CEF5B9E89CC2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xFDE9AFFA681F68F5641302A69C306801
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0xF240065E531A3510D4C7034539B216B4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x3D591DF6E26B957D95CB3054E081E41D
or wise is another question."
0xBC26FE48C3A6DC4DB1B65BAD8B8FE4DC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x5E1D7362F0C899EAEBE55739D24039FF
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0x1FBB8B0F33248A31A671E1C2A7E07F2D
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x98DEFA99793EAE1E981A659C17D99EDE
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0xCF38CC24E79EFA656037D4C88923FF2B
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xD9AC89CF870069280C0939879479596A
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0xDD0A30DE43E3B610D09AC677BF93D665
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x651FC3F0815CB69396B57ED3EC72C59D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x8CDF871AB57579C0005ACC47E753AF8C
take to yourself the original at once."
0x8C92CA85755FD340DEF64411F36EBE5D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0xD2F95A7CF675B36BE1329BB44FB97D3F
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x4E7357E8DEADF2EE634743866391B93A
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0xB2D9C2DB92D5AF5AE528638C1742A9A8
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x364C6CF624094AD115D605E2BB3B9169
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xA361735CDCC327FEF4474B324D5F9ED8
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0xFD2739B775DF2EAEFD7E63D7F1361119
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x88859D48AC210EF5B1B71B34F00A02C5
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x20D85718573837475E5CE26277A11169
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0xC5AB1C296499D04BF39B2A015BE6FFBE
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x7F4E0A6339E00B30939D2534A439E4E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x7DE0E7382948DA00D4668815C480D261
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xDF7D22A807258D6D7F02630A66FAE848
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x8659D8309051DDA694BA1CB68F9BF931
ought to marry her."
0x7243FAE083E5ED476C0A6EC35F25266A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x8B8E3745148C9C7C500C70AB474BF76A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x35E082C102AB85097DF831ECF592A4D3
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x3D130F205BD52F6D961135CC58D9989E
often."
0xFA2C1895086F6618C6F9B6B6A78CC52E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x2D0C16A46035948905A0EB81A5682F79
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0x80B398703B57342475E1326A1ADC1AFE
the table to measure the time.
0x7D5E4E00E121E575CE387D918AF02990

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x794E92BC41FD1342C469B82945B767F4
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x6404424E28A31118468A2643F0419953
fetter your heart?"
0x30CF5078400A948C8C49CE005D07BD58

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x3BC65A4EC962FDF9AFF2350CC836CF10
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0xD3CA5581BB2A699E0B4B0DFB2F460C1F
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x5C9016E2DD4611867BA0BE006A520202
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x27C9F1133DD482F0FFEFBC4AFCAFC28C
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0xF6F250E3099E4EC3993EA3C606533DA8
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x0B3191AA435285B22EA8E0CA2F7CF00A
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x426FEE4C9E9328F8162D89BB41DC8D6C
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0xB7EB0309D699FF718302907C4E1A3E74
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x44A46E38AB040CEEB77147E8C8BBBCC0
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0xB95633DC03B9C2442BC974C6E2458068
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xBCA82F8CE8E7E6957158C86C80F9A9B6
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x3FFA337BB22277E4B2D89325D1168774
time I marked pass in peace."
0xC6D711C50B4CE3074E609458EFF028AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x7445EA52B7D629072093EF896A770CAD
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xF1731E4A81459A9AE134EC54C041A104
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0xED5BE7E842F2E9C3D967883D5E04625B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xD6FF4DC4F767944677E5C805BC3F4CD4
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x539455DBD44B658418D4C96B13D28DC3
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x12A91956088625EF10CC83304E6B37B5
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0xB054F2F7B322CDDE8FB14AEDD6E8799A
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0xD07489CB7A6CBBF9D76873B3DEB2BE95

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x6B43197B28936AAD51A2BEE9B19D57CC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x69AEADEFAEB79CF0C0BCBAC4DF851228
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0xEBBC6E58C2C41AF7451A55884B13C127
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x62186516F63C64F69C2B2425EC9A526A
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0xD18D8BBAD37E850EB654A9230BB4E002
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0xA80D84D7809212B8E29549D9066A3B2B
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x6EC926D28163211C085F25DF2609D94D
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0xC6187353EE70B1305A06BF8486BA1170

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0x0A024DDA14C4E3A98BCC1714267F3653

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x5AFC595AE909D87A2789BEC0A668E948
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0xCD0496B070349CCA73BEE3CCC1F5451A
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xF147CB782028E381AB1DAB1EC85F981C
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x9D01AFA775EA32B6FB9A6643C4EF081F
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0xACA11A0BD7A753E1AA9E33CF91150C27

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xAC18C87C33FED36B2CE274CBD48FE400

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x5502F658CDA13D0B1ABEDF5380313820
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xBB1F8FD369C9EC72F4C03A33EC14BCDF
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x3E818DB7469DB580BCEE2F3DE90D4663
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xFAD666D71E32F958CCDBCB2EAA0A95AA
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0xB29EBA857AEA96377E63A213FB70D5AE
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xBE381C6D8046D17506027863788075C2
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0x84F9B4B0A94247578D34E9CCD740F722
live for."
0x43D3FC7890638FABA3C8956D3D682462

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x42E064C931097A765346382A97C22A32
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x90B000A918C1D666BCC4E1D16C94DCD0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x601BD0090F2F7D83667D21C9753E495D
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x9B80B148DEBDCD10A73E099B77D3B423
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x6DAA8AFF4D330647ED83655D1CD9D070
should do."
0x570730292CE3E93C77809B40AEEE435B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xF0BDD36409282FED4CE0DF6A99557457
wasting away."
0x72B838875E4590E19D483ACD058C24BF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x23CF284230F762A9218D37E785E9BFD1
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x9FE43C108F142A6F417FF1F7B02F8411
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x0F7F884A97F9BC001F0EEEBCE9CDBF81
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xA280348BD3F8B053CF8F81313B15F05D
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x52567523E604B2B55FA494A7A0B161F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x71EB7E1604F4B5A6E76B95E33D0D977A
schoolroom."
0x2C6167A72C3F7137099A0C44D6D3D274

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x4B237B349FF97E76AEF4CAF092FFB5F4
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x808B42B5205DE106A138FDEF1684FEC5
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x7906E30EE54799B17AED5A8F3B213408
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x46BA9187F093A30BACC24C07E80AB3DE
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x445FAE22CE8B53A27D53628E583D6ABE
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x99E04EEA94D9FE1A995BC7E2A6983B8F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x0C76431B22AACDA66A77DF2032CDD061
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0x8ADAFCBFBE318FAE205EFFE3C73318A3
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xC32B60BCAC4756A9B92D21033FB06F42
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x37ACA55F6E282779FF6D013A86FC5543
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x6518AB620A684AD7B6C1A26CCE9681EB
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x8060695B48CC427197CD756D701652BA
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x96A3D42E861382BEBF86F9397D6199CD
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0xFC006C62DB62F1972EC8B99B5C1D7B21
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x01923657F24A869EED1627EBBE6CFEFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I smiled incredulously.
0xB5D168A51015356CE111634CCC5A5C85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0xC721D59AFF1CB734099A90C67AEA902A
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0xE2D4293E2BA962237F685F28E5C232D6
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x911DE3F5E9E9523BAD1F89AC59C06CE0
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x047DB764EF05A982D8A18C7D3EABB6FD
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x8977FB8901B808A813B05001D2638F40
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x314267AA9EC937D17AFE95B3ACF74513
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x8E921AF023C1D196F88DB21C63722A08
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x4D0D8E6FDE013EA91AB23459A224FFBA
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x0C4AFA3E0BE3196AF691189AAC8B8910
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0xA533EE5F406CD5EAE1B2FBACEADF7F5A
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0xC08F69616FA74BB45F1FA61BF9B0400B
still suffer."
0xA180FF2B4123C2A0A4CFBBF108413DEB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x4BAB158848EB876CBE8E3FD2FCB225AA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x73C4A23061FE25360DABEB377A02C07E
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x655D3707AD134E5B9984C98C6452CFCA
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x8EA214AB2D6ED3A400CFA227B004A55F
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x3D91493F49AF417179B91423A973E89C
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x574DE4C891FBCE0AF3E9F74FDB33D534
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x12D8A2B35A83E4BD3133A6ABB9F02FDC
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x21F5B886ADA173705703387C2057F762
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0x4315B95C76162AF4B9AFEA36261A09DE
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0xC078792AB3CF724D013125CE3BA9ABFA
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x2E4C0C0577438A759B4702910E3A8CDC
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0xA37D64E3653C57AD20720B6CC31ED2EB
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x2E9773DB2E2E912A33805E40A62BA83C
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x2E2D75946C31DF9136C37E54CA8F78F6
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x33693C6F8894F0F21F8D951AB9112593

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x4A1306D6B726A2A519E258ED10DD498F
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0xFC6C7C1B840A7D7655B31A9906C1A3D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0xD047726192C165286A1975355AA95FC7
World, indeed!"
0x75CFDC7B329F63BB2B5ACD8300F29E88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x939AE12A45F4C10189A0F068F7AF284D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x4ED9191275B912A61D915E1DB57957E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0xE3888144EA3DAEEFAA6CA3865ED23B9A
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x77434D474B5B0C0215AA6647D5403D67
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x5059AE5AB2D3875EEEA311CBE0009A58
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0xE176CE8C8AE2D5ACDB0B0FDA4C85E6B9
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xDBAA816D226495D2DF16454283AAC6CC
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0xB806B1C1FEB7E2002FC9D8BA3DF4FF51
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0xFFAC7B580BF51EB5AA5A39C0B1D646E2
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x33D50070BEE04107AA853E3E6BE4DAB6
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x2889FC64427750925822B553C5DF9C68

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x3DED6B29726ECB8254AE0CF8CDAB7474

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0xBB22A4005C047FEB89089C9AE85A6913
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x80C66D7FF9915DEEE840982FA2EB29D4
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x9B3B308E6EEEE8339B5C1870FE03E113

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xF08FB4626C0B3C4CDA2D912570EAC343
globe, however!"
0x0838EDC21146B7D729B15CE52B2A178E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x4713ED83534D9F4B25743CF4D469A790
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x2347E3A57E2E4FA8D4A6E9296EEE6DEA
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0xE4B35CF1E437EA0783FEE0286274C5B3
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x27AA2AFF62AF2F5076529A927304CD35
forgot it.

CHAPTER XXXIII
0xDC565EF731F360A299B7ADB2A1936229

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x2EBC21EF58754470F0CAF56A61275298
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0xDF606EEF45A4A9616BA640609185B630
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x8EA5523A3E443C53B14AC80EC80D4AF7
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0xE784D094AF3BDDA684CAAB8631C4783D
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x9E81B11C65C14B5B856681F89C59DBE9
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0x32CE504DB9091486895DD0477F0B74D3
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0xE9835661CD58906ACDA4B24274A01E08

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x08E5BF09D0A681D24B5096EA13EB5145
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0xCDFE7670F4EF1897400A19A9C2B89B8A
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x2C23EB9672F6E709D93C6DE2FCB69298
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xE04855FC0831040B4775B44116A807B8
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x75C11A976E16231AB0D1E0FF00848A49
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x0CC094E912A161188AAF03CB8EED705F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x67C1F05517B40EA5E6BDC1EDC8CB5F52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x20BC2C809C0070D4D55C05B4CC6EAFFE
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xE35D531E054C9ADEA2C5994643EB8FDF
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xD48A9555110F103360D8523F9CC3DF77
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0xC2D972431E2265D73ECF1CF15D0A8325
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0xB9F2F4E1FDBCAE2D342862627C9494FB
vale that night.
0x2CCBC559DF95C4C0B80D05D402246176

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0xB5A11F68A42B55BA9F85D1D8DDA8137A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x48733D82090E107761D6872199ED89D3
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0xC9DCD8C7A0934F727B5676ABFE940BFE
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xFF9CC1F52847CCE670986091B5F87B4E
boots.
0x0B0681CD926BE09C995C951A5C222CF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x1E4573012B5203761E7E14A3F496DFF3
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0xA2B348893B37B51547582DA55439BC2F
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x67DA1158249F0D5DC891CDEB2D8A85AC
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0x4DA191710C99917ACF6316EDF8AFEA83

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0xB1BB314B159572D03AE7A89FCFED75A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0xF0A912B36908148645001F9D71C5B462
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x2FCAC7FEAE54E7545E25EFA2B9F5D09B
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x116C44D147A01FEC410FAB0893062767
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0xAF86A3323D15154224D5BA460E8F14CC
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x65F8A4DCE23B892F16D1C12E029E2331

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x75A2CB298946D1FD5594D3EAB46320C3
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x80D87E9A659D7ACAA1BAA15339B5978C
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x1B435E1B8FEE3F138C27F11E9C7E90E7
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x0A799CE0258DCB675F828B92763E7FFC
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0xC236A1B26B902EDA8E958BF6B45257D0
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x22F7D30A9C8D65E469F716CF8D77385B
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x05FEE978377A2B8FDA682A1F8377E001
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0x310DFF3146636FB69A60F54FB3045AF2
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x1D03A666A59F7339E44673EEBDBA04B1
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xABF0C885EDFAE1AFA8EDCA74CCD72492
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0xAE082F2B16C481140F79F2FBA052B3B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0xC536CD8CABC7C60D4740E74410320A68
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0x9C96C98B50A13C333D0CB94B048F8F58
health."
0x72D3BAD179A23C44BC0BEA45877F9FD8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0xE11ABAFB724AC923DE1E59B2D8EECFE3
What do you see amiss in me?"
0xB1483578A405E8D8B638FD5E612ACB9C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xB34971C775F584A5C3EB46433153929F
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0xA0F53D6B8D691E3108E6D32B51AFD041
silenced.
0xD566CB81CF83D03E17F4396FF5830D82

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0xA35133EDD3CD6B8531CF983410575C5D
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x0046EE682D289435B86A5E8F2203DC5D
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x4C6DDD2FAEF61537E135DF88B6A0F943
was behind him.
0x86B4632E3F8B092A0ABA52BBAD589FDF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xAB252A071ECEBCA7C4B06C409D425319

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x963705D8A8C506190522A644E9870DA5
alone now, and return to my book."
0x47AAC0DE6416F62BE7C3E30786031519

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0xCCA2EF5AB97336F8FC47BC8A16F1234C
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x00AE7A40196C4A084CB2088BE6235471
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0xC90841D8123D538729CD5C19EB60A8F2
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0xA632A8A57602724692BA58E65ABCC446
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x2DACCEF1A1D3FB7C34C2361C3D277825
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x132F99E976D95C48D37AED6810181AB8
I would.
0x337C8034CB52F54C1B3953369024643E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0xB5738D74C730A6BA6BF45018AB1FDFBC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0xD34DFA8A2297DF9D6D93043F4AABF4A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0x0F1355D4352FF37F660113B4C71243DF
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0x612E61D29825113C04915DB78D10E7C3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0x402018BEF79DCBBC0592F5C23FC3B097
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x17F6F2C30D7DC49619BFC2A43C419311
and my scholars.
0x6CCB174A57B34AD72071CA7D3C15AE01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x4BF5FA95389701F44275698485A05ECC
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x60A4AC43F0D184CA63A16EB077F7ACE8
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x1F0DBB2C4DB6DE4965EBC076983574C0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Indeed!"
0x81942B1E95EC54076CA141D1264F8187

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0xAE37F279DD86414466534FD0B0F3F6C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Does he?"
0xC585B64B1E4354533E5E1C2602FD2800

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0xC9E808C0176A25B50B9DF997F17668CF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I know."
0x19C49995422ADBD9F1A5AC27F7B1F5F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x21A3784911E1D41EFF8C343D41410703

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No."
0xCE36EF61FB1B0510BC0DAC4717647CEC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Whose, then?"
0xD1EA0D61B0478407D7D8053166E258B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"His daughter's, I think."
0xDA5AF0A916B5EADF7982C17838FD11F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x34E3D79A8F9EBA321FB419235D263878

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x6DC3EF975277C665DAF72D7AB5F8FB34
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0xEB7917B12E9B7B15810330924D660BA4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0x7E62F8C5EA0F732BE8432DE798CC1B15

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0x9085F9D1D7910D78018328816CC653AA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x4EDEBEC228685039D66D92E857C3AC4F
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x8A72972AEB5A220D6017C202FDFC1C19
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x99861E3D3F65464E067009D47F25114D
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x362D82A67C435C1F1A8BC5D0127F3935
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x5B742A80EAE29AFC8243593052E846AC
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x0AA0A1143BBF7A6425C0C111DE9E2E38
trite or novel, it is short.
0x39A85EA7A6678E1D4B6872CE9311E861

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x340906D8F9F3AEA056EC453AFC009FA1
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x158461DF2744944AEB38AF6D1968A004
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x9A396FF3416BCBD9FB93F87EED11289F
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x291A4284BD83C7BCCD0C0AC6668134A7
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x033DA7E8DCEC5878CBC7697948372FDB
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x4E440969C7765EF630308CA45444BDD5
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xFBA789C2DD4D5C5486F592DD8BE6772A
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xF18C3AA7D63B34B6E99888A6452C5670
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0x15F265E00C4BF21AB1D9FAE996837143
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0xF5548CB527AE4A17724CE23FC02CDDF5
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xD5F7F66CE6EF98904BE3A03E3CBC9AF0
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x205AB693C872DE0B98DDF10F17C796FD
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0x76752CA8F73798B3AFBF46A34523E3A0
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xD4D93CEB243BD7294F02BAD729F8472A
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x46DB2F782283BEA9339C76A9D152F8C9
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x41A641E6DFBD8F09B6C62866AD373B5C
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0xD167711A314DEFCB73F8DA8F66505EA5
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x88783CC4BB68EBC3388B6A7D7F06A2F1
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x06836AF8E3B4C4DF3178A2DC97247EAE
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x9DFF1FD892F97D3476B07810B2B357A6
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0xBD60A69003C06373D36D28AECCF135E2
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x67D63619DC3A33EB352E4D9572FDE824
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0xEF679EE9D34F3A3937805ED39FB25618
Rochester."
0x9D496C4FA466225BEB2A3E86A30C8806

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0xDCE6C532AD6A543AA32069C65C27FE52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xC783F06F69098B5DE2F39D91AA74BAEA
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x54DC25131B4E0A0CE4F85DCF56DFC8BB
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xF2422A998832FFC88F3DEC58B604254B
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x6D9AE6CE6E25197E62610163036822E3
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xEB344D9E5A658D0E57D733B2F14684D6
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x3235486B8BEE87E09F174A7CCC445768
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0x0AB56CE9C7E88B5BEA1DEFFFBE12E831
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xE41B12ECB30D85A25ABD0BA695D79C2A
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x487C77249F5645908E2ED78A4CA94588
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0x5304493676214900163F630FB59D9336
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0xE69C950E320C093DB22C0F8170BF3E8C
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x6CCF97B056803A2A03491E2AD86A1141
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x3DA7DBC1BDEDE83017C137F46AB8B2D7
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x28730D4875551F03CE1571DEED529526
odd tale?"
0x224EBCAE09ECB23992849333E56D3D63

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x2A4A04E5D7CB244A2A50A0B7ADD13044
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x9228B819595BE36C1AC8F59C202D851D
doing?  Is he well?"
0xBC0518A0CE62C9DE67A39FE5A26D6660

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x61393E8FF6A9B154D4C5780F1752DA95
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x71268F56F93E19B4C2440FC1DCCA1C39
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xF2D61AEF712228AFCC5DC7325BDA28AC
which requires her appearance."
0x8009521E7245C410F9D6016B5382D58E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
0x108BD692FF4BB2B8E748CE67CBF716B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I suppose not."
0x5F669659E2EF5A53991B3403BC5CAE45

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But they wrote to him?"
0xF4269A8029CCA40392B08D4FB111EC4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course."
0xB35D0A3808BEB0C7F566A3B7D444026E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x6B17B43E9A3490A0DB3E2EF6B8332F9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0x25E14022E607592CA0E2799BC0298A85
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0xAC7A5BE55C98CA440791F67B30D0A58D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x7A31BDF55B7E0CDF6EDE98CC90D6C479
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xF044F8D893FAC28706A039AD6A8B302F
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0xD55EB3F937C33FFFE605E7412F64FBB8
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xCB05AB9F5D5F33E2B83B1ED5641C7687
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x9FE13C5CDFF6D56EEA019C6C28A4F85D
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xF8218997A6E1C96D079D188FC4CF27E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x06572AD432549DE5837EC0875CAD27DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0xA16E51DA7065EBB749BB8EE1360C3AF8
warmth.
0xA73F8D12C28728754C9E1458F7B95CF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x00C480ADB09750680B9B5771DFF3806F
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0xEA87EA047F0BAA1D1B28FBE19A5EC07C
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x12AB072D27B5DB5FE4EF4EA172B3AAD5
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0xEE3180697E3F81B9BDC3E64348E9B498
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0x5C89F7028084FADEBF387D496EEABF2C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0x4A6F49818333483731501FE4422FCFAB
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0x97E37AB3FAB77457ECCC39BA8D347CF8
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0xE3D80F6D9B8580DDB78C2632D64ED9F4
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0xE980484C06EDCC2341AC74512B10153D
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0xB1154F335E8123BBA49C9A5B93A7BD72
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x167FD48E0CFDDD33A35868C04AE77225
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x6487E3F9B4B58AE5D6112F5A84168641

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0xC1E5876634270FDB678AD5DCC5DCF4C1
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0x6698A766A27C761651B5C4CA05F02105
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0xB48BBDBCEF6B6F1062E9F445BE1E052B
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x687113A8BF68547A3335C767CFCA9182

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x67D99889922026537AE10681FB461BFD
Rochester than you do."
0x046B22259F563F8CF8E01B5E35D82C6C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xB6058C21532875BAF1CE15F8278DE498
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x350490DACB55B36AF37D46C347930F0A
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0xE7D8BB008E5835EF7DF0305A19B7ABF3
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x1C8AEEA4C6361B369F8F858E67788E80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, what did he want?"
0xCCB444A08637AB9E25ECCC3D9F60E75D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0xE47430DF416E61F3EBE968663A8118D2
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0xA118ED5A306850DD83B11E173EA40C55
that--nothing more."
0xF7F3AF7A9DD796908FAD28CA2495B055

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I!--rich?"
0x73393AFC7E4CDDDE1509C093B9E0B2A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x08FF378249207F3281AB79879653E18D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Silence succeeded.
0xCBD4A81C495BAD76A6F72F6FA688807F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0xD222F2AB63D9EB51CB7C18D325CDB40D
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0xEACECB956929B45DF961685A8A4AF938
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x408A8E074D536744B6C1DE6807D80DEA
will and the necessary documents."
0xD764FC335D977272CB88E3DF9431B408

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x83A6C0B7F4D8C3EEE154F0746A3DF781
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x1B1CC73ED41FF18548738559D983501E
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x3A639B5F2FEAC318173E0ABDDAB6F962
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0xF0193965A64ACBA12E3A0E52A306C126
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x8912712E8C0A266F36CBEFCD87DCF599
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x2422970AE9EAF9626C245424AC9A76FD
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0x30A3ECA95466548DDB099869DCA63238
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x97A0DF6E05F00FEBD3DE39EAD84ABAEF
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0xC2C5CA52A9E35AB0576FBA92BBDCA1C3
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0xF6C4D74203A848D9E632F18471C25A54

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x48C782474B3A3B6172A159251F87910F
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xBE8FB65C73E9DEC9C490456C13435588
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x7A30861D2B384C18BDC1D3BD3FEB2E64
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x6C2F37F4B9F1422FDFE5F912EB2C57AA
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xA9A3B177E1E866183956FF6E66577624
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x0A5FCCCEFE3FA0B9CFC9F804D6A58695
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x26402B7FF12D6EC16E488800424D864B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x4CE36476FB3716E4C7A21B8860007AFA
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x19AE461CF3A6DCB7B8B7F3EF466EA2B0
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x947FD100362652CCA30478B1EF7C56B8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How much am I worth?"
0x6E0865E4F692A7C285E4804602C8A2FD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x25BE0537C2B0072CC8712D835635DAE6
think they say--but what is that?"
0x7483E053AE6BAF2599E75F99508A1DC1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x98C4AE7E32DD0F709C87D23CA0EFEDB6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x7E93A81327F8E28EB9C7EAC6CAD55142
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x7526ADEAE1068F5B2A3AB28F07793A19
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0xE0530B21E4243C3E738D88ECB5753234

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x759DAA65A20DD8E7BEB2531BC931D47D
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xFEFD19557B6A3961C1D6A89D2F77BD49

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xAF77605C75A2E53A7836E1A45DAD9377

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No mistake at all."
0xE6180711D9FD29B0F2A52ECBBB1B7BAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x443F3EDB36C88E7ECBABA1D4678FCEF4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0xF5E9F7C1780C02213A46CD83B4C3D4BB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x09B2EC1857F59D560EEB6143572914A7
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x35C547922E18EFC711E6AACB20674ECC
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x1ECD5DC2CE7D138F27C44166E9B469C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x22049475D2C5B226532E4DA1D4370FF0
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0x0FA826F47EE6BD656E3E8F7620637C65
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0xEEE31AB43F1866903B79C332C259D9CA
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x9C5D460B72D5C81F3592D4177E8D5179
Good-night."
0x3DD910DBE4670394680DD2512B40BEF7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0xC5736070A8AF0DDB94B8043DD284D3DC
minute!" I cried.
0xC533CD457168F087CA9C8A04E0187DF3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well?"
0x910EA6969671EE3BE702CBC63E5D47F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0xD7EE2C50BD8AABB44A65FD88E43C1990
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0xE39A3DFBD685685C1DC5C0B5F189DB27
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xA51C484279ADAA30B4A40F84108E3DD3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xC048737F7E624ED84FD7E4746E1EA83E
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0x6A86ED3335B1CEEA9B4B430A66D79F05

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x32780F743C478F1F0F3A9435BCD0B415
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0xD0EA739E81374C6A2355B562960E726F
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x0CB5EEFC4F0D7ED9AFB2AFB5485B76C8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0xB833B7078B25A32853D186368BE59590
about it."
0xF3D5C4C0CE8E5718743EED67F21E3692

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Another time."
0x2C284A64ABDD3CC3F6994E6FA16CAF6B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x64DE19F6CC3990AE76DC9B3998E40334

the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a

0xC33C589A8EEC8FF90C4F1FAA5AACA1B7
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0xA6D2E73252436987E8502296C6672622
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x2E66E37039EFDEA537A4DA9C5E7A3D90
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xC35867942CA465C4A5F969AF33E96276
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x49CBB7FB238B455EFD59838F55732D4B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0xFA604CD45CDB1FFB689057461C455E52
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x040159CCD02740A3A6D8B03313755381
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0xCB7C1C5A5F198577616CE72DFABCB7E1
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x73B834F8AEC1B2A651CF334D2E8C402A
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0xB0BCD184706C0C1E7C84722AAF4F5534
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x7C6D6910FFAB73B1E2900E56F0601E22
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0xFA1BD82076A2CA6FEC39D4F8B0927D4B
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x1B54BFE0342528A310D9A90320910964
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x0C62905686FAB92173A38D28C3A8CA1A
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back

against the door.

"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and

reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x3824A81D3381C64929670917CC59BC14
enough.  I resumed--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0x5F4ECC6FF8EDE37E5451BD67D490FB68
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xE6153931103FDB16EBCFA982C0ED907C
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0xA59DFB680F05B8A0FD12F50A4B6F6A8D
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xB798F7421408441FC0F8A423DA1900DF
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x87EE8D05BCEBD9C510BD5E17F3D15814
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x49FD29FC9EE97A2A67C0ACE1F968758C
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0x3463E85887ABA2C525AD002B71C5F5FE
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x9C8A2A52E8B192D704A93344D3C5669B
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xEF00BF4E33F61998E2F41637FBDD6B4A
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x014623D06A9C3E14BC1B8C2C6E3D2D65
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0xB91C9D2277A764C27CB34900844131D7
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0xDECBB321384C30E97BAB463AE88CE61E
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0x34DBFBD3103DF5D0C388CE3CEEB277B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x3993154AA31B02DF9CBCE7B8764ABC2B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x6FF5FEC4303F20FBF8405BC8BB66B66A
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x7DAD09D0D44B6BCFEFDA8AB7ABD44FC9
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0xB50A8CD2433A84821EAD699051FBE608

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x9B9785C5F9CDA3A3CFB30CA4C07092EB
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xED598BEA20558055A9336609F399C807
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x21485D199B157CD7C96A5F71C2C0850A
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0x7EFF8BD6C0010C0BAD2E338BCA9C4EDF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xEB43A14351F138B0954BAE2A4494C381
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x085C122D3644D854CF60CFA1733C5924
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x0D016B6210DF07C9B301745118B20B3B
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x3E53E1D05CCFB0AD7B1B3D5F3549D419
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x52E39451905533288D4C614BD2B66C47
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x8772198A78FE7C26CDB2396E8F218929
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x8BC25217F7185181C685AB58992F3F5B
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xDF5DEDF85F33613805D540D33142E12B
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0x96BA82115539C0489557510CEB8AF189
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xAF67B3D1F7AAA6F47B0F2B52A1EEC39D
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0xB22682A0468BA3DFA359CE3231C5040A
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x5443BCD41FCE3D9CB19814D236E06F85
enjoyment.
0xAD0C81727467573F50C1F08475844D9B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0xBC160D3636C93794E4436DACB3268BA4
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x4605323AB1E12F32D3252164DC3C4D68
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0xDB12910F488AE59A5F14E433606A5D44
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0xDC5E4E5E32CA77CAA315E1E038DDF8B3
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0xF8B32C2C6DE0CDC9AC874E925B7DCE30

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xE76F31C4C23EAC214D4EDC8C080BBEBD
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x7AA35065AB61D7BD2846862B5FFEA23B

other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly

0x7D0F9E45D3EF10C3EB9C702B7160BCC8
consider it absolutely your own."
0x658131949AE044FBCFB6B534C9A90B63

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0xCADFDCD72DD670A881F108E49970BC77
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xA98E014AC4A8C97459F968D0835846F1
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xFD446AFC698BFD2CB847BBF6954E3C1A
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x498F2A2E7E45BBB6058B8C8A55AACE40
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xC1D874CA0CAAA51F0E981C36B393E680
myself lifelong friends."
0x0E4ABE1C87510794B9372FD497B66310

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xF25B1C0C13217FBC73A0BBA3760A2D86
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0x21E7AF6FE6D4B8E2D4DD37AE5A51A188
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0xC9FDD828EE7A194006993AD92856EAC0
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0x031951D71F98FDC9679EC1007609A3A5
you: you cannot--"
0x0DEA50D08DDD6D4D44D8C5CD606427E2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0xA5682A3EAF23BE942659A988E5890BE0
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0x92D07EB8AA74710AF2EEF532DA331A00
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0x4034BE5369F3C64B92A8C12C8D619CDC
and own me, are you?"
0x391883526015B680CBF98D62572A4F4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x733E089CD5D01A23D7E24FBF428F58CA
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0xECB71850397B4907F699C41CBB169FD0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0x9EB2E5025ECC817C5BA35D9C40E99476
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0x82B756B50BF7C31150557F32E6099532
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0xB3AA7C28388B1759299ECFE4CC026C28
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x7C8E9A3CAF47F66FE2AB0DC53585DC4C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0xEDF84788A76DC50074B16B86F24867F8
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0xE4E4025FBAA8075D2929725F48F64C1D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0xD9B080618EE48ED4A52F7F15E41396C2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0x370102126D0ACB3759106C768C374573
excitement under which you labour."
0x9F5E9ACA600283102B95A515FA317138

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0xE90DB31B9063649E175EC26C9AEBF7DF
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x5137634100D4C4B7B014DE2BF466A235
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x0696B2AAFC43ECF705374D308D573C1C
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0xBE44BE05205AE55C63233EAF0D9F1C57
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0xD654F5F56FE04EB0F34E330BF3B97F5A
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0xC1A9E7FD37B26DA5A48920A3450064FF
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0x11C2FE5BB942DA9E22E2BF57D11F9105
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0x76777A26C72A9E44D734879CC4A6F23B
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xF6A1AC2718CC7275F54E31D4AAE6CC18
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x486181DDE236F7BE719CF0ABFBDBFF54
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0x18B362F4DF76AE97A75E30344FE9933E
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x201E728728663516F7CDCB8FA620A0C7
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x01840DD4820546CE75E9D87F2988DF45
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x6AC7FBC4F738DEAA21E63CEE61EDFA76
scruple."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0x11F59B9234AD3D1453243649516E9EE6
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0xC4FE508ED732DA5FFDC3346DC2E7CBE0
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0xA8781938B85D402083DEFB4D13B114BB
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x449C27CAEACAF04C897E5451ED484ABF
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0xE8EDBEBD44E82F6BC55772BF74EA4E9F
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0x1906F8159E0661B274EF620E60F5D967
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0xF576BBF5103A76F700009B64B5BBC292
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x037C4E121AB516F67588EB0C92989FEA
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0xC2FD454E7EABCDF895BE783DED735A52
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x3B21B4975D619BD3D0CD5E8ECAB26FDC
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0x87E3AA796A892EF405BEFE131EA42135

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x9806472061082F1A6FAD30D5E0FC4EB8
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x682A5BAA71157BAF8DFCF114A2E4E0DA
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x0ECFC7B826E434CC6387EC71A3CCEED5
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x901002E3F9C7E6417409C21FDB86769E
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xC4405CD96CFA3017B1E3A0E104C1E76B
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0xD8EF5B42F3A467C8401938E543A00582
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xAED3367309EDFC463B185442EC35F121
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0xBC75CC064A6168BAD2E0A156957194E8
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0x26D7372DDC072C1B5B6A5EA882E5AACF
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x66AD48E7D563C0B3000E38C0BF06997D
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xC2F516B67760EC1C8401BD29D6028857

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0xE42800C18E9AB8763518620E64F3203B
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x1B4F24F943F8E6B6C593D1C205FA627C
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xBC618DCB646CAAE087AC74F4EE3850AE
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x9C216816AAA40E8E3AA6D388136F44A9
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x6CB6191CFECCC7459A7EE67635D2D1CC
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x3941B929EF8CB4781B7B68FC49098F57
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0xFE23B6C4DA7171F5BF1273CED7F31358
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x0195015A075CD62314CD0915C39820A5
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0x9C14DD8406D0DF787B82D5C6F15F26CC
girls.
0x0F7E4865418EC890ADC2AC4E74BC6F55

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0xF88FBBCE600CF1D440A6B0CD45248FFA
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x58A99E5FE6BB5B6A5D6D2EA2B43BDDB3
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x12692991B97B13FC297317E541FD171D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Doubtless."
0x79E88D98FC36A78FA6B01964E644B03E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xC80CED80D3532120622C1867B84BBFCF
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0x556B6D890227A8C08CB3A94E5D3524AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0xD10E3318B2560B9BEB9DC6BFB5B93912
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0xDBB22A9F63B60739348901191129724D
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0xCA92EE32127BC0B5D35DDC50EE516E89
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x582B2DD4C20CF95BEB171E28AFEF9F24

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0xDF8B04A7BA7C77F4EEED4BDFF1008DCB
What are you going to do?"
0xC1ABF9B25F9D1267EA56B5293F613B13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xFCD19FEBEBF5AF607D8EB4A38D20E1CF
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x09E00291F7BEE90215EB3EB7743A0642

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do you want her?"
0x53AA324BAE1412D70274BCFE3A51D563

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x896765CB7EAF7A034C61600EB7CA8421
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0xE158188D6A1653F0C0CE828C24C9E85A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x0DAAC6920AB433C37CF435333CB2FA63
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0xC48CF5188F4D04A4147953D86FC352B7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x556B8FE4340837F1C2E4D13F4D91897C
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x4E522EE9AE859250B4F39C550E4C7B83

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0xE7AE179D4FA07B8842A21239DC4107F3
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x5408FC6CC3DE036A7C0734DE1502CBCE
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0xDD6AE9E723E807EA6B45BBDFCD645C53
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x515ED359ADDAA2CE17E57479559227DC
now?"
0x6449786E382E6C0715E15E745BCAE8D6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x9CBFCADECAA26430DD5B6FC8519C5CF8
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x2A4125F909F7F555D4ED57EAD8C2D2A1
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0x1F60992C52D43D06002B3F51A2A6C3CF
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0x92895F2A568ED61661B766D5DBF7118E
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x33608D02F77F66C4F2188CF5C2086D46
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x754FF85686460A2D0504C59E6894FB5A
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0x2D421A609745A98A63821144902940D2
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x39B55BF0C768AD36E9CE6DA25AEA8CF8
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x1F8FAC65CFAFC16FA807C7CF692240FC
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x8E44A410BDC9331CCFECC93B2C881EAC
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x9F30B0638F695101F819EFEC5DA97DA3
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect

state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x0BB5F9A462F6AAB7C6E8578427D29DC6
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."

that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0x3B504E32670BAD5217FF12D9028ABDC6
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."

the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xB12ABF68FBCF8763B9F8E5A0EB5F3A5E
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0xE9F0D3F4332AEED87DD7363B7B2002DB
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x1553722401DEAFE8B32299F878A177AB
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your

0x23A478D15704C8D4A476FD26B6EC8DA8
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x496F0D354979ECAA0C353654043AE08F
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x79D03C71253E7B52539D25C6D8DD0D6B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x930F2FD7C86EBB67E4CE7F4E4906E5E2
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0x8CECB468D85E4C5E99540D8CA5AC61A5
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0xECFF94AC1BC394AFEFC5B28D72D05712
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0xCB100621AC7FCED7A037788569B429B0
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0x067A7D242B001CC30F2B36869BB2D220
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x00811796F68436D842436D19CAFF0516
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0xEC85F92180D791A9E4227D225B5D7BE8
hear, Jane?"
0x1D6CF6A52537B0A6AAA9D99A5B7A0E90

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xB442DE4DB9E7F27B0F03BAF8CFC0769A
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x52AD62B2436205EBF132598D74FE737F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x83F638E80E271328511B73B6C9F9C72A
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x8FE6CAE7C23C9A4B4EEEF009CF765396
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x2D6965CE3805A33388472FFB08458FA3
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0xAAD97AD249D53B489EA6B9DB92A7105A
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xEF005903FE39A7891D30A5BC22F872D1
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0xEB89B3CFDCA41314F3A16F94A1AA9E11
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x5DA47933F64A4E78E12489B1F81B9F8E
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x6E6B56DE62E0D357CC35AE0F10CA4CD5
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0xC29A381BE3DB3A9707E0F5E9A91FE489
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x99F4E5B03A28EE1DCF9CD6CF4995DBA6
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x10DC86ECFA07F2B48FBBCB80BDE73DA1
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0xE6DAF1AE295ED3961CDA440590A5EBD3
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xDC7F6DC869D4D21A0C0BEED11963AE30
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x2F67EF4CA3067D410518175B2E3B20CE
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xD372B9F90968FCC6BE2673BBB0BA70CD
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x1A03C545EBCBC151C39AD0A63AB8CB1C
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xE6D932A2E46464BBB341E4C4F25EEDB9
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xD2EE4AE509DDBE3E9615A831DEB3232E
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x909F9D563E27F2D714107A1F379AF1B8
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x7B7C6FB30DA7E2B835E40DBD3D0F7B8F
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x2F05C59F0B39199D7D37F5922A69788A
without.
0xC0D7A51154256560D8FD38634E22F539

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x263E860B0D203DDA9DD6C32D5381763A
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x9615EF94BD950C744D98CF297E6AE498
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0x35F26197AE583489F8E534FEA03E877B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x3FE14CE2F09D6360FD7B20DAAF081CC5
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x1D80EE8BBED1B06AE71CEC48984CD6E9
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0x5629C8FD36C2D66E644B9CB3D2EA2462
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x2FE45AB69C18C704E889250C5E393617
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0xC6D4D8CC0D850FDFD60817A40B2A4F30
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x277F395FE7507672A27E21C768321408
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0xD16330E79A4E3DA0C9B46C5F3333B936
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x15762A8A78D01ECB8831DF9C76F2AE3A
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xE491FFA7179D796B23F3F359A21A5D54
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x46BF5EBC20969E73EBB5484522D6EC26
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x41EF26030CA29B8D8928AB60C9C0C488
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0xDC6771C16DED490BD97F72E6AD649668
improved aspect of his abode.
0x5442213B9268DF735A04BBD327B27963

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xB540E82B0B8872C26CE185EA5EADC595
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xFE9EA50F58AAAF510445586752773BCE
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x30A012CEEEAE25D4B6E787696282ABC8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0xDD90FF5FEDA01685BF419B7729BC4A6F
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xCA41AAE6146C8EA1EBABB4C6858F04DB
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0xC27BD3AA2C9BF924573D0042CCC3E118
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xE135B5A24253AFD2EB3866A2E3F9133E
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xF83681D1C8B43AE75736816373B0782B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0xC0D6E1503E3920FE5414B82ACE4A68E3
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0x7CBD26E2FAD99125F928CB0705EF315F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0xE619656CFCD150D0C724C769C5BFC49B
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0xB65F8C0083955BB9D263CC13A22347E2
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x187A81A3FA58E7D41708A57BFB85DFED
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x8E66BE539FBCD79DE8473FEC74E569FA
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0xE01BBC1EA94812530FA5655208B84F20
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0xF08A336F909DA798D2FA2DE677BA73F4
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x6031A97DA8C88C45F3F828AF73AB176F
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0x4494345187A58F00196FE9B971C41A01
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0xB3927AE72D375E746BA647B565BF0020
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x6FD0F60CE2C0EBAB11FD01613E3C6EE2
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xFD1BD09E74E0822F3AC204C94897E838
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0xAAE34D3CCA78D188FF8803A2ADB12305
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x4E61BDFC1268AFAD1A49B184C3A5A418
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x5D75FAB21BA3498C023F94F57979B529
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xF2013A2DC888176ABD25586EC5B18B5E
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x96CD9F2593F35D3D8D490646E835F535
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x8D61F15EC7E29BD2D374E0A1AD64D434
column, gloomy and out of place.
0xF061DEFA163373FADDCB3CCEF6DCA1EC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x46287341323B5D259B0FF4B7BE686C7B
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x663031D57AD373E22DA921641670D83E
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x553DE19106342CB43A1F191A1C4276C9
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0x41EC530312FB98A459D767BDB393AF44
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xE865A31BE3F8BA104423D3F305CCD826
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x6B0D848E4AD41CE3C048061FF73F3299
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0xA9B45A19302BE3F2418AB425ED3C99E0
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x1782CC35B1A106918160082107A66DFE
career--I see it now."
0x64B910CC97CE1617660E19C097B874D7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x1322FB3B5C23A731F8668001A1489EF0
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x1EFE05811E7968070DD63713C8F497CB
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x0A58FC9173D1CF4D498B41D06A73C889
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0xC3E5D0398572834305F793711DCE10FB
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x8929B5C69C8F4B67A4329169829977D1
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0x958F4614A18BB7D5D8CA35513D5C692F
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x73EE525AF8A4BA52C9858BC5FDD7B65C
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0xE81C3EA3F57D1E95B2770F8499E76F3C
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xC60F6264939F36B9114E60BA8A1C5003
into the house.
0x85801CA5A3C987F9822F5547C931CE98

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x72F21ECCC432B5F547FF84CCA25EFF3F
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x676FEAF9BA89A37E477B33E983D4694C
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x9DB5CCD4A0D02569D6B633DD6CF7577F
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x80F31EF9A3AF0FA312AD9D5DA7454A0F
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0xA7EB71FEA7502C9BBFABEED942EDFE00
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xBA84AE4DB6716D918D4185DEDD5C8147
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xBFC3B61CA18E895623D57BD05DEDF588
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x66AE0877B5FC1DC55340004E4002687D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xFEA2502703E15028C4240AD48A81B9E9
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x092C2C92F51315372FF89AF6EE5DBE41
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0x105C0122F358E5DA564B42E7013A3280
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x0C37AC1F97C08E8D42993297C0392EDD
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x928836A53153AE7085A43B931B6FBF70
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x64ADC11AC652C6873D44518BA1BE3EF1
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x0758792287AFC90CEF9EA592521D9096

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x333448A06D84976D181366DE371173E0
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x3CFF7609F7997648A206A1F163760D89
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0xF0A30FAC912E9CD06EE3C3355433CC1C
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x153C3F7BFFDC04F2C2DA9E21584FBCDC
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0x62C5369902BEC84BB8060C28B70826BB
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x4B5426502DD8DF6FB9E2C0029E182B05
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x5B7677DDEBCDA91C1767C446E0115D9A
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xE7CA370D2A0AF973BDBDDCFF40079C97
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x4E85679FD93BE513D59C2ED5D69FBCA1
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0xC747BE66ED525716AFA3E0F9FEDD60A3
mother, who was drawing away."
0x105140F75C343B6E4A7EC1CC30BB2694

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0x78A301098FDC6233577F74B936F9A9FE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x70CC02522727701D9FE104B3E1185080
the way."
0x25E9A583A2E8DD470F91699860927068

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Tell him I will go."
0x81EB76B5AB956B3955F5CDB3D444F47A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x7FB0F787B05D4DCD5A347605CF905818
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xB73E472FD69FC35A23DACA04646C7F9C
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x3A0B080EA0B46D9B1BA6283E22CCB09C
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x7931F26500EF93F5B7510B2DDA564595

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0xA5C0B47FD9888FAD1B8144DAA27140FE
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x4089BBF3B04795BC1AEB29E8F67BBEBA
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0xB327EEE554E1566A2DD572633A733B4E
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0x66CA5766CE31D9CD978509793A51B858
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0xFD7DD8A7ED1389F192D3077E865510BD
with himself.
0xB64B996CBC0FE14E86DE370154FCB26A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x2EF9C0E588E6798D794F61B56D023ADC
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x288FC4411894372D2F9215206F9B356D
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x7A8C7DD0199B0C9A24EE51C1A5BDBC6E
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0x643F099931835E29937753FFEB52E5D5
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x598588279AC61270008921E3A767F511
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x86CEF8DA581445691B8FEBAA110BB8DD
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x3D3715D5134E8C0A60A34B4E507C01A8
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x032264D16492C8F9CB7A3D47199F8AE4
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xA299C44D800D28C35B4DA7CBA8D0A06C
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in

One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x25153E21AD41158361D3E781B72694AE
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0xF4FCE0E3400B5AE93FDF3BD36ADA9A59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x89603F7866619CCB477FA66F6E7BB934
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xEC19F898465AA040170C534E5D51D11C
ensuing year.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0xC39602232792C50A10C4E15F2A9DB4A3
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x73518BCA85C0AD15A05702BCEAFC2EED
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xBF63CF86B840852A86F0C20422DF4F37
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0xB8B5A9ABB8E7300857F373ABA5320334

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x4ADFA078F94A49E6C01F2FB14CEC8BE4
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x14EDA4C876BDA31C00D5363A12572292
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x86BF8B91B3FDF5A990A7A01DB8AD3CC0
yesterday."
0x490AE66B7C8235971ECCFD8F82DEDF9F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x2A6D33103898323CC79D891DB834EFE1
he was serene as glass.
0xC300C221714EC644591CD439B0FC0923

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x536CBE1062D26EF84DA239FC1479F782
known each other long."
0xCB3B0B23CF9C81A44ED760B9FCE5FFFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x5F8EEA06FB8CFD5999B2B348EFFFF8FF
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x2EFDA7469F371A5A7F83873D0DEF5EBC
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x44A5AAAD4ED97186BCE3E94AB173D37F
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x5A11F46F5FF0A00F1AE0CCE4D2266517
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x6C3E751F8C64ED7EF1CEB481AF1D4CCD
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0xF48ED4F9B9720C234D2996CEDBF37DF5
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x7CC48F0F830E2C0BC9F2B376C1EEC16B
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x16A7C66DAA3187561933B5B169A5A773
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x8F4B59D9F2A129CEA8A3DCEABB36FDB0
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x93147B72AD8FEC1334730EC36B98416F
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0xAF4CCDC1ED2E0A645F920F980D3132F2
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0xB4DE84497CEA0130FA4012A56CB75AFE
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0xC1423E73B374626E7762B2B1BC85683C
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x87ED4B8927F8B98F190124E07AF135F6
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x384D0D76D08F829140CE6EDD8F4B2642
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x8AB00CFD0B9B47A19F14ADD33B94DBA6
frigidity.
0xD7292AA0EA03676B6B31BEDAE9FF64D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x71C9896EC95DC70E441DEC96EBEA26AD
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x8FA239AA903862898749031FC25EA935

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x5F94B8E77FEF8CB6D3F183CE6E5A1E13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0xB4B4636E6BEC8D5A0AD881F26426CC71
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xFEDD86D9957BA291A056367E72CFC175

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0xEF1666B5F22BF002F63399148EAABFE7
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0xDCA70A47876F38C8CD9A58441F194C88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x1A899A54F7863A4699E73E24D38931EB
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0xA2583E81DE18DA480957E9716FAC4077
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0xC5F24F52D580D0298765454D8BF738DF
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x9A97676FEE82D2EA56D580056395EAAF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xA25A08E8B63F1FCC1C6231249D4CB15F
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0xB843FD02F2C515867D728BB23B6DE87A
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0xEB08131D6929DBBF1C01BDEA6CDF204A
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x9EDE30D02965B0D56F3CFE0F3A27D65A
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x60FCCDFABB8050485339CE31A1352DC0
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x484E73081B0E81EE866A59FD4816C1DA
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x2D3B22EC719A65DBCE5F9BC3CAAEFECC
plans.
0xD140691B44A4A7170CC42597FD783564

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x8646419239A773C8B1137AA7C24B2DA0
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xDAF2C1010CA55E0218027E2CAB53F4DB
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x812EB39C51888CEF1A077EC04656EBE5
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0xD7863D5DE7D6F73D226DC87310CADC52
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0x49C17619A60D5EA6DDA64095CAB5ECE4
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x5E282C331C920009AC9D882FAA455A44
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x6B3F918D976E3E724CF0F17922868FF7
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0x1815BBAEE858442860F8ED19BE4DE66B
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x2EE07D5108EFC924A4BF4E6AD69FDBCB
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x8D18260F8D9A59BCC7023FFF066B4D8F
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0xE3FF3636696F2DD04A63572989AAFA22
the task without regard to the elements.
0x81A01E058E7C44E8B40B49E05F0627F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0x8D25F4CE01B267DB32E0D193F448A041
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x57691005C663C75C1D30CE1C2527E0E1
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x8E045C7282AFF6ADF66EA0BEA3CE2118
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x0F3D9865AAD61A4F2C8B26E8A3533A4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x5A4F869F8D774A0101B31F42DD2BC50E
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xE4D27C35D78111A9390FADCF284A472F
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x29AD3C3B9CF989003B0B7F26ED719D08
was a special annoyance.
0x18AC565AC0B2A61C436225E913B3499D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0x602D766A6A5D70BB264D98CFA0E146E7
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x94F1A59E8A46DE16F5A9325895DA2C41
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x972568CE8D700E01252A6419C3729080
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x8EB7E5870C62A254D50400FBF14C9C87
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x3A6B7D8B817485571426402C4120D7F0
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x3D09C3E111612AEAE4BF0DE3645EFAED
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0xC255FC5A9EC32DF4380F763B7D4BE242
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0x83BF4BB25D53597CD565083F1AD0437A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x680C0CE525BE14FD5D8364237A3EF496

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Learning German."
0x860714153F6AF92815FAA5751D6BB1F6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0xE6D5C9051FD48D4E592152D55A299A5A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are not in earnest?"
0x406F088CA14B5B38A11990C3A3DD1803

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0xCD863873BA05EA28EA26DBBBC7FAC708

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x233C167A218B937BF7AEEF2F8F94633D
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x0D635ED3EE7A33C16A742842514D6F63
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0xF7DB57DC4031ECB3A119FAE8AC9B9386
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x7C0DD7AFC2B2F7AA2332731F5D0FBF2A
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x8E27A70C19EB36C3AAE6D64BF7E4B855
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0x04CA441E599B8329ACD3CEEF5F90D172
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xBD5E3CA33D26C33AD13C126BD6D09FB2
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0xF067B9F9562ED1F680180C47DEE8468D
barely three months to his departure.
0x37F43BF970C5810428402280AD28AD48

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0xF56A9C78E268ACFB867B41092187F38C
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x6AB0B2D683E30BD903620D70BEC04599
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x99F451B07BE1A0F68303CDCBB371455A
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0xF8EB1D95C967FD3B61E0DF3330227E5C
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0xDE393F7D933291BE51DE79EFE6AAF1B2
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xB905912F8E73DF46FE5635F18BB6D438

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I know it."
0x4CA3D46D0EE710017219A6C58CCDFC1E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x4E493717585874E8D65717CA8D4B2E6F
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x99299C837DF4F1A80F0211340E6D698E
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x0AD7BC50F08D612B0BA30B4A3F605B74
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0xBCD0742D8CFE90FCB844A5926C332848
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0xC2FC953A451411786E3D536678A19BAF
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x275449FA714308F43F70AF60C9F0578F
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x385508019130613F1FD38E8B8171ADED
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x1DA2970365B428BC6A95F4BCA9890FB6
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0xEB87D8B13FE2CFA5B260AB4C10529417
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x3DEE2CE62F213D9D27B577E34F181735
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x2190D03EC4C31C92C39F823A3B89F26A
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x7E6F7F9F8F1608C88527B02CBA092284

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0x1DF8481EBFFCD8AF21ADAF34F12C27E4
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x9B5D475032EE1C7329BB34CA795F1C21
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0xC63CC003B9B640593BCEB4D217BA377B
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0xE9515B288A82689EB35321119F36A4E4
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0xB4B6185C866C922ED0AEB8F9AB74730C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0x18F6A2B2BE7C0970E120A7D01EC77806
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0xC5004C5A6A88593DE9692981204C60FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0xB67D58E9AA22D7C84DFCF5DEA4CA10D3
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0xA34025B3C73912C5E036419110936008
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x1CEC8C082608C4C49516D7F8260E8D66
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x53332A1994E3D8755DD807B980F5D772
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x67BA3B28BDF6A8633AE51D348BE5FD4B
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x1D8AFD4830D3994D6765098765B59DB0
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xC91452E6F5150574D06152DAE037E71E
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0xBA8AE1A6D602E9F7603F2F0AEA1E76C1
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x11E366E144E04F43F5EA5EADC53AEF63
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x91DADFC5CFFA4A0F6FEABE2512E631D5
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0xED93B971D61EA3498CAADD4E34E5D194
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x53266C640C742E8B1783911AAB6D6080

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x43931E8EC4931D57ABBB63F675E33AC9
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0xCBCF42C6A8175061DE9C68161FC321A4
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xC92C30AB4E894314298726CF13BB02F5
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x11E18B056236E9092526213C4092D77F
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x390080471F90CE88FE1ED75163A3F0BD
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0xCE75786C80C98F1A294F35E8AEB0888A
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x4BD85D05E2E15EE87F9472055953F788
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xD9696C2B7D7A5B149820653AE2A8B1D4
own.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x6D962EFF3AC639D508B74E91CAC465E9
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0xEC4DA92F32D58BB357C539F090DAC6CE
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x31093719C6E3E664F7D2E12F40E67206

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x8674CC6013E81D3DD2E3B30E194A9C62
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xD3F773B0CAA96C2C669087880EEA3E37
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x2B685ACF7089A54B98597D50514D0121
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0xDCF7DAC6F39EB5916735DBBF47232204
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xC97EDC4DCF5741AB5A7F79C01FC07F3F
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0xFA27960543722985D5D6C1FB99F4B6BC
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x0043C845D32004F6A31440A803345295
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x270EEB72437730AACED7CBFD9BB89D5F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x0194A79A2002D38AB0FFE83E6CC8B9D9
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x7393D09D1C353243A5211A961C63F49D
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x2974506A5E2F222E3431384F22840D9C
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x7B63D9C9EEADC0C7949132A6E86C860D
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0xE743264CE6832962AF3282E140F227B7
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xCA95678D1710E308632485E5BA2D0920
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x22918FB413CFF480DFB92105013B84EA
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0x2C136E217F832A777D0DB231896A9BA3
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0xEA1E19F945604BFF1F61DE39FD535783

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x1E81FE5921C45C3F879DD66C1DAB0997
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xA1C87DA5C1D72F84CF0DEA5754E2F037
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x581F55FD226E84D95CFEAE61007C3DEF
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0xFAE98D19962E1AF7FE8330D2665114AC
then I felt dark indeed.
0x9406F07B2AE5B25DCC1220836918898A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0xE08317E9B5EA800A20A8D955CE9D693F
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0x798E02A1E8E37BA5CED040D358CF701C
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0x7D5AD4C0B1424E65CA5BC1922D30881F
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x05ECEDC4F70DA72CDA995EE34CFFB27D
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x3A7FD11152E3748F1BFD82DBE88963AF
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0xDD4F2C31D3489A6130D74154C7ABC302
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0xA4238C8F706A9E6BF8750891558BE872
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x4521B074F7DE27DFF2CB07B2FAA41989

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x98140D133269112A6C52464DCB73A722
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0xA64C05EE0CE2B63DDA9C2BB8BF384F7B
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xB3A1929CD9C158D4BF4324DB173526B4
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x48D3E41ADEB56F71B5DBA538F24F82C1
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x88B0FB91E93636B9867A89074AED6E4A
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0xA861C6A38BCE423CBF12E81FD837B1BE
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x2B0045E9F967657276690648972C5695
eyes filled again.
0xAA4715DEC9F11358241C17A7C0F8B641

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0x572C0139A4F292B486FACAA69AA4C947
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xED2592CB5A38F892D3C575DE27A8DD2F
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0xF05631A79AE2E5B0F32A39FB4241774E
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x34A79FACC560FDAFC98CF747A96D6F44
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x029EC4F88A2858D204AC9D1F9C12930F
as to its cause; he only said--
0x6058D8550F5FC625902C5DCC94D42002

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0xD5A466D01C4F6B8F0751AB995A54D8EB
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x39EC39F26925448D4182E07E6BBFC6F0
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0xAA8746269F40B123BB8E9E9BABF6876C
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x10513208C32D0F7CCDB62707B6A0F97D
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0x72B327453460BD0224CD932F7CA75893
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0x4FCE240AE1D445E3B9CC61C57B81264A
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xBF0E3BF28BA7B8A4B4F4069A2843E90A
said--
0xDCF95D24795728D92DCC8E0069262D13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0x166AE0C1518181C622131099534165A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0xC660EA14507835A92E5F96AC6C7A7F4F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0xC9FE17E2BDB197BCDADED28FEDB20657
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xB8BBFCE788A1A2FCD6B68A79365D9754
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x335F4B9F21F57FC54C01035130C50B76

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x14E76837012397A26F6274812166034C
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0x4A2AEB6538EF8544A0E7545D8CE9CD81
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0xEF128AABADC5742D58526E2EC9A5DA13
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0x659882C5AB0B4E2B2526A558D0932E7B
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0xC9F19A2F13F7DAAF1382F9C92E7B53B4
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0x05F0251EF92EE584B96BC596F3FB49D4
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0xE387E773E4E2BC13E140CE552B18614B
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x20CCDF8A9D7349EF09FD0DBF1122738B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x2D21E8EEACC3686C422ED8F52C0200D5
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x983BD4639891D02831CF747F149B8C01
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0x372C0A0F18051DBB98F5E8B6AB33163C
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0x2B184852D4EDDA5BE0CC95989A2170DB
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x67A356E996FF72B0B41D1B4E08BE2E7B
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x16AA5278E4347C74B672445635B0A147
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x63B23FFD8FDAECD457F141B47D182EC1
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0xCF00C262DD6B52369454918D2D7512C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0xBAD546277D2F1AF172526130DF0EC716
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x922BBE83E2F25D652A7E60ED425F912F
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x5FDCB5368B5268BC8EBE05AD1DC6EC20
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xD22361B04154FAF53C066FE4A7399DC9
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x6ECEDC1EB476B97E14BBCAE83F67D90D
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0xEC2518C8C89C80B7DB38C4F03FF2E7A4
last refuge for silence.
0x0C9C717240B9FCFFA7A5BEB7ACB71400

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x4E2CB213517B8DFDA7449A9C0B11C11C
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x5AC55BBDC9A8934A8269D8D2C183F624
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x5035F169494F56EE3325728D9B78E690
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x7D9A01086FD1BB314257A10E7EA42888
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0x2995960080D857C6B8C782F2F04919A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xF53E94C5FC840A2F41E40A1BA2042F24
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0xBEC398D4A8CCE9C0E0CA2D43E50A5585
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x575CE31A18F6F8BAC277FE8CD08B2DE4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0x892B13A341DF10946AC8817FE8E3F4BD
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0x566C408449DFED1CCC9736F57E5327D3
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0xDAEE953812CEB45DE7F1E26E73D81C32

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0xA3664CECDED5AB79EC3E9D65378B0343
sails on the 20th of June."
0xC7360C3477B0E010365F737A9AD9F56E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x1FD347B685828862BD836D768E85200A
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x31D7A8902209A0A0F6B29230CB17F410
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x295120F0AFFC85F61FB091B6C064CBA3
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xFF5F66DD94813755AD054E0C4EB12D90
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x5A2D61FE6C2029D37374D72802909AEB
same enterprise."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0x0B05E2502D9D058CE73D00FB4C3FCBDA
to march with the strong."
0x4E6EC63054AB9C6C19D8CF9FFE59F4DB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x966EC7277ECC63F8C62F62759DEC221A
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0xC70D96E88EA71EA63E3917548EE49AA6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xF341D207760C83437EEE856BFA6ED3C4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and

exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0xE522470839856CFDD8619CE1B6838A80
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0xC02898C1EADCE1DC0D26D92ED0BA9B08
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0x3FE532B84C01AE1D25C077207A1589E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be

the first to inform them of it?"
0xE83632A674880D7BF71B60A43453C005

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x02C144B9D652619911C7F12D3641AFA8
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x3A763CA088538BDDE24BE149EDE59D1E
rivet the spell.
0xA832108D7D77EB763A2D6F55095AB27C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0xA0251C2100C48D3CDD6B722576623162

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xF6A9C1554009442F8FAD32ABBC3A3BD7
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x5A5D521C136F376AE657F61A3EC12576

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xD51248A7D2C0DB054311AB7529521431
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x37B594B8CBCF1F7CF3D7594AF83A5952
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x080AB0632A1FFF9D3110D97A75785531
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x0024D7A36E99526CC81D86AC6A6254D1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0x1912A28C7BE6A711610E95BB18699D65

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0xCAF3AFC4B01585B8C3EF8285112C4A4F
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0x1EB734EF001B58DEDA35E0E7D3F8411D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0xD50CD9BA9F5A85D84C696F664546E874
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x385C512AE9A55BC2532523F84B346FDA
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x5794F7C2D4CCEB86F8F4312F05680A48
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x6F5CE12C8D350244AB82D9F3CE8A3681
service."
0xD59E1F9E83E8396DD618685EF8E84423

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by

them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xF0470256AE4774E53DCCC67BA81BA345
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x2C37C827486466ABAC9FF03EA8C0C0F1
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x8A50151E8413D99D74FD73236EA0A7E9
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0x879802018F6CBCE17A748A45CF4769BB
for him.

"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0xBA2F35DDB1C754A7FB4BABC2FD4B7612
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x7AAE8540806F63E7D375B53B99D1A34B
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x6C00D5A630E98B865301040CDB1A7B83
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x28E5BE5E0DC5A5D26FB53B96E8394AEC
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x873A73880B28F7B51A425821245E926C
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x749D5770DD36026EC2FB454F5CFDC058
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x9448E83D73EA7B239B64B7BE37E5C80E
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x6F93B4079E49B39ED3EF3937FC3CFDBD
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0xE35DCBC29B2C1A58A15BC6FC4F0D8FCD
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will

rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear

"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0x574B585ABA5CD1DA55F9D8EEEF9F87D8
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x1D73268BA9209E14E4227F448A761101
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x02F974462010BC6AF513D026B1B84B8E
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0xD71A3B764747F3537D56D1A0573B840F
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x93B54A7B9818CFA5A116E86176F1BB50
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x98311F604D0174B7C91B1AFE42F5D6F6
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x5AB13EFBE8AB43D5ABFCA46BEAF3702E
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x55B5F02937F9D55BDFBBD3459A18647E
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x8148EC24AFAC5B905BBB24D6DFF74392
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x282744B3F791EAC9B412D7F7F54922B1
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0x790ACFCBA788D7BF1F001C8739D5AB4D
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x3B4B0B888B96687769AACFEEA8619CFA
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0xD2B5E85AA15A54500B05F4171ADABD7F
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0x1A426BAF0C1C941F8EF0F28C9F972734
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0xE210893931286668455B4B7B65B3681B
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0x56A2BD4737FFF5E500F5C8595C1756D6
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0x1FE2706117A87FA0A34FAF8E01936E88
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x1A5C29786482DE73A969E3C03EFB6E25
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x12DC5AAA7446BC606AE584DCA539890D
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xC00C39A8F86F3FC8B6364DA536A9F616

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure

step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0xA69108A547703D4A686F6A04F43C807A
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My

work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0x3CB0AA262E07954CFA5710B665962317
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x7E4FE0F4E75F9A8BC1587DE2B72523F4
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to

think, before I again hazarded a reply.

"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge

that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0xABB0978276AD71EAF18013A1F4C3CD3E
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x6ED553F0160D7F15A97FBCE57907E31E
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0xFA1B3511B9D466F72D5B4F425FE8D69F
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x0F2F2DEB0A996623E3ABB81FFF6E4D59
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0xE3C0E1005438A8D0FF9FA5CD0DE78FD3
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x3A78A1C7A999B90722451DF2EA5614BC
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x97F2A43011ED8101941FE7CD73D6A513
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0xD99887502C5DA31DE262FDE70381E489
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x6E076444DAC730B6D2FD7EB3CA015506
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xF1030D03C0F25A5F6B18FA2DDADCDBF3
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xB873BB2B10283916AC17EE2C62F4DE49
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x8D67903CB415CB426EFCA0A9FB7E1A6C
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x0412E64A3FE59F5AFEC8BC5127B39F5E
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xE20C9B0249D0615EE2B3B4744B6EACC4
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x0F5269830E5E83972A5ECE2A5A18E181
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0xA6C4BCE54BF114F81DC653FA8F960466
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0xAA084883C3C1F76D6198B42F70F47DF7
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x7CF512E2E4C6242AAA60AD46E03D560A
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x6BFEAF59D7A3F6A1FF8FCCBDE268C052
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x8251002B44C2F6CDB2A56A38CD7D64C9
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x98F975D23F8BD706350EE007C719A83D
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0xA560E2D2E852042BCEE224A0ED0688C9
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0x59E774463209C670F05ED3442B4ECD30
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x1DE943C2F736E1277E2E19359208F8A1

"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful

item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x2EF6707C7A03EFE99385426306185F75
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x9F8B35C6F5F63A74467DE814912977DB
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x6F4C0603CB1C6D6CD37CB6ECB9F11E81
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x9E8A1DD083CE18C54752B383C834E92C
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x8C3E49B05E82A6E5BABE98E0EF6E2E76
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the

bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would

scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xDC83EF8D74A38AE5F9EBAD11A5634084
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice

made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you

were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x1BB375A64C417B71253815C4F39A8760
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0xDF540B87A21CDA1797F90443B2A768A3
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x756E31F8D289B10A62A43289934A4173

I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0x659E2BF240D33429DAEFD5EBA28E0CD4
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0xE2AFF6464408B9FA8B1F3151CD7A990E
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I

would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you

0x2D1E825F38122D73B0DBDDE25C875694
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x0568ECDA3BBB38B093D8EC0B19C3B41E
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have

great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that

is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister

might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can

0xDDD057D722CAF90E622B5C77B8DEBD95
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x42DB70D8DA054B8E798F7206166BD2A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0xF3C4B5BE75A4937032E4643D0D2C7748

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x912881EBC876F51581616DDC83025A41
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x1C8E18C67A842ECE399F5766BCA07382
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0xD92B6A2A10AF8709AAAFD2993A287D8E
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0xFE763E3740E8823E72EB8E39998D8970
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x925F2615070F685BBBC6619A7FC97D58
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x65C9F120F5B7BF3D7B4A48424BC0AC49
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xD2A5CD4F07BD329E3B29DB906F468CA0
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x645419E49C29AD03F6C304D04FF62487
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0xC6E35E04AC07503E6E76D7807F93492E
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x2BBBAC2CFB1E8CCFAFE547463E48748F
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x0F79ABA6A646CF3305935BEEE01401CD
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x4CD7CBAC456489DE6762ED5D4E130261
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xE259353D26CAC981AF39CA5C3C3E6CFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0xD4C6942306F069DEEDDBD87D0D1BA1B8
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x9F848037C0EC0B93399E0BDEF2172986

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0xDFE30F6B1CB3976F5A9375E1812E5815
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0xDE500F6B27917E0B5AFBB9EED1A081B9
this signify?"
0xECC733D4E72710BB66C1A14053ED862F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xC5659B7B37E371158F59EDDF608864A3
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x7FC86643DA88DF02C66E9EB049B292E5
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0xD38028327AE7E7CDFC199DA740B82F88
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x687983AB5AA046652F8FB4D8B0852E38
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x268DEEFA893262DF22D2B6FA8E8E2472
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x3436F86876AEB03E63E7255CDC6AED04
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x69A031FF28BF44A5BC56C0D797DBD4C3
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0xE8FC43D1367E68A17B836E225A426327
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xB99501083DC5FF3DA26B2A5C0A26FA99
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0x0CC85E24D3BA2673600A39B5D02A13A7
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0xA9B8055724A1BFCFC2620DDDE09E5331
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xAA8AB8E38E6655809111B6AA634790A4
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xD7B3D37BEFDF35CFEF493163F9574C78

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0xBDFBE97CE3D32FCD838D09AEF8C05B16
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x12A7D731DC17558771C6A97594D9FA87
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xF2F404A31AFB1E341BB4DF6127583724
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x5D55BD4B50DDDA0537C41F1DE44FD4BB
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xF7799245A092D622FCFAEFEC50A4A310
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0xA7485C68145B8495B2E251445E63664A
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0xD04AB73BE3C6E991DAA680A5AD90A632
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0xF9D5C0A47F3213E4FF1D8DC1BF43FACB
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0xB6827DFEA1FA394719213595C888C3E9
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0xB8A8AA37B83DCD8592AF565916AB659D
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0xDFFBA21FB7A322DD2C61B171E6FF8A47
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xAADEC2887A7AF485A70DBAF3C9AE1821
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x98883E2DED6C1AFD0979E908ED6F97F6
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0xBD5C44EDF4F3926A3DC2F1764262DFBB
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0xC7C33F2AF6F0C6CA8D6D466210886EF5
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0xB38A9166DD9856405155E66ED91AF4CE
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x4267768A5E87FB0537CE4CAD11B17D61
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x221B702037EAC9108A57FE8A76392896
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x6AC6B3F917E103A453948C76475D1C59
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x28843C07277E0F55DA2B90D4AF17DAE9
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x24B58078ADE8F2A7AB0B160410426EE2
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x28245AC41DE88F741917B0EF7CB0F993

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0xDAC886626FDB9565D1E6FC115D9C3692

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x6977D42C21C920520D1DE86C87B7C413

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0xCB4ED552703C832343345186ECBF8B1A
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x06297756E0871CCE855F32ED7820088F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xF1C48F816384DC789D1BF2C4A89B7FA8
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0xEA4FEAB816C7408259920102A444035D
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0xE26111FB452F90EE362A0775B9B30193
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x901E8C70CA9012106E33FFB8A5078C3F
tribes--and unwed?"
0xA479D869316BA28849942C49720897BD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0xA82E80C964976D28CC835FF322D6213A
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x19FA74B006B28AE9655F8CDB31B06F0A
yourself."
0x50B661ADFEE95577F7802F4F6F95B20C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x96960D67CB2687E19FB69A57CE2BBD3F
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0xB13185374E5100E1728CE7940395AA15
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0xECEBFF074DCAE5194DB69729F169AA0A
heart and--it would not do."
0x8BDBD7CBAD412C8B3D1C9504A3EDA1AB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0x9CA8138909C89F11D0A75E437DEAD9CC
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xA60238F53A4334509EA88924A82F2866
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x13D44AE3EA93332F3F189745B157C978
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0xD0E2195E526C6FDB75B577E11FF75E18
nothing more--don't fear."
0x139A0C200C2EAD067309C14ECACD49CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x0104CC4B82D68E10A3BD1A49C29516BE
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0xF39097BC5B0FE4B6CB537401E1C1AFC3
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x5ACAF1B844F195C710D6CEB0CB1274CA
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0xC54BBF1861E50E97B5534A94F0EFF69B
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0x40D6960CB2DAB919A6F0F5916026A6EB
eyes."
0xE64AC79DD4AB035900B01C1BC6D64FA3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x2E42BD2F6299FEFC903C5528787F4B9E
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x1B7966F4655DDA2DFAFEA4A558A62A00
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0xF2540523121DF84C4B916572973D4DD0
offer it."
0x70E1ECF2952C29F8DC43523A4F2E8DB9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x0703179A1FEEF93E0D929D9798FCDD66
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x4EC065D904CD06A0EB8CE42FF584AA66
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x1E8B7C305A8A0EE0E362712BA328393F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0xDEA57993A8DDF98E0A411DE7DF046E59
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x85F95B80B39FF3191898A67F3360D3C6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0xE71A3E1DF50FDB6A9AEC77AA6965AD8C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x09080AF5A405EF99C3474A37A8E8EE3D
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x89B31CB3D0093AAD29C2127A218AA828
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xEE4C3E086C2242480F4726F1EF02C7DF
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x792EAEF1FE4E897F26B3AC05919A74D3
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x76A66A7788EA70E0F10EE150E5B54802
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0xF13930C60110B8E0D2D3D34F6283741D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xF4C596D4B47D5A6583DE7C891BC10BAF
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0xFF08B01E9516B67ED92ED47656EC5C1D
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x8DC7E65A571674F7FA25A43C79D24F89
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0x05134377AC4DDB989F4AB4BDA89A8520
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0x10C141ABFB39A52459C70F2CBF3FC64A
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x38A217D506C876C5410A6F62EEC7B7A3
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x1030E9D3BF14449EB1F37480A6C4A97D
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xCD2A856223A5490F6D70681EDFC4BA5E
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xFC39B950C2850155285EC6463D69FE02
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0x57E3B93231DE0865B241D717279AD40D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x11E938F16091F4D2C8853984350612AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x6BBAF3001A9DB2B7B6B946BE9D095A92

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0xF817C4F43AA805F8F9DE840754A1F927
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xC524520EAC57A13087E4BEDB78A43AB6
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0xC3DEADFDEA8D0FB38BE268FCFB254F5C
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0xFC21B95618CA37FFD24B50F0848D1F0A
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xFCA03A0D7DCA8A27DF9AA976A469BBDF
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xA62901D71B06E06C5C53EB4BE1554762
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x52DD6D67542A8BA16DCB6F2F122BDE58
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x20EE36589491FD6B3371973248E697E5
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xD04E9185331237E4A77EC3E530A660EE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x87CFBAED2E9746097467A9ECD79187F8
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x4D4558974B4E9C67CFBCDF2DCD9E4247
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0xE8F98892FF6C7DA435F42A27D8F95D0B
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xF50FF8515C9CC5B7257105AE1F94FDFE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0xD0257B084ABA9F406A39500BBC50F770
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0xA76038529B4145C7C4D77309BA8FDD3F
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xBC554E00398D5A504489A0620DF6F126

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xDF4791545061097757BC17DEECD9E639
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0x460BE89267D6EFF80581695301D959B7
stairs.
0xCD6A9461E322E856D3D6C38A1F200A6D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x84DC1FDF19FAB7D1F240952DF237B597

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0xF47494BCB7B735BC807B194FBB20CEC3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x63A2F033F1D9E2CFABB394BAE2F95D3A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x094DA9943C369CB1946E1022A7AE48C4
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0xED6980D30CB18A3239368969F7486896
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x9FDEDC20231BA0854C0AC66F00469F1C
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x8B91F4A64939C392B3276BED427D02AC
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0x23F1342E878091D2DD016D212B9331FE
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x27C5C622D0815339E1AAB7740382A039
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x9FD791B2D40C73C6C5DD564684EE44D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0x84699CC73C5FD9AAF4EC822A8D47E3DE

CHAPTER XXXV
0xC93B09C7252F3B87B64629B13B5DB855

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xDFBA875FB53E0C0178BFBD4C6CEC687F
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xA1715B9E8530D058BCD4B430424DDF60
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0xD5AA2C0B7F214E7003C8C3AB8279E7C9
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x2116F92329B7A4A1226F10E769B74F7C
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x48FD8EC501BC3A59B8F9B4AB940E5A8C
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x67FADA96F1487E63D0A6B6BEC6497873

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0x7A366BF8612EEF9FAE63B5242E111A93
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xE6DE111EC2B82CDDBD41362046BED65E
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x8193372655156E30678FD86299FB9261
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0xEF48561999390874BDD4CD32F3BDB28F
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x7B8AC03702CFC9649593DD26126010E8
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x5BF62E847046F9B9FA444535E836B1DF
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0xC26F407AAE754986C24F8734FAF4DDB2
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x70F2FA2B4EBFA52A8F3874799A1E4B23
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x2CC227BA88D52D589E25E029234B453E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x6AFEEF8A7DDF63CE27466FBB773E31E6
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x840754A614CA422298160A69F517BD2C
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0xEC9DC41C236A58900FC887A4684EDA4D
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x630308EED19960D569D4219CF73250C9
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x336D011B8982F34C239B7611B2592A7C
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x38FE2A91EFB1EF16AA6CC8761BD7D569
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x54E38F69B65EC974F584F1B0168D5C2F
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xC2A10B94BFD4C13FA2A7748F8AACB91B
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0xEF75C5DA14B9AEF6049931C82FD9169B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x5CFCBCE2AE2AD112E4A9CF09B572081F
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0x2509D481455715DBF7BAECAA086E8854
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x179594E479E274865B8C6CEB7F74FF56
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x252885C70F4CF84494B1C0F327398612
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x862C91C99C264E615743AA2B0FA95E28
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0xF652FDEFB6DBD11016960C50D1D598D3
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x9D6F199103834BD1C4D6418C936463A4
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0x3180B0DF8143958B8DF2AE67B8A4DB3A
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0xF941E7E2D175480C43B2D3FACA5E1903
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0xEAADABCFD2DCAB2D94D22ACAE5C6A18B
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x2F87A2AC4D6564042330046563FF20D0
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x9F93DE50F705CBDB772A0A26AA0E9931
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0xB9D994A02E9D5D385E4A632413589A7E
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0xE0E976E72389B7BC48B13CD23A7F2F7E
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x7221DE0753016D39ECBE7EA970924F13

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x4E97B557D1BA7EED4BBB2984185B26E4
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x704A8970013081B40FEB0D7CE4B12173
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x77D4F152FDD596100F8179022164C338
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xC53FA6F741A362CF4A45EDF4B795DEE4
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x6966243C64549C9B034145229D283612
spoke to the point at once.
0x2F9FB1B0E13DEDDB8629860E309A7638

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x5680650D2ADD70CA4D21BDEC7BAE9808
friends."
0xEA9B5BB96CF8CE799DBB796AF7D293CA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xE9CABF7525F93EF52CBCEC5EE370D6D6
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x766645EC51B2F302FEC5F2D29B43FCD8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x159BCB55E28EE71B1E9E449E91099323

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x69EF6103A3C30C6CCAC51C45FFFBBD18
good."
0x633447224DB867F257C97F14D2A83F52

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0xA985C0D080EBDA48E574C96C6158150C
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x23868AB2D3A1B790F5CEFD466868AFF1
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x2DD674372BE86BC5189BD86B5D4CE694
strangers."
0x9EACCE818F11D06C1FDD357FFACA0543

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x460848399A4BFA4573EE0524FA713D3B
regarding you as a stranger."
0x6F9C900B36DCC2CB30A95C6F95442605

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x3BD83AB2C8C3616463658A354DB313DB
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x17178EBD470C364E17B759D7D3625750
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x8B0CB61B631461C0B11D750FDA0919CA
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x103F70C2B27A7583410C3C6229C83BA1
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x3D160453B14A8304F7FFFA1E58FE3A0D
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x91D21B3FBB19C6C73754380E63E84173

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x295720B2A46C146E501BBB2BA60ADC2D
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xE1F451C32C538EEFBC81AB8BFC50797F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x8B2F85E471BA260B6A742CDDFEEA5EBA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x59C48B90F4E5CA4C83A02E7E8FFEAF2F
India?"
0xE4BB3709B082C0BD2B3E31DCC1654C33

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0x2E872066C4076043DA51025CADEFB444

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x15865D71DE8331A0938E9CEB07C5F2C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x31DBF0A59CF8F8A529B5FCACE35D012A
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0xC2993066FACE1726BC2BF4F8B52B5648
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x88D51B3B4808D10A6937BC3AC2EA3D61

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x1EE2D320D07E5F6C0CC419A47769AC4A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x7FA4A0724DCC96B4BAF11304672DA791
crash down.
0x80AD4C5891D64BE03F07F25D6C3D8340

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x84881262F7B27CCB6128DCA95C38A87F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0xFA9952825EF87B5B5DAD06301189B855
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xCC817BFC2CC2CD8D885756F75591C8B5
You are killing me now."
0x9F0C5E78B8D9F50B803B6DF9BD2388F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x7866DC01E5C659C65C73B0B050AA8D70

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xC7B7E84A790C6CB1D36AD979F361F6E5
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x5D1B889778FE8BA91DD099A5DB10ADA5
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xDEB0C4EB0FE260163F8E64F9A8132652
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x54FAB915E4CD47C7F08F92EB5E51BB6F
until seventy-and-seven times."
0x15F414ED7734A5154E23A7D721C11F3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0xCC574758848F2C37420E26ACDF011BE3
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0xC1A1FBDE25200B32B4DCC74BB187C407
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xA67A7BC7EC4E20C43FDFD27C1B6C9AAE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xD25D136B5E65A655585B152E63CFFEBA
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x14C40AD762DE18E375195EC0C706A370

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x31E652CD32D7C21A21AA01058845298E
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0x4589FD1A667320E11F80D8DDF9CC5D71
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x933DD30815029C769196730F93B4F6A0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xB23E6A67C1AE91D99C270D45470F878A
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x3C423EA988B94546C4C0EFDF163A052B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0xA5294A881404FD28A76848F5ECFA445B
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x4CBA06B3381B25883E1FBCA673ADF1C3
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0x1B77AFF5E1EAB96A567A7330CDB4C1F3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x32785A3BB65FB9BFE6736F08F2A555DF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x629FE1B48796131B565C37FE6FB7E7C0
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x963BD634CB43A3781185C0783AD526E2
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x032DCE8BBE5AB6E02AE1BDB5CE67CA8B
spoke at last.
0x8EAB5885D6E64685CD050075D7A9EACC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0x0B00644E8E8127AF25CB590CC79ACF49
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0xAD08A930E31274DE94CA3909BF589145
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0xAD44F4841544EDF59CE23E1274C84A26
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x6E198E6BCD3EB9C3842E27D82DA73F93
sake."
0xC5096339811A6CB71BA5BE6E59865726

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x35087BB154D094A603DE65CA5DEABAE6
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0xB7E6192E199658F4ACDD8BA597467EBC
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x2B70B4D84F5D2015014AFF4193E64B40
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x66F278492C68EB1399E389F5C83D2520
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0xA4427A32F217BD69CDA8FC8F264B687E
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x3BFA26400F6E2442DDBA3DAB2748B9CE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0xE6D1C756B1B54892013444D98EBD25AC
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0xA22A6A4A3EC37B344FCB4FE23D357A6A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0xCEE1CEFFEC352429CD772C7DA63FC869
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x50256BBF370E3237E8F48A1C109126B9
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x83114E60D86E47541557B71CF037F926
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x0FD6B2B4A4980821F0ACA292123280B7
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x32A59F37C3F2DCB0DF584B57D1C13AD6
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x8C78E2B7FA2E8BA6CF2F8C007D09B184

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xC1F0F92B0EE3BE63265F4E866ECFBB69
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x15BE5DF0E1117345BDD671C9BB3822FA
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x6EE651D4EA5F27FC4A987AC1775292AE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x70B498093E2115DC70CFD5E092456050
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x4FF8A61F9FD20718D1FFB6AA3BEB9598
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x3C9D7D9A1FDC2338D5AC97DD8FC08C3D
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x7FA4C3EECDEF1C0F715EFC8FE63B5AD5
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xEDCDEDA30A38AFFF22C79DD54FFC33AF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0x0A872843F7980BDA0CE220CC9855C9EA
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.

Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x0919D824004FFE753E9651371BB19B1E

0x929618F7422E130441DBCBD8D17E7F67

"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x63F4A426CF1D82686841A822440A1059
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x97558C7F305C6029291FA7C523064318
some means that doubt is removed."

"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0xA85DBB3ECE0025E6D28D65F413E4E650
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x69259C5486BB328C4968CD44B2C26BBB
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.

Rochester?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x288B288E38E16401CB6D552204E32579
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x58081549EF1FF969BD05C4FA73860A57
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xAF0BFC63C0E9DBF927509969714C2E02
was soon out of sight.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0x7915249702BF78F88CD1763E7C926290
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0xC7760FE732804D68DBBF6D262ECE5BDC
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x1382722FCC2C10A4009DB1022E3C1B69

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x53D08BE5CDD0D76BB0A47E8285F3EB7B
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x7F725A3B5BE591BF1E87ECD432BEA7B3
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x76C0EC5BB3537E4958A4AFACB982446B
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x9C7D6CD34D127BE64CB7EBB23E92C9B2
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x333FFC73C998CF392708E86850BCFD37

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0xEF12454F9ED5D37F6EE0D3395540ACC0
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0xF40C8982A98A9F0D4E69A39FD3B0D4B6
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0x1BBF449264A0A8880BDF3319AAD96990
Jane?"
0x19BE90966A776C1BABD54B6DFBE36326

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x2C30CC2E7193383C65709E6252DDCEB2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0xF39D7F7895A777DDE64C91981291683A
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0x27281775AC216A627BD5E4805657CBFC
both concluded he wished you to marry him."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0x51ED92CED18EE17E7739C13EE696A809
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x80C4B5FD1C32F38F790DAED3EAEB349E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0xAF559183A3A8D40CCDF6756DAADA3ECD
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x06A43C466F765C2A8D8DE73DF4F1694D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x394C0C008A8AB2293A591D82D7253016

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."
0x0A9E7F985838B52151533BFF08916725

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x5A7EE5BF7FD6AC9B298E0ED4E7BE5A0C
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x74B91A6F3C197FE8AE38002BE0C35E01

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x9093FD1569EC3B5FB06FE4D021D79D65

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0xD2732D996750B97ADE88EC6C6D64B47F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x0816E0F5D4293A01EA2F1151492EEC61
as his sister."
0x199F7170346EB9E58F2B1DBB99A8D638

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x678C1FC20EE9C411FFD1A7BCDDCFEA83
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x1FAACF38C06A63EC2E7162451B37A559
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0x7D8AB918F8ABA192806A6ED5DB04600F
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xE34DF824A1F83B195939023681AF14A9
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x490D26D93BB041300C2F549B22EF574D
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x705D8DA105B55ED8D8BC0F9503840453
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x4DEAFE107C531718A79FF78EA69E610A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Not as a husband."
0xC39A5E401CC3FD58F97F00A49AE58D88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x2B36DEC4AAE13D2F95C6796C7B79497A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x9FC2CF6524A8E33C1C248499BC241D7B
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x110D0B5B9910F252D2A700CD8B93B86A
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x98FD260F54FC54359443E70CF8BEFC93

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x9B9E9D60CC4C4EBEA6E86CD3C5BC7343
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x6F48940A6E88D72623ACD5A455F3E3E9
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x50B569239652D253D077B1AD59DCE037
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0xBB519201485B5771F3511D1AA07065E6
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0xD8645A14E7C30434E0C1E0FA9021E927

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0x299D465836695C3028104A81EF4FED80

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0xE6A4813FF664034592979CFFF7A02143
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x27CDACADFCFCDFB78B379E44B032B6E0
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x463BB7B3A90334CE89400F237DC58E44
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0xC1B3879BC050FC84090BED95DA5BC8B1
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x62F1A86F79E647CB0F234AEC56732AA6
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x23340C0C62F8E19D585799A69ED210C5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xC997314FA457E09E9C3931086205D8D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x560EE7E8995A75E85AAE5AF5402B0874
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0xD9AE33D7969E3BA24A53B93F885F733F
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x15FD9C5FAADF892EDC6B28B12EE61C8B
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x20A7EA87E32B0326D49AA0A69D3BDE6A
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x6E586D96AFABA8165384A0196E17B69B
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x600B57EECC682BFC901DCD02F92A9105
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xA630A00C5DB6F333A11C45613BDD73E1
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0xEC27DE9FBD2C1FF339306CAA55CC5020

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0xB634C9EAECDBC473D485DC27C8807859

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x3EB524FFD63D9E683463D1C702BD0952
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xE988117081877C06E2BCE91357CCCD27
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x7E3A41829BF6C1741E69D98BC9DD23DD
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xA0439BD572A71F819D53DC27F489465C
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x495F8D503B16B5B014360BB36AE12D79

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x38870CEF5D467F26DF4B1923A2AA086E
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x603483A23542A8315A37368049EBF273
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x77663AA1DFEE3F8002DADD0A7CE7556F
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0xB0EB8F155C63AEE52CE8189F8AA12669
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0xC99DE878F8EC3E7242A808F959356C26
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xAE57EE4FA49D5CBA8A680134877FC23A
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x4A16604B35397D7A2827CF525EF243FB
had forgiven me once more.
0xC8401EF41BA0EFE9DBF379F313071856

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0xE1A9244868C6572084FA3304A8F46F8D
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0xCE132FC66C017D27EDED988B6563907F
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x5D7DE761FB9F5676F192F14B74CDBE79
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x39EFC8D6529CD98A916A2C355A5652B9
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x703FE78A3473E97CD48A36D42FA8AE67
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0xA17A8DE586244A865DC4D02BB1432A50
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0xEF237E44DD50B1D088475712BD3AE171
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x1BEDBB38AC0EC19A4BFF45388248815A
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x67A60339E3C6B72467FCBB811D39DD31
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xE3F9990516CCF2F1EFCD278B8B5800FC
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x5C768CF27982F15C9DAAFBE6EF711033
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x02ECC49AD62F24A6F7C65A6A7CF83080
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x83DC93560B0A41B68B8A97CF99DA6726
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x27D3523EAC1AC382FFD89564731B7798

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x93BF9786AF4BE9ADC07C3A1351AEFF43
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xCC07684D466DB9AED6D0C0CA25C0CAFD
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0xA93706D7224D3F504C22D57D3F9F0D4E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x08CF1342EABDBD2339D1890B2108A789
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x63232299D9E91B462A868BDE16A2AC9B
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0xD36474026329874FC98E463C548FE9AF
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x540C8CDFE59AA47458BEAE0A9DB9EAA1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xC56C8C1AE7A8ADDAC5F4380B605C015F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xC5AB91EA263C5A79B1BDB71D9A48C46E
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0xBACAC6C3803FBF5BA4EC61585328EB41
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x8987DFE684026BBA7CC4272CBB5C8E06
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0x5C8721725906A04C9C29776F612EE275
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x3644893DB49B6559F9E823320D438E15
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x2743BBF5163212DE50A1063101993928
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xE9F7A53FB2CE2181A2D1DB680604E985

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0xEA0BF3EB761E6733356E8A7033034574
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x5844E28F7486C6A6793A54A933D0AA7F
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0xD6036DB76497575639B17B31A842C6C0
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for

those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x3B5B9AD856114DDDC2A9857641AF137D
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x994B6EDAB2A29EE1D4EB2223AEF0A55E
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0xAADEDC9D84DC0C131C672E1EDA159998
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xFDCB6C2C700D3F03028C961E3B2AC329
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x20C735878A74D16DBC24C1EA4C36838B
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0xCA508A2F775129A9E4F7AB93E59A8DBB
could not but feel it too.
0x0D662BD40A3899EC24E3845114433C34

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x84D3494CB7449C739E671E404B98D67F
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0xD8F5526C68CF1076C21094F2200C154F
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x35FED5CCCEC36F20BD114C19FFF98C2C
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xD9DBAC22E4E26031C92588D3FB9742FB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0xAAF16618DF9CD50E5F5524736E4871F2
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0xA8925E801C202BD4103E01DB9061DADF
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0xA075A592B924C8DCE26304E6CE1A38F8
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0xF43A4AF5144FF1E2D53DE21B1E28C072
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x6F8B48D9149AADC58FC63F3EB60680DD
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x680CC991F12EF929BD4BBC8D30422A4F
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x5D87A3D17B4F926183CAB37B177F9A51
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x64A2B2F78089A1C1988779505B0304A6
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x44CEF444A885AFE512E5F6BF78B17548
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xE3FFA8FA61033648657007D723E6C815
from you!"
0xFFF097338C95B9CA605464F1DF24B15C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xAB03201ECF9A0395CF4AA028D6197052
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x99B1F8E7C8282A438AB86944CAD4875E
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x399736D02A18E2D54D8C1A8A5419D58F
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0xE51821103DE83FF31EC7C195D0DEF0BA
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x1604F42A8A6294B5434D0FF785DCCB32
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x156A5945FCA9298D92E00E27A3B6426B
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0x5AFFA67D087014AEE3316C57C2C80FC7
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0xDB18E90D4FB417A8CFC9B6665AB7B589
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0xC7D936D1EBD534BEB3A57639EB5DB1FE
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x71B255FE40EF009391D22F5BBF41CB90
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0x1E2577AD539723B5C9B3100CEE48E90B
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x04CA9140F30DAE17A606D65304F15FC1
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0x8B07A640B52B83F4CF0650DDBA7239FD
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x64170C3842A60CFB43A5F786FD28BA7E
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x8FC854512A46A00EEB209579A1B2252A
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x3E79C44C53CEAB7BA4842F904ADCF1C8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xC19DFE1577F72B73C08DA226C9621620
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0xD253540728E076B4DCF31979458431E2
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x97FA89EA0518DCFD425E87BB5A37D5BE
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x715BADD716F37A3EB68AA816ED0525C6
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x206A0D377952CB87CBF605F9B2DE6F14
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xE9FD051D8C88BB5C75FE5780EDD642CC
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0xED5BBE8E8FBAF1B1963EA8C16A3FEE87
dim room was full of visions.
0xF8CEF17D67BD9F6BC7500DD388826B19

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x674A4FFF6294F547C33F83C88AF2171F
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x49732BADA8D53A2F23904A9B0DBBEA24
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0xE96CBD6C185BC4EFA7815F1A065E786B
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x51886CFB6B73F6D4B58E68EF14E5CBDF
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0xDB93BED57662BF1B5364BEA975CF1C26
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0x81CF33983B54B4ABFC21A16E5596542F
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xA0A1B3DE1C11AFD8A3AB3106D951BCA0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xF4082D9322758262FCFF60AB6511B797
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0xB4B8CC7B99D5C1D4AA4FF291C174F452
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xD5E6B3091C81EE49DC6F69A593DB0621

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x3AB328816463CCF329A825B55A85F577
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x5A3B43CA9E1845EA17F524B1D8CFC67A
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x72454547E4EB222B3DCF2583B3E44DEC
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0xCFFE359DF5AF299B635784B5A6B4C0E8
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0xE33418F9940EDD4C76A85E3BDBB2C134
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x03DE4D26B42A49026EEC5FFB2C6BE942
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x9104D34F66D83A4284DAA41E31934BD4
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x07B82F88D77EBEA5C13F65600BB414EA
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x519114010F5A2A171007D47A6D97BA88
shall judge.
0x4FB3B7AF74A0053D6E95308043BA68CD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x53C9F89942C717F6B5BF87F0FE7B0EB3
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0xC1D9A6F33BBE354C7C5C73F398BA478C
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xEFD51D17B227931593AEBE0AB668970F
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x632AEA4EE621CDBD4A6B287C03061CF0
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x51DF997B67A0DB03AEFA3353A01C76DB
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x8DAF32EFE5A3D1C4D89F05FB1D1691B5
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0xEFBD578613AB2D29742937FB4F8B06E1
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x2A64CEED8C6C10DA70AF9610FBFFB1A9
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x2E9B96904181688DDD243D3EDE4623E2
bones.
0x1E83694A3688A6969747D1B0DFBC1444

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x6751DE8903FAD33C3F17C9B89677123C
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0xBA13797E8F537DCF0B882923EB8FEE38

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0xA0C9B6DAFA911FDE274CC8948D07759E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x2350B464D2200CA3FB260323AD4AD02E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x0AB774A4F4C513D8D38BA30AA6C0792B
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x825FF1690ABFF3EF1E9304D6370D8637
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x8827F781CFD4399A342796AF5E928CA3
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0x9C8E29B583BB256907849DCAE17769B9
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x14FEB244CE5978DFDDBD6BC46106A82E
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x24B4DD13A23F727BC26B1B014FB53B3B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x96F5060A439BA3CBD661B683E910101A
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x19E865576774EEB46F456CA90C66F764
garden: it was void.
0xF6905F6003A1986EE4314E5791B96FBC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x6B7F2718CA65FFB5F36E8E5667E2C221

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x8720A0C9407BA848882B81C486AC1358
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xD6CDDAFFE09EF501174B1DE67AA9A4B9
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x04D5DD1563757ADDB1779D4A987503F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x74A7722C0A73FCD40978F1D778C66387
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0x5DA193F0795454431C1A2FF606161B24
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x15DA0D5D4E9A1ABF16117D19D83E96D6
best."
0xB21DF224689FEF48C3865BAA62255E88

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x7C54E77CBAD1E0C33ED56EB07EFBA020
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x1C62CE3D5A6281ECD4C162C83E186CD4
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x5AB774E31484A9A055800E6006165AB9
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x7EFDD955189F7A9AF1A2257AD380B161
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x1CD432016320A6C9C9F355182767A52D
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xC08F209F93781F9B8410D09A4C9E615B
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x3BBC69279B3A1BFB771E56F079134A44
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0xB01CD7EDE9E3CED0517E7CF01C2FD756
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x9F4F4B3C7A3623D7646AECC53AC13358
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xA5178D6BBEBE2C103034FCCB2E2DCFD0
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0xA64173B9F7959DFBD53F7088CF669054
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x8A185D60B88DB55111B51509320373E3
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x3987E52F01D2F76B30068221F22933C1
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x470B950BB3D020BF114D2E3B9D0172FE
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x27849BCC05FDE234932A2C33CF99C527

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x84B2A6DE2BFCC16FA5AAD598630ECB3A
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0x6BDFCAA2B811F493BC1C4DC298D3D6D4
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0xDA0943862FB90AA28621795061B44A14
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x2FCC1136ACE2349B5D530F4F253D5DB3
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0xD010C6DA991F9D17C0C75C31E50200AE
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x5532B0B3AC994B278CBEFB9D4E424F35

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x0672A628DA8EBEA6D496493731141492
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0xA7473B89AA0A1950F167B47D6A919B22
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xE54C9D66D306A13CC2B295802826127F
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0xEC616CD88C4166EBB14539385C4ED404
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xB8B42CD2BAA1A87ADF933BF51F7D8555

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0x53B215E0D6F03CDF6F660421A5E7A909
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0xE5885366B64BF008C6FD14877D531A5F
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x3A00F0991ECB1D484C420671D4F34080
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x6919B6115C28F795AB77C0AFBFE01480
would meet the coach.
0xE2A741D0FC839A244BC3AECB66E53037

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x1348DC0C63B45D8B7EC4E558FFFF51E2
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0x621DC314C665BB36BB71055563EF6180
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x96ADDED052E3935B6258C3648E5EA470

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x76254F8431C1DCEB0095AB128CFFD241
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x8D52EABC2EF1989F3FD7940D12A5CF0E
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0xC27C9CA887E4FE44F031606AD8F480B6
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x2389F1876B7D87A9E38882DF8B8F0218
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0xC14757BACA64A27451FD911A839C4FB8
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0xF4AED21E2813AB40C3FAD48D0BD1A6BF
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0xE2DFD7028E1E53C6B2E882833ACC4D70
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0xB83095D5E4D0F1AA3E3A26E78F4766DF
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xAF9C96646471D97CFA494A28939E770E
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x8F4257DD7BA5D94A46A981C75DE60A6B
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0xCF490194DB794AE3980852976C9A3F7A
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x6CC843271AFFCB61A6E17F4A820EDEAB
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x56C530354B11D3BEC2BB0F8823C261B2
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0xE2B450EE5766F7842ACFBC037A412BEA
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x5267D885C3ED2E5DBE1E8FDD1F4F4CAD
body.
0x22298E5FA7917E11AC63AE91C0D36084

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0xF9843504D4A94C21BF02F6AC2F620EE3
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0xC917A895E90C96C422E63F31B2820E8E
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0xFA4D6782A82C56CB5E8B0A3709C81731

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0xA96A6EBC0DC99018AB539DA3786B1D53
and should be absent at least four days.
0x42774BCD3981C0F9777CBB3F641E5813

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x2D2FB047920AD518F7D0E70BE7D931C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0xE69A8F6A32C4B8DF3795E2F07362613E
time been uneasy."
0x4FD05FE34F28A2EEC2E3813B82FACA59

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0x2781F92985B44D5E1D47360696CAC2F9
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x7C18883AA60C52E9E38C59F30831EBE0
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x6C291F27F17BD55E566010967FC6D237
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0x30E835EF64CDE8E8D3E9C11167520F18
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xE8674B99546B0101C41A82E1B3A2FBE7
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0xD77E748C3972D4CC1E6343841D731FE7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x298D2882684B32AEC6AFEC535F614A9F
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x682C219C9C27365DB81932F3F8C964D0
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0xADF913BF358649FC2E435F74086C78D2
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0xB77EBFECE2C61185F2F2456B04287ECE
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x02BD034498ECA458614B4CA8C7B5517F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x06BE3BDAB926E04F293F1BD75DE8AE72
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x7EDA90E81F5865527281D34DF081DA36
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x13A40D3FFA26C7D2BD7C19752A3298B4
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x06AA4C247017CE0C60373FACFC9B5144
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xF72343076844D7B1C8D189EEDFF2A2DD
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x5C1FF737914EE6BBB94B7E5918EB650E
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x1A9AB55B939D41111119112E4368F6CE
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0xF8D2B86388E7176699CF2FD0332D4505
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x32A555A3F212F83890ED3D7CA047C6F1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xCAA80DDDAA961D308A674F9A25069EC4
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x482CC75D8FB26E4465D77D198DD718AE
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x08736DD0137EE6DEA01FC21A976DF1BB
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x95F1F5A44E2A172C9AF6925EA1EA4556
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0x8866163F3FF90D685792503CDC519492
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0xC597976B41FBCC121D25A72916E82DA5
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x7704D8E6432FAF14367C59CACFF2DBA7
we were near my bourne.
0x7335F7F46E37C5D26452CE67F7B8FA96

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xCE26BE68A8030D84404BE5C3A4773F18

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x7CD88E98B6466430DDAC3F46ECB724B3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x3EAD1430789214CCE445FACF30CFC086
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x3BAFB3AE73C6AE3D3B8D109D4AF9479E
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x923ED02CB4E074B1CF4C00FAC3ABC14E
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0xE7F6051DFFCAB58A90BC5D5F79F0A3A6
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x540C587FF18AEDD150EFFE4D79563922
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0xD91E0E1AAE8916933216AAFA3F404414

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0xF32075278931620513B1C48C40BF7181
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x0AE45303433E4DBF59F9253FA0E4B908
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x93E234F9D09355959F4EB87AA4F2760C
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0xF4F9DD3D51F23DA47FAF828717B2F3BE
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0xA41002F7AF5802B33942C760F2F50376
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0x35A583C7E8474A0729ED61F6AAC3351B
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x39BFD806EF305B070189A3B0F6E28A49
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x4E30F293C93926873A7D72B3A093D78E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x850C79B350BA38A1EA980ED425A8B15E
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0x79EE850D2EE579B6A5CCA80EBE52FD55
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0xAF245CD64B2DAEB0AD196BB9739A6582
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xEFC53C961ABA5D284562D16A8AC48C81
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x955AA3BBF545BE650CC48D7561CBF932
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0x030975A100DA3EDE04DE7531CA5EA8C3
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x8C8EDC874748E10BC9495D01A7B91BBB
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x3C7771AC062AF9501835C64C3A580876
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x22A766E9811CDB8B180531F50DFAD835
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x7E79A0449FC1C36D1085A509BE757ED5
them!
0x96EB372EE28D16DCA0C38D71C8F26CCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x6889334D6CE6A78C1F6FC846B2F988AD
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0x3003952EAAA8B85072FBF77C8F480FFB
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x7D1A1352004041B6573E3E06615ADBDB
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x7B6340A01CA2F6AB33667F7E99358DBE
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0x4299B4757DCF243CC05949F02E07FAC5
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0xBB1459F5AAC3584DAFCCE2DD0E7E54F0
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x71A49EDD51B93A047745D9BBBA1D893C
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x0FD563A840431268343A5AA2B31FF963
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x4C7029BFFA572E91262B4054AEEF877A
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x1D735BD405DE5270A74C3A15B8C98BA8
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x5D05C9443DA34A9BA0E811236698975E
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x126B99C9706CA41B308C6A3974B9DDA7
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0x48B056B2EFE7864A9CBEB2378FC49D51
tideless sea of the south."
0xF7596B6F3DB3926D0A7A53A37CE260C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x851B9D666E9621CE7521BBEF17CBF35B
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x5796F0E1BB573ACD92C6D4F46999A626
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0xD8ED1F0097F94BF1A7898AE6E1CDC52E
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x9D778D1C3B3845EC060C41533EA33ECC
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x2CB3170F4F9DE9F9D0DC97F16B2E6CB4
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x09AAA8F793A5B9AFAD850E9AB973052F
station were at my command.
0x1EC74C41E096EFC5C4876F0A6C3A76E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xEB495E157C701DE0D81EAEE3C89EC9F1
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0xA18BBF81FA0CE0A01C9AFE5A95079064
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x221D1027ADA6AB05984CBEE4C4717EAE
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x3B82EDD147081D0061EDF8B06EBACE70
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0xE8F82A5A5F8651E3F2ECBA7CEB4DA06E
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0xA5BF0B3C4E65F58F43B7A500EAD56BEA
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x4C22DDB40A26BE82096FC0DC1B807AB0
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x10E798989929982AF8C910D3763A9222

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x178968FC3D7820DA2A37FBCF032FD923

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x7C9ADB398A3A76802FB8B49A9C02F867
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xCB9D7B8C30C5FAEDB2F15B779AAA8941
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x34B1978BA5DF96E5F0D272099BE40F19
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xC50E30FFA324301C897DA89B42B5FFAC
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xA8A9E3406D2D8815E9C45D8B2F41C0EE
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0xCE1BF0FCC9B19B25DC0F23D3A8FF0B8E
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0xE244CAB1D7A3B1C05D2755C81FF38B24
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x00D779EC784EC1919CBB42AD7A58190B
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0xB02702D4B281F42541C28681173CDC28
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xF47AC9C95DED236D9F79D870B4B69F29
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0xB6E2C33B62005B155B4300D9F7735A18
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x1CC0306857186C057F421E6FF054E2EB
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x0C85AF351E011F892D383037A19AD9A4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xB27EA5651E8F46FAA9A099F6DE6972CA
ruin.
0x4EA313CE63C912730BE2FEC8B13F747A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0xF849FFD2EC2BD05321ABCC69966706E0
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0xF2A0B7352023DF5242242625DAC297F3
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x08144335614C3AC88F37F05375FCE2AE
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0xD56372DEEEE112EE41B0C48BCBC9EB00
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x3B6F5D1068184E6E4DC40CD5C6344851
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x802147655C4A67CF88C78F891735EFD6
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x64F9D9FFEA60052BFA20752E3FB9F93F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x41C0DE50D0ADFD312E137B57D92EA7CC
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0xAAFF5AE72BEAD2B914D3DC1D5085829A
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xFC31909FFF48FF64C725BDA2D8C21E33
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x57B630EDBCA5CCFE126036FC4AC03C9F
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xE71CCA82F35B45C674C20244D2A01F3B
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x6D39E52CE520707411B54AD2D52CC64A
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x5F512026EFBF3CA42B0A03694CA75B49
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0xD73BD2992DFE4DBBF0261CF42AC8CA2E
token.
0xFADF6781C69D5673C1547AA7A64D5E25

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x7BBF0DFC3120BB56A9C29B7EAAEE6942
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0xA6C412919086FD699EABA1243FB1C103
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x42D3B9904C349C2A0DEEFF2C12B089CB
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x22629197BF2976FD5EC6559A8E5F759B
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x7D4E740BA6BA79B8455DC99FDD54BE09
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x1A8AF74F4E0661BEF1FA173C92BE9782
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x5C5D9A6858D457F936D7CDAADEC5C97B
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x97D6AE6F63E1996B9486D9D878DBCD23
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x89A476C39F82D3024655E46072B39E83
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x0E97B1EE6108ED0BDF3370943DE7C357

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x055E40FF3F84AD0F67523C479ADEDFC5
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x1E43554A25B4847D2CEA79D676DAB765
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xB4FCD7A77839BAAEF108A91ED6BB964A
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely

knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0xCA79FB0D3FE1F9F8BE44607D815698DA
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0xD0088666AD8FD66EE9FB66A30FD279F0
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

trying to evade.
0x617899B39123DB49B3CB04E570A6F8EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0x6BC33CE8BE029BDB3C6E10499CBFE8D9
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0xD41C9D19E8BA3546F8773560AD82F161
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x661A37F19A4A6047DD1383DD46A1CC12
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0xEC3E6E40B89076FA313B9EE048D277F9
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x289B97B93B34C12C92152F7E6517844C
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xB46E4ED2A7B53D709C9F2B2FF1A532D3
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x304CC71BB99191D7B855EDF1AE47BED7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x091E8138E2B9E4E73346CCAF41A65A8A
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0xDE7FE6FDB11A1B543731CDACF791C06C
direct question as to where he really was.

"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a

stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x51CB597971E7C70E136FAD38C6D60E89
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x040BEFCD3CF91017BAF49A9B3CDD5A38
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xDE19E96AE102996280C5851456E5ECDD
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xEAFF65DEBA0CD7C391D4C5AF2EEB2031
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xFE51AB96DB1A5EF95F743D3F6E5E4641
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x0BE5C57DE41CC24CC3DBCB3199CA8775
witnessed it myself."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0xC5C488BC8BB103AE320EA4D673F2617A
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x270B85BA1A474B72D68C0531FF4D22A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x6EA6F392FFD222B074A2A1C4F7B86456
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x44374C62C11E834D04B7CE4719C3917F
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0xFFF86161D89F3E74108DA990E992AFA4
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x4792AD4274A5B5B06CED98076159D2DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x098772D6D64F6332EEB368B75536794C
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0xDB84FB2F395413B0883BBE6E50C41F29
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0xF5813E9CB9B932D93CB19958F88FC050
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x4F23448974639D00502511AA6E80900A
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xD1E3AB4887735BF9CCE33C7728E00488
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xDBDFCCFB3FE5A00C3DCE7C05F72A6D5C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0xF10EDCB9C883BAAE0FBECF8B52FA92F6
main fact.
0x45F693A58C76B01C1521A115098F108A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And this lady?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0x406B0D828A3A859CC445B79D94709F32
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xA1E85FA89FC5AFC77FCB04CC07B1B569
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x805E4EE91A0FD2EDF18A2C0A72111470

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x1D28D354C137F5D89B733719EEC60C3C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x2FE5CB11756C3C3DE51E7B067AC9B0AE
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x9D5474688CAE68A4452326E35512D960
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x9C90E953B5C1BDF4D4A6328DC8783A3B
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xC4C4523701EB0629E7C7B44961CA5567
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x8E108748FC907A1BDB88FD31E121BBB2
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x5660BCB0775C46E92073668A51028408
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x92A24978AE92E38A4DD8974886A5CEC1
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x5E64FE33EFAA3B619EF02A488CFF8D36
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0x1E1A370625BA60A0C51F2D4CB9FCB152
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xE016823ACA7E0BD2B1053ADDDA2994C4
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x66C5406BA815339BF709B730756A345B
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0xA42A8135EBADE97ACA816261993B8585
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x94ECB2D1C522E2572BF2A9E5FF4AA3DB
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0x93F36A4B1AF1EFC70ECE70D5AB35DA3C
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x8C1EBF1A31501309F88F26BBA6F94DA2
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0xEFE11E413DD70B93AF9BB32314E1899A
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x8C3709E91116667507273ECCA3F4DEA2
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x35C2A38A8D7630B5EE12AD8805BBC58D
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x81E697DFF9FB54A8AD90C1C0E9A12332
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0xA4A6265BDE81B367ACA16C86D041AABA
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x9DA41AFE98CFFA3C1624D13E46B72205
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0x56DED5605778F1AFA0B35DE5CB45F19F
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0x59FB6E893E9C7C539FC1CE9CD835B7FD
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x976FE09E812FDF2727E2207518DA4B82
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xEE564C7DA81BF54F0903095A3B7BD12A
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0xBA2140E1B9CCE5CFC85A21CB6E209634
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x85BE37A60635FE60059EB00BC3300896
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x29D23412CBD62BEE66D327BDC3C67221
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0xA0E0772E69F0C93229E9749E55497F44
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x8481B52BC6AFABE99D240E7642B66C09
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x13E57F1546C2DE36F57D1A2B82A54179
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x5D1F6151A3CE8335D10BC4DDEDC7CFD2
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0xEBFE157812BF8D6149CD24FB592CCECE
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x3193ED4EE491D423C6DDDA6D5C402A6D
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x3CAD5A96288AB58B10560442917EA6C4
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0x9138CBA8F5C1A90F6506AA80753F12AC
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x0C07805E885DA150F347353C522EC191
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0x25613835431997196D5F468635414931
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x308F267996BAC17EACD0A6D8AB9305E8
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x80FA2BFDC0319E302AC92F22985E0A9B
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x4D1714332DB575338C762FB7A83137AD
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x404DD6539E4C8FBBA8028E2270F0348C
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x537DFA6B8A621FD4508EE6BE38FCCC9B
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x7E9AD475BF01A4FF6E8F72324CB4482B
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0x0AD8BEDB75D84CEFF54FA03FB06096A0

"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0xCF93FCACAC9A9FD5A20D1A60FB28B0D7
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0xFC6CCCDE44FCA86DA4AB7B4593253CD6
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xAB12B0546FAB4151C6BFE835DD8CBC14
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0xEBCE941B7994BE676BFB87F0C481F18A
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x370818D9407B03612CCB0BD4DBA1A7E6
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xE127FE21E3B7084BCCB9715C56B78B6C
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x90C4A684088727DB78ADDCC2E95441C9
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x19235D0CCF0F45F7703F14D92A43C1D3
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x592DACEBB71E0FD14D18BA5942AF7AF2
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0xA396618A59F32FD9752D4D9C76DA99D5
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the

What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.

"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.

Edward."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x2CB368F8E7B7E073A28257E6552B694C
ask what had caused this calamity.
0xAF853336AF22FFB6BFA112EE36BF5C22

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0xB5F9891002813306EBCC5EC0CEC0DA1D
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0xDEBA2D9A6F99B31966D112E30D9E6909
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x020E989D06753576581CC1DEAD2D1855
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0xB665835328122D44C290A3B0AAA42547
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x8472D39F32D84C3123DE9E12E351AD69
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0xA4AD65F77D3A393C1C076D5FCB68F117
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x309DBFD9BCCEFFCA28F9CF7AA0CF775B
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0x016C93750C5F48F697553C33F10A8444
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."

CHAPTER XXXVII
0xE99BC04DF7FF4A06592E3F587D9FC753

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0xC57E72164431E6CD3EF92514C414A21C
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xBB0DF3873C69E5367EBA66D587FECAF5
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0xAC440F050CD2353D65BC13788E99488A
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x5EFBD0E358B17F1855D895598698C326
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0xF4E9607588908B9D21F7ECAAFFE22EA2
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0xF7A431E5199EED076BB72A39C6213430
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x287010E778EF178F222F2B27CD92940D
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0xACEB2EE855E95D42D358155B1A8ED679
there in the season to shoot.
0x431E299186EBC06F1EA0DCF1F54A8794

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xFF590FA5725E5CF984520A25C28D074F
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0xCA026EDAC27B74D5D702CF8CB96DC8D7
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x3F864C38DB6FD180591AB1D777ACCEB2
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x6C88F00DA75CA282EE8905C8BEAC353F
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x934E74E6F0334A70AC76ED8F58CD6BD0
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x7D6907CDE27F3F26242E0F666B631A2F
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x391D60706D38D95170C86A913B0CCDFD
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x5DFE003518192520AFB3C722C720B192
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0xDBB5A1067285703125B2674F608F9727
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xD9E7DB84B57A085878E2AA07757A517C
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xCEADC63BA45828842EC1F48DE17DCBCA
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x158D9DD3292DE57AD6C54E5D96299C94

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0xC8666CC9CD33DB0470DEC63FC52BE517
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0xE36A8E9F41B9133FB129ECDD35E4F0CB
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0xE3DDA5BC249C9C79217555A6424E7183
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0xFBF0F2D7688A968E8EF24A0C90F92447

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x2B95DA709936110A5ED617CF211D70B5
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xDA57CE44E78297CB447627EE3A77D9A0
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0xDE447DAAF58F3EF61C77DBEF0656AC52
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0xDEBE04EEB61D88855AE94AF40F6BDB95
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x7BAA6A442C233AAB2A5D89459E09A9AE
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x71A413C44A11686BF24BAB54DDA55168
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x6455052A64E81817C478E7DE9EAC72F8
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x0BED08479F7A5A961C62D608905DB4E9
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x08D47A7861A4DF52E707FB1CD482C5DE
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x90A2C579A8DAED27F18789142284BD35
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x2F12859739DF0598EE1ABEDE423621AB
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x0E474F303478626AB18B838FA2123927

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xD1817EA8A4EC84862D29DD21C39DD8B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0xFB80CE7205C8CC9AEAF5863C401B4ECD
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xEF516C844E2A7C75976E2F2A7749032E
grange.
0x53201CB6A10A67599F4143B64A37CAAC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xC36A286C878C80E51CA9CEA9830623EB
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0xAE16E3FEB73C4B4AF1F3008005229CDF
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x80BBD4D160099FB8D7951716FDFE9EF9
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x4497502C3409EADF16DDFBEA4E9319F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xAD40D0955040516664839D76D9D586F6
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x8BACA473F0AE05990EEB9789B89D6CE9
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x0EF1905633537D2CBB9371A9C9E29B27
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0xCCE831DED1473991E55084AE98B89B92
advance.
0x7C28223B222FEA2F0E81E79695A5F7DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xFE98A4670C898FB21C2E15E2A89642F4
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x8D1ED709458F7CC0B3AFD68D1DF42FBD
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xEEB8E40FFC9D0A8BB50921CD294F0066
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x15F05E0EDAB909D8019F345089639F91
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x4D6F6FFD889B584F01D4CF2897AD007B
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0xB21094C5CFDAE3A2B396DB3A10A472E5
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x1780CEEDF5543AA0E771370723143797
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0xFB67468F52F0238C0B827B2CBCB69D40

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x98BD18EE240FDE1822E991254CB9BE63
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x7A65632CAC9EDFAD043C3CFA93E7560D
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0xE115C39024DAAB5E28C0DB6EA990D06F
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0xFB837E585584F577A273A38BE1F665F2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0x60D2058E237FF8C179006610B9F019A8
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x53B663177732C32A39D56ECF7216C518
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xB5AA9A54DE73C1D5E6CA416A236E970A
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xF6BDF88EE26ECDDC2EB3384C588C9520
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0xB2F9F9455C37D1BAD7EE14105C146663
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x1F6FC940BBCE11EC03494F4726EFA425
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x3F0E3E2C0F58DE0391CA7E27480984F6
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x68C1E7BD4CD1F35F4AFC6D60914A987E
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x8FD62BE4C500D4E051A04734D963F2BC
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xBE2A54943452E75E24A6EADC8D939E24
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0xCF3EAA29694AAA07467DE4E675101125

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0xBE3D38AE8F1DC51F7D4AC4E4C922896C
had you not better go in?"
0xE47E1031A48CAB6299D419D575EA56EE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x39B5A27D33FC7285D69B2CFE2D940C8E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0xDF4AB277A138CACBF392802B22A2D401
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0x0040AFFD68188913BC154F574C763362
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xA19E91CA9CD5916C9DA5860F2F502D30

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0xA97173424644BDE4AF1B2C0D436F9B47
"how are you?"
0x083B2BC7CEFBB85EBDA7107AB3527101

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x5BAEDDCA690BEC4C21536FC3F8C85809
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x461F086F14F0196406E557CB8E96F4A0
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x1DF9ECECE96ED79EC050D909F0B3FD8B
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x63D7C21B5375DEDCDB35DCF6D6C0E7D2
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0xF2CE59ADB0764B4ED40B6771CC8D51DA
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0xD796D887FECBF587425597290B4D270A
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x049515B6F45FEAC295E7E8A3F08938E6
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x81F71FEFABFA1EDB84CB0E87B9BCBCB7
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x0CBD9B095B8EA0E4A3271F0F798574DF
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0xAB6FF6A3392509D3DDFF49F15A15569E
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x20C1DF93E7BF55C787BC66510A038A45
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xD8C1CB5901FA20494AE599B388801D7E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xDC16F080AB3ECCF6F7E74B58AA19BC26
to him, but do not give my name."
0xB21E44F51B2DB75162131554AAB6279A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0x43D662C25EA1167B70B17F9FB832CA4C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x05F72FA7ADE41EC5DAEE1786C902C1BE
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0xC44B173A13466AD5EF3A57BAB66F0129
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x0562B2E3BCAEE984CDFD9FC17A1135F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xF1BB633604D5BA430473FD5AC04AD7E8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x9E4A2C9AAC4CD658BB5BDA96D7E737DA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xC5237C29E46D26968988BF33CEC6F572

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x000D6B3FF594C40656FC0C939467CCDF
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0x4B97D106D57E9D5F46453F7DFDF8EBDE
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x01AFE6890A5C881E1D1BAFB960C6A2A3

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x3B8DF8D1A213B14E6B1D6508C69DBC46
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0xFDF8801901D3097D7F719F1847799195
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0xDBECA9FA91D64AAB32D83BCBCAA2D350
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0xE71231E55C5A7FD079FDDB884EAFAA5F
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0xE53ACACC37E7B2395C495C0D69A376E8
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x1F8E3BB2D8A41FBA1CD66EFD617540AC
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0xA9F86B032E9ACEA85E015EE4427E8BAC
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x69005DEAB5C146DF83DA8DDF3AE6882B
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x4B8FDEECC382745FC894A2485EE4E4A5
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x2C8BBE5FAFA96C4DCF2C9362EA97911A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xE599CB1ECCDD50016E63A4974EB5DABE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0xD9771ECFF3D13C7B6D18FD400CBF0C36
still excited.
0x49E0C42F6154AB5E85A5C4A4D17692B2

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xED454CB02226CDE8F01599B46592E9B6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x896888A6E5FA3803A7B4AAFF057243A1
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0xCC184B0F11CCD41EC3BFAB4381174C09
you, Mary, is it not?"
0xD0F62B0E912DF22823B3A6A558823850

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x408A0E2C8AE72BDB1E369298C0B45C2E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0xE549B36A198B3FE35803A53F7E80077F
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x1BDC42D77C4BCD97B34412204E136823
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x4D8526BC79EC76C8CFCBDCFD987CF881
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0xEC13F43BD03AB8CEDA4AD4F5C1C43463
and aloud.
0x153CE6B1ACADCABF85F88464FCBEE9E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0xFE79269ABB95B79F26CCDACDE802D1C2
glass," I said.
0x45175D192014E64A4559D6B0C05704E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xCE08356B1B8D94CFA47D1CE4B4BEE542

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0xDFCDA38E860F2F7FD8DCA67D208C807F
evening," I answered.
0xBE3E6AD2AD71E3E27337C7BC53D0164E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0xCBBD3AECEB6629C51BBDD1FDA66E474C
seized me?"
0xE8109017E19571D9886446FB972AED85

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x48FC1A99E09E863656941AE558ED9965
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x476DC9A14663115D19F67768EA456F67

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x6763EB35B2411D6A6C60BDE6B42C6BDC
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x362BCC4DCA2E823A73B1C345AAD2FBBB
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0xA5C0194A306BA33A2921A7B73C504884

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0x2CA42D047F5FDCF6B0D324ACF89A530B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x1CEFB452F19A3D79D5EDF049C9FE2A77
must be more of her."
0xE9AAB3F03F47622301846D3A0EE823D0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xEE557D557F3588173E2B72E417DCB1E6
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0xE602853F65BE6FC61950887BA78D7704

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x4A6CE0055841A5FE353AF596DC03B5C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x31B474EC1A0A8B2D59E1E68AB94038C1
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x09DC2863FCBA48DDF864237388CE28D4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0xA557F234BBE3EC4C7CCA88810E0DA313

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xAC84C906A5FE69FDB759394D1BB311D1
come back to you."
0xE936F44C9C796CEBD7DE5000D6F70F5B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xA88BA25585353BC49411DB956FF79606

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x5B337D2A5A3EB947A227B9BCAE947134
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x83CC3F3B01A63769AE1F7CAB415C353B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x95D82BCB542E87826EB76908A90F9D8C
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x2D52EC29DACA9A66980F3145CD869727
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xA92B384F7B7BA94C7CF6223D9835900B
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x65AE685FABE73B21B47AD97B2CD23359
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x4B72B1DD5EEFB15CAAB95DC66E89A2C1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0xD741A622757D17B6D21A4147D63910E1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x6BC10D6F73670D46EF55EAD317BE0A46
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x27204DD5CFDFCFDA9478030FFCAAE88C
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0xC9362B2C2B4CBB4080D2ED0C63159F57
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xBD18B3F9BBF9CFCB53A89B947BBEFD9B
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0xA4CE9FA74166F16AAE0431DFB8820D42
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0xB9819465EBB960ADF8DBD0B94AAF46D9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x919340C8D1EEF33704F28809CA34AFCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x4DE75C748376EA363ADAFEA715576BB6
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0xCD89CD16AF321DE34DF003E46CB04E51
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x62C4504D16FAA67F5EE493DFC5589958

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x4701B9D1B9ADFEC3265B516B09F52ADE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am."
0x59E9D4CFDB59DBEA4A03017C1866FE55

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0xB29ED0E7E6C84094DCE2B8E01C6F17E1
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0x333DE48CCF8E57E156373598B68C8DBC

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0xDBA13F4A0927FB3A142F4B7420416581

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0x45A6B48E96BC4D5371211C9BECC1C1C3
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0x987DDFEC9317B2C573282A32B4845932
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x5DEB78F278DBE2D7A996ECBAAA4CAA0E
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0xE4752A4EE28C3AE67DF04B3F38D07BCE

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x8CDB1EDC5575B13770593B87A3F6D027
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0xB476FCADA2BB107F5F54EDE3124C2B8A
company of an evening."
0xFA16AD59C1947C1515917AA20EBFDECD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0x67E1A023E6651738F3138CF30816B6C8
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x5CA9C269A2D447DB4C453B4468E35049
me?"
0x614D930FC1478F440FD1FE3568C83C77

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x0639A163002DEA2AA4A60175DDD96DAA
mistress."
0xEC1F676A8E54430B76F7A25526909308

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And you will stay with me?"
0x67B2DE8FBA9460E055F8D14591E84A1A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x94636BE89D6FE0844F839EB4DFBCA9A8
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x721AA078EA5D647A0DE88D5F5F47BDC7
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xA90319CAD77D06A69619E4B180D13B19
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x2ECCE93BA8AF807F2C6F402EECC28E77
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0xA43C1C6A5C178BC23AB1A0EB849EF06B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0x480919AB2DA38CB792E61B60FD25283A
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0x7016E7A0940BE55DE243339013B4F82D
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xDC3FEB0E159D0E79A6FFFC0FF2D6716B
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x90535659473217CB805E9066B3848254
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x7BC98463BF645790626A3371BC87505C
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0x36FAD161B60C38ADC335367BEC4E880C
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x90BB4A76E2AD938B98C92FAEB3BEB38E
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0xC89637ECD7EDD4520A9382FED99E2695
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x447DDCB3C1EF03E5CFAF2E10AC02BD2B
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x36FC6358A7A22028E9539DDA031C6239
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0xC05ED94CC7FDE7F000735E0330FBA9F9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x4631790B3F7F9C5B518E8707975BDD49
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0xB4864C2A86251473BC37724ED8510247
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0xAB855298C0E16B668C35480CB726EF29
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0xC1F74F53609521064D02451BEE3AE399
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x5107C7EDBCDD906D2C2DD227018B868A
vengeance on its frame."
0x011414C54B2ABF0D19550895D16B8F65

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0x57749A87F95B2619BFE0430CE78C21ED

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x4085E2ED2C999C449F67843F9FDEB83D
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0xD8EB1E22BB82BEEDD8605C9AC9CBB349
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x0534FBF152C41A988E767787C8D23638
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0xC78E8E8121BC9013690C5CE33CB6125C
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x91978F7E5030FB7B0082A2D0CA9DC0F4
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x0AF83E39D826A6CE950302139784D1DE
Come--tell me."
0xE5FD381CF22838E2C2AB1F7DA6D5A763

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0xDFADC46B26FB604EF52FF905D7ECC06D
you think it better."
0xB1DB04FA7A2C414DDCE19132F8AF2868

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x5D0F40803B99BD9B52E59665811C3518
one day."
0x260DD2EF0760A6D813F27ADBF8765559

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I don't care about being married."
0x371E777444B0E89ED809E067E8FF49B0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xAB9BA538160A6AA43695BB94A57F0D29
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x793FB41D5F0318888CDB511AD2AF0B47

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0x5456D32E07EFAE7681AE3FB7DC8937DD
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xAC54FD5309566FAE3DBB05578B48E2B7
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0xF767D6D5E3D0A9403E14A6C153304CF4
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x98D2140C481266E916AD78FFB569FE63
conversation.
0x6762C144BA8076CD5D7431D25760718E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0x1AC8EA171C42E7BCB14FB0C902D19BE2
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x6171AD30EF1B3F4554ED3A36DF3C6053
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x72790498A3FFB56A162C960D5817A634
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xA56FB8AAEE31F6B7B0E0DC139825F0C9
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x30D463F2DF062BF3EC99D7804B0835B0
not yet noticed."
0x8756AF3639671BE2A3D0F544B18DEBEA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x45774D571807099DDC86B005002274A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of

fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x37F375F1DAA39F410B07213D8F210394
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to

your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x3BB4E505872A56BC33EEC01F606FC82A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x368C19C32906FD7D937397AA4C3AF25F
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xE0D7F121F94C6113630A38AA773F5AA5
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x01E8303E6CE297819C5872F3F6A6C853
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x8825575DB0260A9153F29E1A0C4EB0DC
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0x9DE9EC278AE106850DF5D7E93CB8789A
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x66B35F822D6FB56EF250AE496E9F793C
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0x004FD759C274B174973C91A82010013C
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x71B57A4F59DA6EBA1FB63326B47D9CF3
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xD0729A01D5DC8579752F502243275CE1
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xF7932C995990BD5687FA1FAD270AB61F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x56D3D85898034D6C0F7901CE4540CEB5
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x219C115774ACE51D107E209E53998CE6
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0xB0975B312035ADDD9B8E64B66978A00F
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x1A3A278B03497B3FA4D8909C5DDFF465
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x2804C7175CF89EF08E121DA52A60B9E6
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x4CB859A65437DFEA78FC39F991143AB1
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."

0x5DC4851F3F3E33BFB8CD51830C7B3709
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting

Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x83311DD1DD0DE818837E122445927BE7
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x84EE5EC970F2030C695FB57A646BAC95
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x6A2C0BED3972C01CF7D0131E66DEFAC4
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x48D4F4FE0F65FD47350B3556D591C989
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xB5F43DD4C0FD5F188D33DD18BCECFEF6
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0xE4A6390BEBF942DC6ACFDC902D9C4AB0
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x5894857BE5F6443CDFD6F6E11640DBFB
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0xD8286AAF5585492CD8A6242567CEF8A5
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x78F1F6A3B530A060662FA99300FDA5AC
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xD0028D9E34BEB4C1A110DE87618095E3
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0x4EE2CEA89B815C4EF5D5CF75D8FA76A1
them grow as broad and black as ever.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x50CA2E27B18EDD76D90CBAC0D3A2593B
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x5C3FAA3852C81E278734ABA51CC6D4A9
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x09CBAD07F62347F85D60D062F7CE88B6
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xCA61628E161138AB07B06FB88F0D7357
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x4B09EB9858F91FE93653FB27058F93CA
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x2854BA545FE5555D1FEC26C9FC3BED8E
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0xF49A25FF42AA9B189C9F6AA9837AECD9
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x1F29CD9348565C0F6ED83D4BD960BAD0
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x55ED8E41A24F809C4609B07B9F56CF9A
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x298D76F2EC4E9B0166C69FB9C2DF419E
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0xE8DFF619DCA7168AC4644B4A19C6A6C6
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x5F98FA1A7389D08A21033FFF66585E32
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0xF145D2566AF7FC2C606D30D3CBF4854E
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0xC578D757D4639570A45F1A196F7244E5
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x740FB7F905C7D78C72F45C66F2BED4E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x6CE07138529217A9A1843EE49C9CC299
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x04353C58D5DD72E136E1C4FA8C5C8C9B
soon."
0x5FA77D62CE4F05C37A0F527AFBDC839B

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x07B8E6C7833D5A68372B4CBFFFDD55E7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x9C12CAFEC3C695C38391B4F4AB6F72FE
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0xFD92331D69F41AE63978E18FB4F5E780
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x070C9B48BC750DC0698050D1FD0BBD3B
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x91A9305E3EBF01F8AB75EA869DB993EF
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x46A170E22E3893E71F07CF769CC61858
can feel is in her presence."
0xC3FCFA3C101CC532A8BB0EC41E0F6BBB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x96605B2BF0CED7804817C0C99A8C5B45
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x2D63687BD77E98A423A1EB88B5607B0C
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x725AB33A176F4B8440FBB03C4CC4915C
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x40A525BE4B32F133A10008F702434A75

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x84C906D3E0E39E656905371F1AA017EB
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x2C395743EDDE9E074EB1CD46824FCBA1
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x4F45270471DD34A87CF34E9627E58BE7
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0xE436EA5A975FED8E2F7E28466CA6B6EF
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x8099C5E8268FB6DF31BAC3D424B6D7D8
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0x7C43F64D9716DB56D0991C08D93DDD91
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0xA41DE7C32304CE0CB564AFDBD4968006
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x5E7FE796F1D608CF1D77B1D86C87A3FA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x90B3832915D3732DCAFE8DF1A9B511D4
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x26D03481128ECE1BBB7622C4A049D044
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x15B8FFFCFCA9E550B63C3118EABEF865
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0xF3FDE8C4AE3845B6234DA09B4BFCAF70
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x32CA1B138EE512C3DEAB5ABDDE651899
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x874A16E2020A288EDC30213115D21BD2
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x3AFA13B04C41C85DAC32AEC1026DDA13
she do?  Let me hear now."
0x5C738C8C83E5E14F0871CA1E97F08F44

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0xC96EE5DD5EA246450F719C78126B2C79
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x83742DB51A1CF7607C92429A8F17BA23
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0xF5091F0934AB565187EE821290ABABE8
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0xBCCDF1DC6DD749E2664F8933AD05230C
deeper than I wished.
0x641D8F2D3F7CA29E033837E5ACD7047D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0xCB5E684A1ED5BA6392B37939C933435E
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0xC233712159BF1903046525B81883C668
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x85F18F3653388B019CD1C5EDFEF80B28
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0xEE9B06646280AB23B1FAC810C83042B1
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0xFA862A6FB1F41215A90FD9CD6321950B
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0xCD2885CA6A66D6AA71C5AA47ECBF134A
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x8426194A78C22EA73D2B8C83379D0D47
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x5D5CD728262BB8ECD31BA926DC0DD94E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xDACBA706F1C2045142F4626553697F9A
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x10C136FE404386B0C3FE71DD60D02224
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x2861294C7CBFDF9521169507E3D78B52
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0xB49157AFC1189C20D115C6F7557BF5E1
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xF30E45A0B14D828386F9DCF7ED5913B7
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x7E7EB93E3247C4B8CDE4C6C522838EF1
up.
0xEB3F26E623DC86B2BD16CA11D60008A9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes."

"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x118C9AE5094369047E3568AACFE5425B
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x1DD5B072EF504B48D91C967C246F2A22

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x7B1A40E075596CDF380E97271607F59A
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0xC27D45E25D76F7A91D5635AB30293739
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0xF55A3918287097F3CC6FA82C35CADE82
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x43713906048843BD0E03A85530EE12E0

the next somewhat unexpected observation.

"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0x39A38562467E349D1B96E2184CBDB01A
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x6875DA00BD697F327C8E861BCFC8EF6D
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x5781B4684B12F2AF590D842D063B8372
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x285DEC4DA014C1AFFC02874E82170163
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the

sir."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0xC4572C44DCE3B73BD1619A3D7F0797FF
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0xB983FD70863B5F73F0FA66C91208E1B5
question or two."  He paused.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
0xFA25D3926FAC320272589AB30FCBEFAA
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
0x602AC81929C14B89BF697B670B968E77

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the

same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I

have given you notice to quit?"

"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x854E4E688AD1DFA94D4B5C63217440C3
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0xE30E1F9EF437228CA0DF0A96E4CA8E3B
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xB2B4BC37E33BC24426A7FFAC679EB3AF
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0x54668037DCA7D2D02C73449BFAD68270
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0xC790D70D59F0C972DA4378D71EBC002A
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0xDAC8952C6725EAD933011785DE50DA9C
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."

accord."

"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so

truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
0x123E9F30FBCDE6AC2721DC3FFC024F52
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0xFC31566984F90FB7EC848008DBBD66D1
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x73EAD5339100AD79CD320C426F719ACA
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xDE0A4A0A8BE0FF196FB7968AE5E41587
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x12FE3A006DB342D5534D6D74251F36AD
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x3F20038CF70A69BA6D387F6082B9B186
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0xDD4A867BAC4787B450DE97D82FB7CB5A
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x4CD7E03EBD51525BC0CB967212E25E55
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0x14AE90ED65936CC2D662F5C8AB78A6F6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x47CDAA0B0D4B35D4860F81BA6F953B06
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xE0C3BEF37EC12B8107982E579CB2F4A8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xEFC61880EA2ED6D1907CA6E06A2023A6
you and Rivers?"
0x5C778C72BA04E54B3060FCC9F3759FC1

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x2A67B0BE92E837EBA3E24D27E777BE5B
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x2F2F4A104B9C78B6188802134C63C703
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0xD56D624F2ABB3616A6833883E07BFEE9
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0xBB33D60D9EFB419DB9FD88871FC19125
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xC346D395C40731AF541BCC3C0B1D5BE3
of me from your presence for ever."
0x22F19347AA4208A8BF43EB4377D8C58E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x1DC6E55F049135C0CD517F66473D1D51

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0xE246A616DC492C1459BB58626E14E17D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0xC970DA722A66AA9BF7CF89FAB4FBAC66
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x863E6268F74E365FCC7ACEA6FDC14CF0
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x72F1364F38639B0E0F22C1EF871B7947
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x3826C20644866932F62E63BEA7431CC4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xD0C82734B2627567911F82D1981B5BBA
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0x5BF5409C679CA66EC223348D8F691293
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xE077C981DEEFD95EE8E2B9613F0BF93F

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0xE2F5519AC05349BC1A938DC9BFFD2D75
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0x3FF4EDAE6F03F9974EF277A942DFE3E4
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x27E3D2E4574F5EE3F8F0582842B530CB
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x1DFB4475F741FA0ABB37A7FCEB85F0B4
offers them so safe a prop."
0x02D0DB632B22786A58F94959851E7ACA

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0xEBF5906D767378DB9E1307C8CFD009E5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x6478AF0600ABB673B6BD166838F7608A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0x5FB6B4E031FC249BB27BCDB4FE87773F
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0xB934F9B73747E3868FB0D686DDD10C82
helped me.
0x2B9D8F209E6914D39234DE726E2AA3F7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

on?"

good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
0xBFF10BD927BE2D1BEACEBB0FF97010AA

to be as happy as I can be on earth."

content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
0x6AA1048AB2C606DB8447437CBAA50B6E
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
0x400E6E2E0D01FB79F64A20FD761AE3DF
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."

but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I

preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but

"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0x57FF7259488B12BF6D77B5C9F4224255
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0x467C9F62434E4510DF506DB5513382ED
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0xB63440D0236F56B4A83509C4A0E988A8
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xC881A0535A10D728E6C14D6186F8B013
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0xE2F6A491C87495BCDAE57976CABDADEE
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0x4CFA1E38EE9C85247F44B38E0188FD9B
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0x435A9BCA0020449F7569F00B2971D019
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xB31EDD955623C6A36EA83098AEE6DF3E
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x86AD07ABD5AAD87BB6A5593734A1031C
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0xE63DD125577B388BB2B5FB0CF1E0A188
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x671EBF8DD061AD31BC6F0DDB5A43F53F
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0x6D20650B09A1DA594E20985F284092E3
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x47D6C62718EE29616BE75A3EACB4BFF2
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x1ABD830D6D79CB8C138E1F258EAF80FB
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
0x6C19F15A9A5F2904CFDDDA0993BB942A

"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0x3D8B0E19FCD2129620B89A08903EC3AF
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x01AA930F7A2D33B6E469D8DE95667E1F
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xB554BC14B3E548FC90033D172F6B0020
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0x4BB9CCFC1FE394125DFC30CE5E3830F7
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0xB5CBD34F6933FDA47DFBB3CA4B5C9E4F
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0xBFC69B36BD8D3DF59297866C158F18A9
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0x67534000294C677E62FE3DAA987BD5B6
rejoining Jane.
0x56B4F7FCCCDF856CFB7BC030011BE8C7

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0x460A38D9AE4F90ACAB3A4816823373E6
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0x059E6EA1E49C7E6F566BFEC7A4709F91
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x329B83C1E71C274613DAC1941DCFA6B5
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x3C314C4524CF5AE8B992A904F5D87683
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x8A05E799CE4DE85FB406DEFF7CBFB365
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x6CF6C9338D1F34965843C7B1C7D6F8DB
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0x506BBA7330DE4556266289A244FA3E9D
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0xE3B179CE6EF251C649F1DDAD51E81544
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0xB4C130F429FF2635B0074E057ECE97F6
Jane!  Jane!'"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0x4B276D0C09E864B6A0C0FFB71DF17A8C
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."

"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0xB998546241E880DF11103693A85908B4
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my

blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0xDFF0C593EFF09625B9C1C32DADBD8EA1
that I heard what I now relate.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0x1BC4D931C6431D86438B414653EC70D0
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xF3C25F62DAF0AFF68DC3B2D73D659056
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0xC7A141327FD02F5E197D65B329CF6213
are you?'
0xADBBFF6EA624C141B3EE1B7E5214A26D

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x029F9F1D383104C1DD5FE43FD3A7C601
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0x69727EE4FAE8C6C8CBCE8481FE6ABBF7
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0x037A31706FA790F3D016398DE68BEF14
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0xAEC1547D7089878D31638AF8E0AE72F7
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x69D417F9128A9C7DE420BDEC65A4284E
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0xF7B525459FFD7CEFA79C9AB174698F29
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0xFA0BDC2D67CEED9A22103A4D41C454D4
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x2A7B50D32E35011BA62674D36685DBB3
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x7F71D68A77505EB5485EA7048AE27B7B
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0xC6E85B868EE3EFA9C17E9752181BFDF8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0x3DFFED7E8A64E30C5A9AB2B199912637
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0xC3DA486ECCBCAC538A1C3F581EE23EF5
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xF02A39C77D6F3DBC7BAAC0CF13A78195
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0xE1AA98471B0AF134A5205611CE4D8DD9
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0x6B5416A158B3F54DD46CC041C4D8D11D
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xA694789D0D8053DFADD7BEE64EAD56E8
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x5F4CBB10C70FBE2193257956FC150476
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x6F53FDF1C11B6CC3BF79F8139685EE3F
them in my heart.
0xB9540C5ADF80A4731D0F04BD848B7507

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0x29EC778B39C81649E206A13EC7845603
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xB5D9AD2BBFE669CC117A1F7542768410
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x6E620D4127F06443E9C8930CC320D0A9
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0xCBC47239D2E36C93A35B2B2C17EBC8EC
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x9A99E3660B08D2954F282B22AAF16069
God!"
0x48A8CDC2DD531800B44E3F6696173C19

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0xC41DC08C9B4FE422229C158F9D2E34C0
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x5DB7F3467430C78ED9B0F700D1BD4651
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x00E3312C4FFC79BA48A3177B2884572E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0xE0CC7DCAC6120D413BCA9877FAA4D787
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0xB976490E14BE412BFB78D77DF1C8B4DA
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x324BE38405AAAF6D11E26AF1BE3BFA7A
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x73BEC2C7E819D8452CD787C1156A6DE6
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x6CA915FD63809E9CB13033DA1CD834DE
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x133C3B22920C4E0CBC81E6E111CB7FDB

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0x5E09018CDA41A8212F0025B9638B6830
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x29C82D3EDC117F9495CF196FAD858C84
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x4B1E5DD6C0750F2F2F6A8A8D18382EF1
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0x7185F2A78748CE5332DD932F665007E6

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xC7FA987A383C74B938D4DC620813C8C8
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x9884895FE7B9D3AB93339D90E5AB8C3D
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0xA1352B80D9EB68815D7BB77EAEAA5DF7
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x3521482D547E40A27748378CFFF22545
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x095F87CEDCC9B3B57A7459C23803CC67
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x666322BAF8F7169F9A4B60FB00460817
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x6139ED6CDD1E24DEECDFDE9D28F5A7AE
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0x95828F8BA219F7904D6FE645CC90BABC
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0xE6CFB021275BE086D5ECB6957D2AFB8A
again over the roast, said only--
0xAE5854BEE924513669F3735857F4D9E0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0x1C0CAEF557D6CC83C0A7B8D83CCD8150

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x725E62AB3E46889A4F1DEB6C5A3DD83D
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x3EF427AD5B7D43124BA968F6B4992B6D
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0x3D692BBDF1730236213996792B907DCD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x5306C231916AE0F606F34C9E2C120016
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0xF62B390AD1BF2ECEFB188E5F5075F4A4
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x2F210AC2722CE100089631EA2B0A6DDF
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0xAC43224CBFAF61621A5BBBD8DDDD7BAA
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x663614E4748B300E254AD06B8C644440
politely pulled his forelock.
0x18F9A276985CEE0C1028912D7F12EC9A

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x585F8C49C4AD3D73836A779B5DE7D7E2
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0x8E20529B8D7FDA2A23FBA059D12564F5
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0xC608726248954170A6A761CE74897145
caught the words--
0x4D2C801DEDFE645A09FFFA7B986329F0

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x3BDDF61A8B07B8BF06F22DC108E01C17
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x602D6636342694B464FF9A9BD6A45E26
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x04EE089C90DFEE22856DDBA693056FAD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0x45C171F9FC1E0878332696BF57A9B43D
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x153582B82AE3C5D5AD97C9F4F7173DC0
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x89FE8DBD096836C0357CAC8A9CE6F949
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0x33EED0DF3152B9703B239BDA9983E86E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x721C113D38E57623967D0E5D9863B0C1
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0xD791B31509EFCC7BD5244FBF4D750E74
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x8FFAFBD0D6CD0EB0ED8F467DCFE94BE4
grave or mine."
0x41E1F00D66908CDE2580DC6274A80C5E

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0xDB63E4965913276274DBF8F917BC4049
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x8FF5735127E21D83C505BA9DFDAD2A1B
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xD17A424D258FD294E610148B7D376957
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0x8838C3052ACF7F6F686B7C90CBD55EA5
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x2E78F2F4A6A93F7A4928A1E4B590E456
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x1A474095A3900AFA74932B617BAF8005
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x5F2F6E46A7C6360B44E979D49A6A456C

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x22165514624FA86CDE9A9BD1B6135D66
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0xE4482694C3CF951623F014FC14E71AEA
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xB2E24D0A95F5CB0AB6C633C8A97695B1
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0xA8C9F79613B2D0E5EC9F9DAEA5150B84
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0xF238ABE34EA095C1FBC92BECE95CF55F
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x35B279E3875C7D2F84C140986BDDC4CD
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0xC7BC4C85F0FA0D9EB106A06592651C57
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x3DCEBC8406AA149B3F05AB2BEAE7203F
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x9D10C4B8CE56B097FA3E59DE6ADE5D98
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0xD74A5456397A02A2BC041B6E56EFFB6C
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x61ABE84F98DC1DFD012195F5E22AA868
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x3AC118F7E2F4B35390843A6F20AA1B00
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0x6DCCDE8267393B9399A5B1A397FDC629
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x97393F3E423DC24225CC5A2D8EEFAEED
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x8287E4A47E170EB25E0143EBDCF7BD15
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x02DF385276302D64A053E21526795CB5
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x7EFC4B80EE2D62294D2DF9BB47741F0D
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0xCB3238E3C4FD54B6735F77001310992D
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0x80976663568326592F5EF55C1D23D6BF
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x3D5584DDAE1E635B21B801D96C7E1070

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x3EF68946C1ADCC49D1D5755E6F6A9ADC
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0xBA49DF93642B55B02EC25A39BD84AC4F
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x468DFF9663B8940365D45A0CF4F972B4
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0x96CC6DEFF9359CBDF7184E0647E5C787
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0x3F56393425F0305370DEE27A19B3FAAE
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x1F3ED65DF2EBDB1748648F4B8D2F2170
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0x2543CA4FEDF3D988809205A662B7B248
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xED3B7CA0E68205C43398B13F544446B8
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0xA2354DBDD9BD7B10E058FEAFA0CC98C8
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x5CC269EEA37461D975612BB1A7A07387
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x99A4B56EF798C984178AD86C520B84B2
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x3D8BFF003CCAAAD8EA2FE62D22CCCCAF
concord is the result.
0xF22F28B4CE10F19D5453E32A286253F4

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x0EAB34A954260E2281ED135AB09A51A2
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x067837513AB9C80C6E7AE6580539150B
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x29B69F80B0257D97B04EA7C98C0982B8
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xF4876EFED711ADE5F148754CC1B51F81
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x2CDFB288C823F363736914F612691540
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0x2508C0D75D72D4FB848155F4B3EDC589
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x4882235936AE67C425227815A5C82256
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x021430B8A155255D2ACB4D3AD0E34F32
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xC2CD0EDE8036C3B5566C277E871C5EB9
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x4057A5AF14CCAF9C4F6DCFCC711B1C09
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0x2076F31A0FEAEE30294650BED18C80B1
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x09D6168EEBF79634542DE3E01E2EA40A
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x41FEF1F66C9CED31CD4B8369F8286EA7
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x6E643D840A50078C58E214B8A5488E83
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x58D9920AC7F40DB83D85AA6AA7262F20

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0xBC0133FCDA97D1D76333CF84A671225E
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xA349F5B51F1601B933F773C65EA89D90
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x40D4085044CEB2353BCF1683AC96CDC8

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0xCBD54F0FE1BB4D20D69377B037417727

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xE1EFB4D9D4FB892D59E0BFC69938C552

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xE8FC287DB934C3558B90C8D29AAE99EF

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0x54944B2AB4C32C7DFF19B65D1608585E
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x61E9F293DAB1DB11791A44B5230EC846
sure of it.
0x6575700E484FDD1DAB4606ABED74A2D5

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0xDD8A24C5F38297572EDE3FCA3BDB16DB
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x3E166F37D9BED35527B6B38AA41671A0
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x9F5EC5A2757DFDEAEC3B77131164BCAC
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x6C0CF153EEA31D9BFF22835B2D66ACF0
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xAB517D29607A55303EF42226E69DA23E
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0x47C9240145226F8C5746AF19D946FB20
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x4656F02D84E49044A3A4AE7944B0137E
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x1F5EAC8EF35F6AFDB28483A59EC96548

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x5A6C6E558E27BA1A2E0BFD191AAF689C
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x05FE92CB61B1E0DF8C25D589B987C341
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0xB2F6D4B2358033D0E31C60ABB4537A93
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x00AB3E7EBF8CB7089E71023E0FCDFEDF
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x184B7A06E15C775B8A6E48BE39F522E0
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x91779956A8C43594D4B7BD0385FEC492
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x44F0C7F044F832D807D5EC04EC5C19B9

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x16F773422164AB22EDFBA7E52C093A92
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0xA66EC5914D8E96133826C3C2008FF633
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x1B7B1D8A5E71FE818234B7E04CE50837
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x19B1856DFE15D560626F36A68171C449
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0xDC0EC2A35240919EEB13BD591AA80160
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x0D486A18131B66CE961B8F8030F2EB5E
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x036F56F26BC4B9DBAAFC9307EE0B97AC
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0xA625336B8E44BFC3FA7DBDE31B0D1A53
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0xF03B7ABA25299ECA2019274C92A6B922
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xC0A441E253C527BA9299CD1D8F7C1A1B
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x5344304EFAB9E6DB0D50842BEA8FF563
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x2DAEAE838248CD02D1B076F585DB02B3
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x10BED63EAED3E01BAAB2DBBFB3E6FE33
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xC7E0B04FABB22F2911E006B394559F98
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x469A47C76D7D46AB13D5F753B5A4A9AD

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0x9D91C7E5AAD5E169F0C3AD9FAAFB32C4
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x5F8CBF69ED8A29FA4C67BCF7EBCDC52B
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x3FD28D072993E163846A3A1B13EA5E32
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0xBF303BFD9574C3D7A00B8CA5EC192C5E
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0x5755CEA4CE791E68BD2BC9B8904D2261
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x02D1F4895BFA7FFF5D006558F1CD0B20
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0xAB1BB80856FDB6F7E09C6EBCE8B3CDE9
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x59B6A0F636EC968395872E3B8885F1C7
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0xF7711BE2B8E667F0F0F4A573041BA0BB
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x7FD69F671F7B3CA51E668E96C5989184

0x1115F1589EA049273677588E81CCA218
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0xE732EFFCEDB138ADF10D0518E0B3E2F0
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0x3C2E39298382B67BBA29BB0918406B9A
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"
