A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0xEBE693764E4803460202C7FB33E785E7
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0xBAFD5BEFDA0017EDC1464BA3B89DA98A
miscellaneous remark.
0xF27896E505B58F447FCDE13AEF59E725

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x4FFCFF4AB00A4CDE185F1DBCD009A5EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0xD5C8D7ABB7935202F82EF9F63239BA11
few pretensions.
0x4627C3A9D0DF430EC2C8CC9F821A593F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x6F7AEE890B3559304E4E406936E5F3CB
obscure aspirant.
0x4D349AD9BE05CF7B84029C3F1C6C0EE6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x00618C5DDE30BCFBB9D59C4FEDD90779
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x71CD47B98809CF2E63B407D56CD65F96
Author.
0xAB6735C0C4C5B144FF5E6F7C3660E8AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x5316DDECEA49ED681B1B02BE0E65C747
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x3BD442B70223484B6A4C7E99380C7651
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0xF50EA2BC8E102ABE0A7C12C6F4E889A3
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x6AC54257D3278B8EB6B1FCD164199B97
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x174BE3E5DC832762837EFA7C933D4382
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x69EC4A817FB21AE20AFA42F0C637330D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x8582522E55C9F4E481F5B62B517DFCEF
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0x5CF6DE51AC1BCE25D65D289AA5755EBE
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x24862B974E3D8D687B9075F38677AA61
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0xC12E3E3B8B6CD4FEB61318C47830F1F0
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x3E6E62AED70D7FB8628D15F3729103EA
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0xA53EFA6F7C4484B230835E8F19FC5213
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x98C46DAF744AABECB1D43B71C25398C6
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0xD47AA2F09EC10135B495068FBDFA2E75

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x46740C21872612E5A5C60A8C7DF17B84
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x21340CD41A29F7321EC2A3127B5C1021
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0xB5CF475C1D9574B465D31C9FA5F4E568
Thorns.
0x7290EF0F557EA528A029A4AB0C46E875

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xDFF1BB81B87C0C6276338E40E281F3E5
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0xC40EF562C63A92BE30714D1BDDD4F664
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0xA01A5C0592A8C442D2089B3F2C19B344
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0x236AC521E4C4585B2E5221A34ABBD472
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xF6ED8F10389980F795AF4F8047FBF6B7
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0x4CB8D9DF9161516F53FF5548A4314090
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x9E9C8C8091FB0348DA266CC9C03C87E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x6E06144C9A13E74CE3B5F49EDE8C7C7B
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x54F35314AFA14598011D3DAB6BBD08FF
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0x40908E62268EC68B6D448CF5FD0138DC
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x682DF48A5E1FF62EF66DF10BFFDB4C39
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x74C1C5EC5ECF813FB26338C123E85614
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x5964B4AF9B3FB30020B2CFEB452436FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x2C469A34E60B25F9592F339CDFDE1446
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0xD4C1BDEB93DBF9B8569293C393EDE036
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0x21E308C827502C4056C899630D50919D
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0xCF78D7D0D375F5654FC563C0D36B3A03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x05BDB188B38CCBE595A600AA9550EF67
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x041572375D0E0F0631D7001B8E6DC4EB
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x0B114F86FFEFBF88EE8CC0304C2B112A
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x25C39A14F3E1504D3D832D623D38153F
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x18742DD5C435FC218F4D2B6AE686AB35
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0x58FB8F92AE93F7C5D21CA5CB642F1A57
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0xEF3029ABBC1B7CEDBDA6F4DE3607B160
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x2931D7A84D4E9CD954CF6BC232604BBB
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0xF05FB776D1B31FAF48ED6A86FE2E367C
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xABD7EE3B204D4FCFDC985E24288F2B9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0xC3B82D46964E62E016561E73BA585891
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0xA05F46DFF5BFC48EE81149267A2459FB
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xD468D0BEEEE0B2B897F92FC8431BF362
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xAFD73D4FBB2A6DBC244C80307421AD2A
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x40215CCF9A4A9109D3B35A76F848810F
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0xBA544A709D2D9F7309D0925F266125FC
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0x484C78B707E2C23E68C2E65C1127447B
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x78303D686E5230B3D5EAF4BAD667255A
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x7CE1A7914696ED51612B7B21E4A015A0
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x1A7BD4BFC723AF791F64F809A705C5C3
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0x41FF1753E4EEC3707555C287BF791C35
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0xB0FDA942E458AB8011ABC5F215F6161C
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x4D57A68AAF15F997DBF64C8298B63CAB
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xF7FB3D4C8602FAE1D76CCE682A4073DB
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x78E1775E0C4E70EEB8D2268C237C8781
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x78A70C3DA3D968F579338B6C616E95FB
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0xA07D6550729FB6DEF811EC9A32D98A5A
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0xEC5654414EF6A60786653D1149BD3567
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0x98F0C946BA6126CA66B5A58CD730E245
denied where it is justly due.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

been made, and to prevent future errors.

There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x335D6039A0AE395608C097C50F6BE73F
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x3675E22D5F98C311A29198FEBDEF7344
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x6BEAB21F09D41187A7D1B51E51786147
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xE71976FC7908CAEA477266865041FE28
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0x52C75FD93531D004D96957C135BFA180
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x8E64EC2A531BEC4450700014395D634D
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xA877906C14A1BFB31AE3BA1CB5313441
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0xED407DAC23827846D6523FD902840E2B
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x8729983AFBC7E91D27C7870D6DDFBA9E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x150DC3720407F5C904063BF2787D5E21
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0x7C7AB16CB15E4BAF06F0369152345BF3
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0x65FE415496A3654CF647D36F77450DED
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x51DB37AD1C1360018AC5F3DE6D1543AB
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x3D056CC3B670F5317A912C1235A890CE
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0x9CF0283E6809A30EA475087FE4212C90
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0x26DA8C754CFB35CA36F91883A0C37724
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x33653CF56600873C726EE746A8A46C99
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x9F1250E0DFA7C6BDF1AE7DD55360568D
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x206E59B6252693E1D7F96F78F957CF57
little children."
0x563F1B0531355929E278FE634667EADB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0xA8B571CC9C81ECA988BEC35934A2874F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0xC858DBFC3A84A9FE55DC99C219451F7B
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xE50141147D47E1895454F0F430A58582
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x0859ED8AA26B90F9C18C47901F2FBE91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0xD1D3DFE7958AEC153AB10EE0C7BA53D5
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0xCCF5593319237D7ACD1B4EB6D21663EF
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x14CA5B008B1F6BD0CAB5796A5D4BF682
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x8178030140296910B43E7B77266934F8
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xE5E1BAA5AEDDF4C6089D65DE15BD211B
retirement.
0x5A7A48A8915346D9C9DD223A65A171C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x5D78582CFEBBDCE562E660EBB1D72DF6
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x69C1184D9800CC379383A6CDD537228A
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xF8D351502A6F426187585619C54E16DB
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xEF879620AE570D430F5F9078BC20277E
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0xE3D230C08FD00B95D38F5DD5F7F36EBE
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0xBEACA48E43E56B811F26A74C6CED8C81
lamentable blast.
0x4AA0E4806FC1E949C815024FA6F90443

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0xC4EA06EAD279F5376EFD94DF37667FD0
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x433BAEDFFE01AED3094F9C5F680BCCB7
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0xD9AF59623A2223ABEDE88B29EC196A82
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x88E930472F43C7BEE6F7CA6D8463B492
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0xFA15AAAAD207C6DDD891388B2965D73A
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0xA111D649FD64BA0B44E03D429E0AF3B0
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xB46B838DAC31B64DACFB1047E63BFBCC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x49DC0B2659A111000E3F45E52124BFF5
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x8D4951D6FCAC116B34AB414857CCAD9D
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xF5D5C241C31C697178962CDAAD112F1C
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0xF715565C4C951D3BE3C3FB4F1B4685DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xEFA2DF4CDBB9B06A1DE45D0D3BB53D81
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x6D6C11A805322B58ED6DD6A0472AEA19
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x8605D5BAFF7BD2D322489B11BE4B4DCF
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0xF31A33D9410C89DA9EA345F1A8CE3346
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0x950057A9D6230A59733D0EDFABFBFF5E
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0xF5600B58B2A7F7AD78E4AAC191C22EAD
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0xB6F4D7294A6D18253E2E30970454E715
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0xCD2169E2B5193539DB3E2A12323F2D4C
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x25A38A40CC53AB066F8C4F0557FB6DF1
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x328B46CDB7A151CA0F9DC339251023E4
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x409B592F20FF32868834CC892B797D6F
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0xEEC6699E78CEAD503B4DA2C081C0DBEA
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0xC5C1842FBB9B3D5BF4421E2638DAE5E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x377E155DB0071FBCFD05E0CD18D7449B
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x33FE17F97D6954067ABC4A803BD6B152
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x976C213B5BF7E2CBE366AA5CC146DA1C
hour of eventide.
0x36893D9B0AF2F97AA6B460161E6A59F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0x915172D4B10A9F4CA6E091F6CDDD8FE5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x897F7362E93281F151F571267C3088B6
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x06F1E5D01F7E31B94989FC789A36AD85

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0xDA6322271C838782BE708F0CFE88B5C6
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0xEC3DB8EE759F989299CE39413BFC1DEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x93B4621BF19269C9A669DDBB79B07CD2
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0xCC454932BFDD23B53302A72C66707425
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x3670378D0D0FDA7706427B239D520D37
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0xED265AC92A5E0EDE5E2E763843E4B5F8
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0xC37AB4352BF47E8BEDC6FC5979E64367
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x494CA2C88AF6B8DD1EA81CC412C7A94D
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xC21BF3173F6D27A8FF51EBB4826E95FE
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x1C235FCA26B6BC1B70A4048D8B4A0E5F
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x66F561884CD0C2BF193FD11605D970B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x1EA7118D24FB014402B93307651610FF
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0xC3D669DD4122513BDF94996F6BF56987
room door opened.
0x55D562F5C6BAFDFC94969DC3DE0682A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0x530AE5D0EB856C02FCAAF32E43FACA87
found the room apparently empty.
0x1DB58D74F276ABB5853057ABE0E307E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x214B4C3F6282E647E846227EC6FC3487
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x4102014FD67D3A0D1ADCEF36B266C066
animal!"
0x4A1626E98C8DE8097E552726C65376C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x7AA018228DE8872C3B90A74D2D9D8CB3
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0xAE84A56D2EBE0872F75B64605CA4C2BE
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0xD024F9D6DFD84AA2684CCC902044BA5C
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x8E9DAB37029B6FBB3FBF3ECE331A65AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0x35C450555B91061C21690454A63B1B9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0xF4BD270B31AD4E9C581061735B9DF0B0
forth by the said Jack.
0xA892E13C067BF474BA34872A278AA309

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x5791C7D71AA78C1B967C935DF42E0E82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0x968A812AEA1AC974EBC2325CC8128D3A
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x667FB194F9286A897AA4485775CDC09F
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0x6ED260BE3EF6962466F1B480D3D34C53

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x892BCB5C3933EC170632E680301DBCC8
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0xDF1F1418377CBB08344D4CB41DCF0DA1
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xA1990B585762D1220AD6336758039746
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x2BFDBEECBFDFD120DB6384A0845EF444
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x0DFE1B29056F504B84E4EEF2A99D1FBC
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0xD80A752377EE21F20F87433F738F14A8
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0x1E8863A66F0DA18D48A5F1BB5118A1EA
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x40ADFE6413E5914D8707F5055774FB06
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0xE6D5C2A8CF94DBC7414284C9E18AE43C
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0x3921D03704ECA6685BC593F7654BB84A
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x2F7320B90EB829937D042521D17C5A43
home.
0x8FE5153CA920D44AE2E52A9BE103DA54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0xC171E4462156934EF2E96F9E9B223D8F
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xD405F3B8BB214845194712743C8FA8CF
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x75CF1987A77037C9A26AED0C44826A8A
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0xF7B679B5171EBA5122DECCC5A8025FF4
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0xCF625A84BE936EC318FFE29BDF4760FD
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xF078321A4E9E72AC5DCE365A989C69CF
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0x7E2FA15A009B0553F835E2224BAD76D4
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0xD64B3FA97FCE67C850A3A6E956EDE511
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x52BE7488F01EB919A25638F8098447B7
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0xAAA7BE8053A4E34293441292F952A934
her back.
0xC78F1B3160C31AA74CFA73E90A078FC6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0xFB31B9C8BD4FEA237DB92C18AA680F03
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x5AED1C89A6F260CF9BE48530686E786F
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0xCCAE00D88115FB21F391BEB572A8165E
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x8B2088C7A22A93C0AEAF6B751C85E75C
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0xEBFE4007955F85A77F787BFDCAE7B935
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x75AE6744DA1FBCD1E744C59714513725
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0xE349C2963F88960C51759B4152C5AB99
chair.
0x64C0DC8446847DF088681DADB9B3858D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x3F09E37551069F3908B5421AC3E91777
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0xEB28C2E541F1D80B879C91D59F8B6ADA
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x027CEF0C1ADE04B6EB94B19365BDCCEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0xE016361DBBB6BAA98778DE3CF5EC2E54
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x604CC00330F06CE18C8C732F3BF2ED8F
insult.
0xA25F584495E400B65B54E1737FB94E40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x772C85D7A3ACA16EEAC27C9CD586C4AB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was reading."
0x0C4C6370C88466D83DF46C240FCE4F22

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Show the book."
0x26DBD7EDCB84BD310108D4DFF4C4293A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0x1268FA70E898D4EE9EABA42DED7D0DE3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x1CFD74C8A52075F948C6F11F1B291A00
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xB24EE2916C36731CCC814E05E5C10BBC
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xEE9818C2DEB13A37B38345A462B0F7C6
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0xC829B76E25789453F077300048D6B70E
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xC40518131CFD942C40DF5F89A6344C43
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x85EB80A9BFC9B894A422DD9B735F99BD
the mirror and the windows."
0x41BEBEE6D67BD903217F38FD13265090

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xC405777F06E7AB7393B38A6319160456
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x4A22B4B511B300CBEE2379B779E31FB7
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x2AA9508B70F46072999468EA6EBD0C60
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0xEF454141F4A2EF344E4F520D6CB265FE
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0xF7DE4F9E81ABACEDCD71EEA3A569A93A
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x76ADA862F41F8A7DA9D0EA77839B934C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x13AC703258D867BCAE2EE76A7EB93508
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x448C405ED43F627F5E55BD2EB6369804

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0xB26027DB471AF5B374FC190CE1A607D0
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x2BAC456A9975E95CD505906DC996B671
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x148D9366BBCAB1115905C07658BDF042

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0xA558AFD74B991B643D8E2243F0E9DB41
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xEDADA9299E214CB9DDF64B0ADDF1E7B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xAF49E915904FB0F1F5161281DE9ACD6C
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x7EB7EC8BBE83D421C44D712DEE4D091D
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0xEF0F62930EFED6A4DFFD62B6ABACBAEE
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0xEBD7FCD71E639A4CD01438AE374F39E6
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0xAE8735F19AD7F93A4C16A81CF16C8C94
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0xE909A14CC6690E41F8F47BD250514C40
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0xB4518AD9D783181E4941055FDB8B66A4
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xE285E876BB5949FCD2EE1A40EF6CF30E
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x77A0223DB7E327EBA053908167731833

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0xCE974013F20F8DE184AF5B1309CD8348

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x056007C3761259584D57DDED5D03FB40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x547F094E76FBA4B2B6890FBAAF78A0A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x7CD67B602CDF6AFFB4E0FCF3969A2DF6
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x5C280FD9AC6622DEA258BC9A6E6D7602

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
CHAPTER II
0x0C14E10A5A8678B4B3B9BA5A30FC8394

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0xDC3BB559AC82AFC96B80A5ABAC93D26C
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x9965D807D7A06C7725C198ACE9D9C0A0
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0xBAD9D4D5D284BE81F0D1A430BD41D66E
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x22E0AE41C86BF7D67202EC651A498B5D
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x0B60473C9E4890AEB280E53689B2F9B2
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x2C5E87FEDEF49ABC0B46D9BD53AA96A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0x9C71B445B8403936AD585DDEEA0E66BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x956FA7211F8AA82F98A383E106F899A4
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x41FF7EA6A05C2308490782B7B589C37D
young master."
0xADB0ACBD078FA1963D0EC25A8FF4DBB6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x874D760CABA3CB48009E84ECE109C853

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0xEE72082B81D2F7ED996C60CD900A3860
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0xD871BAF3629BA89A8A9C325D0D18F000

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0xA5C996F8642DA79F3B09FE77B9360037
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xA4675B1F6A6996A7219AB23DF1E2CD23
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0xE88EB00BF18FCA12DF671CBFBC47146D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x39A949175B84E0F9F966E393BBEE3556
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x04926837F5561AD5D270C27A9964597E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x7704ED79956C16ECB600BD3168D297A7
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x4D7E3FECCF9D2E3194D8C7FAA4EAD3C5
little of the excitement out of me.
0xD761E9E60AD697504546177AD68359E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0xAD502AD50A86A68ABC466FD92266C303

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x74D8511DA38DCFF5FD6D1671FC36FA13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x6DE373273BC16BA8B00F5227586FC982
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xE521DDB71E0C58250A14ECBB492D7060
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xDFE9D4D79987371433AC9193A4BA5128
incredulous of my sanity.
0xEBB5C6AF12B56AE1E7423820BF9B1B4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x680F33A1131CA2BE4FB8EA30C3AC5F34

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0xE065BA9CDD64075380E339B1D2966B5D
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0xE4DDF9836F37C5B145CDC3E712781283
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x0C2776D38E226A283E9A4433D04DFCBD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0x1FD8AE5CCA5F09AEE013C82E33081B12
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xA9FB60CE91A5BC8D6679198C905FE4AD
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0xF881CC928DCD302A7307EAEC6F8CA26F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xEC60E6D23894548315C2C2F01085F616
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xB4DA053C0EA09F051644165FE69C89BB
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0x71D0A88CFF121420180A654DCC698D0E
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x599CDED821274C29936982CE20C1A844

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x28BE11B86B71FEFE4656CC60ECD4D20D
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x1D474DF81E869645B5E1C3D54D59E09E
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0xCBBC727B99C4FC1F59938EA70937A3D7
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x076E3194E3B759D4522C49DF3351DFA0
them."
0xFF3883E10FDC5D2ADAABB63EA6D5FE4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x2A250F6D22F1FEB0C680B782D54F36CD
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0xE2D9A37C0DEECA76FA0F355CC281626B
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0xC393EEDB8D9203374389B6582E9C984C
away, I am sure."
0x286C75196A18C7B6B710541B07E6BE8F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x98DA133DC6CF4A7C033C0CD9F1CA6C12
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xFACAAF49C5258CE943B0B774B6ED790C
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x069FD249F73A62304FB80ED52EAFC386
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0x02542E8979FFF220B207069F3E084E89
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x596B8CB3B33248D4300CC748C1E19F1B
fetch you away."
0x1FE757DB9D322288A46556326E2DBBD1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xABCC9D5252C36A32820C1E603929739F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x42555CD371222C451124FD7DC743DFCB
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xC033671804854EF2AEF14455AAD78F9E
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x4585835C4F86F860373F9DE0DED4D30C
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0xFBF4264F12790749DAB06278F519D3A1
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xF51D15B791D93E84523302EE2853B376
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x855E9CDE7C46A39A87CBDD715926714F
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x5771C62EAE87AA9540E8E760B3CBCBA4
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0xEEA98C67A4762196ADD622729EA68EEC
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xBF082BF042BC2343C407C2D68371646B
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0xA359DD3336D0AABDA146B52B9B15967C
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xE8551E9732F3DE00DBBB6715BE712E45
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0xC04487C5B7A2B4F0B5834022C7E5860E
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x822DF38867ADC72AA09825FDFDF643DC
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0xBD41F782D8F8651CB3D762108EB8B739
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0xAD2EF62B3E3BFD3D1F87E9D9E9005241
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x2B8D521B1CFD2FA847574330D11AAF78

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x191D2B4CC28AA4413DCF3FACF5C8F7F3
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x9D3C5084738E936FE5FBEF509C2B9525
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0xC27844DDF2982463FE04BBA87C229713
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x8D682C2653619309E87711BD4B123CB8
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x8461F18F996F2713A731C8FBBE2358CD
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0x4C0B2B8B9147B4FE9C84CF4A2BAA0CA4
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0xE26C5513ADF8B8E567522AECF0B7E01E
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0xD851C67F71A35722DB8DEFAC7F90DCBC
in spite of its grandeur.
0xBCE4E5B5244849ECC0BF8C97145B15C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x77E5E4210EB2FD5E3D3BB85CDD2ACE8A
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0xF5582F5E409100FF0F10075B83538109
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x3DBDA7DD3A51F550744347B142437241
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xC60B410328D11674FD92A073262CED2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x19D1076C117B73534FD8ABE4488A9791
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xED3EB4CAC7153B882498C2FDA3D04114
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xFDAEA373C88260BBFA4CA072E23CA98B
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0xFF73527458155AF0E143F044EDB8E2B5
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xDB15F85B67B5D3AE11DD9F786F1A6E38
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0xBE7341EE60B94D48150B9BAA50C88BB1
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x0B05B695FF27FC2570C26ABF25A6D83C
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0xDF2476776B3AE3FA00831E4F2FF0B153
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xF476D2F985DC111FA31B9504FBAAC638
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x779F8D6AD1E44F530ADD31D572218D01
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xE3D788C2BA1FBFC0C750ADCEBA220154
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x9FF58FEBBC51A4CEF4069ABE9B8F43E2
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x382ABFC4C4F9DB0E701B7D70A6036FA8
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x35271B93A36CA72813E8B2844A28630E
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x35314CF332F4CDF953FF885949E048F4
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x263C489F7B947F48D4851CD67423F3EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x10A1059CEB4E4282C5BD7ECF4A1832C2
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0xA7FDDFF1EAF21692674F9B33BACB6279
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x861257A809E2EB95359E8F8AC17BA12A
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x4586ECE833BDD6851B7D2FCD4DFBCAED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xB043B62E3761A0955D3A7A70138F30AF
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0xA90FAA2CF656E4C6A4836AE8273D47D5
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x709BD631B5EB14E1B4B7154B7CD4FC1D
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0x91B390326A885FE8661ED50DF288E425
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0x3B4304C284A268E56EDC46BAC4936A94
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0xBAE82B26FB9CF0AC315D245056148DF8
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0xD8126216557EE06FD822A39F848D22E6
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x0F05CAE82B32B6811BC64F0F2BBA8B9D
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0xFB6FC86C349C6BE0BD6FCA5A9975C44C
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x85E0830A677C081DC19F0A2E521F45C9
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x4A9F04B75C77FC4CF133C27112F18589
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x8C674A5B12C1F60D86AFF4B5E7FFFF0E
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x69182350577E5F2A0980F83D6B46254B
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xF81DAEFCFCE1EEBF46571A2371C1C922
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0x32262D25A9803247BFE539A2DB87695E
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x96308D7501AEBC53B9CADBC0430B69A0
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x81066500D9B538D4CA47BCE06802029A
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x472F4AAA2E28E77237E20A753EF2686A
night.
0xBBA939A0F7CF4FE1664F19C5BED15FBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x049BD7F69C7D5AA239FB599BCF8C349A
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x99A1ABA5DE46BBEEC47F00515B460FBE
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0xCB2CCD897B707614B60238FC37DDE868
general opprobrium.
0x275FEC6A673E191687264DF7B3B44B2A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x1C8D2619B8025F4E304239865F07CEC7
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x9597EE12168CF3020E2FF522E37E1DF4
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0xF6D8D01443863D704E0D335729BACF2F
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x55EAD262EB642A150774DCAE38AD78BF
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xA48792F8DF0F48BBE3BDC3FCA06D950F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x8EE57E1CB240D3C19ED719D318FF9F04
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xAD8F11E1709F18CF3192B85C26660E44
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x36D4F22CA0174A610E31596CB59E1C9D
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xD86E48DEB763D9A61D7F9274A1519742
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0x2EC1EC22412F72ACBFA6D3A18B2A8953

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xEB9BE2E206D2E2F487E7ACEA48A0CF84
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0xCF2FA926CEA2BACB3705C573A2307F3D
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xA62BC3ABB7B3EFDA77D9A038D1C7B81E
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x2B27B6D6B199DB288C8B7816773C61A3
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0x967DC143F3810FC17C22E1D85C355C6E
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0x63BC704639EE701EFE59384DD53AFDCD
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x28B88AE620CFC79DE3A0EF9A6F78F782
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x04B3196B53D7A16E8CB51DEF956593A2
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x9DB2EDF9FBA8F467DD17FE9F21CE0609
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x6B5933948DE847F4E554CBF68FF9BB73
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x2F50D7BB2399005FADF16B2CBB5BE9C1
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x952D4FB4DA12D950ED95E2BA47786D4E
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xECAC198434D1AFC7045ED00FE91F2CCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x58240EB56924C7E5EF82701F610F8A70
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x1C34DD55AC7CC34F9F7AA0DE025ED0B5
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0x459647AD21BD538A4AB23A7909B65396
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x4ADFD1C6C46DE9A96D8F04118F70681C
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x0E00690BEB498B352246619215AB2A14
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x0AEEBF45FEDBA8E3312A1015C921DEB1
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x3F39626879CDCCBB17D6603A4B2D5341
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x1D1FD68893DF75EA46D3D115F773D334
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x0AB7CE2A47EA72D4E1DFFE3F514C3A4C
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0xA9BD435690A0062B3E76BC9871F29FE4
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x80C160C65AA2C77ED95DB45DCC1DC26E
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0x8EBE832819E0A48DAD3299E26C53A10A
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x78B6CE00A017BF02551FAB5DA6F0F8A1
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x32A32B996E21444E8EEA679E425CC6F5
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x60DE1E216B6962934A4845CED0DE073D
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0xF1A1EE55C48FBF02E9369DB792DE08CF
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x7EBF4B771341A5B9FCABFF78E3E2795B
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x6F044D130314310C8346FF85669E8F13
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x1770C09CA4632299A560A15ECD4A5BE4
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xEC9FF77F77187BDC7F781F3A4C66A43A
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x3E872E3DD40EA60C3909B4E0A007E8C5
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0xF2106288CD628389F4DD173735BC790D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x88B0517410CE0573C5F37A06C363AC86
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x320E6615B2B40A9A743112050A1C8BE0
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x3A470666937811E0C95FD0C6FCE08FE0
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x01AA4EFA46C92C0FEA8D4B106C39EC91
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0xA647945916C63AC23E57BBBEC667F1D2
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x7F5FE7754E0EA2C8F10B35E7BE8B8C12
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0xDEBF1ADC12AD2FA73A86264F3A9428CD
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x8DA77C841E1A598C4B76A35747B8AC77
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0xF16C0FD70F21F72076A5F7E6331E014C
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0x2A2A0D12DA2D1394A7A806A8DCA83100
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x01BDEE3DA2CA383E9F3AEC65040657B5
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x72F4DBC6670E84BCA23050AA0417B6EA
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xA63DF5ED83A6DEDF1BC1F6EF37AB222B
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x32D87F231DAB4000B50D2450C4EC33C9
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0x24CF0BFA1443AAD0B19EF205260AD3E1
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x87391F5DD9218D6CD04C3C2DB2242633
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xEEA0238AF3832DE0E7B6B8B832BA4C55
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0xE216F80C81A91BB68650EFF98AB82791
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x3E8704D322474FC047055A2625A362F0
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x36D810700284C83893AB7848037589B2
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x5CF7CFA976995FA7FA974B7834876F9D
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x8D9EC60849927B32938FC24A81B06421
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0xEA5CD6AA70F7C678E33DB85C6F0CDE8F
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xF63A32639EFB6565E3181DC1A08905D9
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0x7CE3A565543F920BD8D75DEBDDCE57C8
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0xC0EEBCA01D2F4C8D0476ACAD4F456192
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x13AC5D5286F2AAD2C8D1C0C39516B357
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0xC9D1EE65CA6BE792D5361BFFD65F8CB5
Abbot entered.
0x1618A99FCA5EC3AC6E61B96B3E2C8CC1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x9AF4384C18BEE531E608FC41FDDE947C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0xB40D62D9342456D54DFA4620F27B5C56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xF9AE9693FA2E078433DF512A23F84480

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0x3E9696D266304F51C1BAE7E6830B4752
Bessie.
0x4CC8A37BB76CEC2593A7FA61CC06D2F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x6FD8ED0C76481E20767DB4EB7DC66107
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x1E5B38EF50777790933C60C44573AE7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x37B7CEEE0464034C578B413F9CF9FB50
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x089BCD5393DFAD655B81B2295A5E1829
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0xF5AE76B75D07BC814F9C53986CF7AC97

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xCEB6733C7E300D8433D8E7240C389532
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x35DA253CA7E856BA36EE686511E7A5F9
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x1C7F86B111E727B0DF6E1979E2F67869
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0xD921DBF0338300D41DC103C0E477CDCF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0x7A1D9801F76A5BD1084A5A1B60EF56D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0xCA15F1ACDFE0C417A4E620F263061FE6
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x49434A826ECE0CCB811817B5256DF960
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x21A533A40E129DA9DC686716DBB1CCE9
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x67BF973A1E51E4B92D54A2EB236BB2AA
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x1C975210B58F6912D700906BBD5748C0
then."
0xC1B7862A5E35D80A8E42FE8D6E952AD0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xEFE24EC22B731FEF966553404E81BC7D
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0xFAE88AFAAC22301A75EBDAE5383441BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0x72CAB791878EF61FC447D9626522A77F
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xD52ADBA532F42F7E1325FFB69CAFF95E
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0xA0CA0BB86E489A83F9AE2CE9DC5E6D0A
duplicity.
0x8ABF7F5CF9F149157CBD2EF907C554E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x78E8BE8EB79FB83CBBE1EA57042FBB20
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0x85DDA082FBED0F46E4CA5E3DB82703E2
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0xF8095E65976512A23D71EC8DEF02AA8C
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xE76CDFA1EA15BE04BC670839A1A1C303

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0x6937A6A1DA3928192C8CFEE550C126C0
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x93184B95975547F250C23CF6499EBFEC
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x0F4E186BE95FAFAFC6C6F34CD1F88394
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0xD136861161E4667BDC50041077CADFB0
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0xF79D928DBCF5C9F5877854AD58BC23C7
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x525B81D8314B5742ABD8C53B383E89B2
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x342C454633325FA453A1EDB25A756D0A
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xD338DC86A53170DE2EEB433DC5268490
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xC74D56DF921BA288D00C7F78D0BE26EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x3C8B644244A6F00D1CFFE84F0C16FFC2
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0x0E4537760A807DCF672CB2005991D955
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x075124F91E36263A04D465683718D1E4
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0xFC82FDF86B41EA66143A3AD1DF77BF3C
pillow, leaning over me.
0xC4B39B34B0CD1CF2F329CBAACD00D70F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xFEC0D54DD135DDDC5C663F3197828765
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x6FD8A0CE6113ADF7C936BE9BD17B873E
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x88373509DC72BE46497D722ACEB6530B
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0xA9913F40CC5147810388D9BEE82673F1
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x0F08F4039836DC4A4FFE9EBCF43F3A0D
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x360BEF58E077EB191CDED2A47F524C77
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for

herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x453FFB8E1255389D96520FF988AD55B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0x293CFCDF65C1F4118A8761367DC178A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0x23B47A061B9715A3EC2B1994E9E25201
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x2CD4D4DB1239375C4B776A50FAB86064
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0xB1208EA4DA0A414C64B1B28167BA5E00
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0xB8E33756276EC077E2129F84F443FC53
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0xDCF7F6C4ED6733725866BDADBFD6325D
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x4CA801CB8124310EFA349A50874A7504
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xE0F0EA938BD9EF69BF1C05F4E2BC52BD
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x521857C4FCBECB9F93B491580325A63C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0x6C629152A58B6A2995E0720353F3E044

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0xBD145B95A331546392FBCC18E3A43F43
rough.  "I will try."
0x8B3652DACF309A9C84F2EF40A3EE3A30

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x534DF6A7F102D14D6E8CFDE4FBAD60CE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0xA9B2A019781588DA201CAAF6F7B4D932

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0xFB2E5F9E8062A67B7A4E3ED6C0818E49
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0xDDE71A230D6C78249FA83BAED6E048B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0xFBC09504705A23C9576299481FF5924C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x0090A6F7B72D2E071632D1B6654CFFEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0xD387839F638EC5CADC615D5D04B1FFDB
soon, no doubt."
0x19B0B1C4723C3918413A91A9F7C5C116

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0xE02D754FD8BCE89A9D7497E0F0CB7477
say--
0x00558997872F6DC5B78C7ACECE28B8FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xB34C05AE998DD626C60A73F271E850BB
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0xB5B5EFF9C8A43F779BD30A6C5404B1C4
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x4F12EF7E8C8CC90913E56827B4E84412
rather too hard."
0xC157F0FD2B9162D708296024525511A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x9B68A01A3C758C697831218DB9E0ADFC
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x2A4394D77068FF8169122703CBFAD5DE
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xACFCAF11D6349C2726BD88D2074C3B8F
the main subject discussed.
0xE417E52821373947096B9662EB62DB69

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x230BFBD209BF7AFFB740F476CEFA5CCC
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x61EAA89D45435BB8B0AFD4F698735C61
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x8C00C2F8037E98C8308722D3A03D741A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xEE50EBF6807637162270FAF224863320
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x65DC9D4D5F541626523B378B123C8F4A
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0x545AD1DF2DB35509128B203C077774B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xBA5C79DBC5219A6B143C7ED95D28AC08
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x34DAFA28059A9903BDE22F542247FAF4
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xE00845C5315BC45A6C9E9FB491E9A7DE
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x2D6CF4D37334E1B38805DD105E94A435
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0x047503E11A16E687576C874D20E36D26
bad propensities.
0x7C397CDBC88AA92D2FF449355E37F29E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0x3CD261ED12B85A9C1D63891A2A0BE873
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x8E393DA723477F90C1EC5F8E7297C66F
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xC3ADFA9FD792AF3C924F491D91953B51
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x33720E64C2835F8353690F879D6F13C0
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x5B0F74C2775FC35B9C0106F2510537B8
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x75E8605EF91DE26EC59ACE4282AF8C3F
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0x97D3C36652F5439A4D5BFA2EC907F2C2
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0x60A22682E712E8773BF83262F45EA4F3
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x982F2857BB4DB5637F0C1D8C81285AD7
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0x540D1E9F38C8042DDD86C0505709453E
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0xDD405492C0E26ED14BA3E98576EE62B1
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x1B190AB25F878B00E981223513D6D375
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0xDDDFC619FD5DA9D5D1C6C8E639007ACD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xEC4ECDD2F36BC7D502723C1ECFB2D62A
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0xC3D645292F3D09F6705B968BF8AE2ACB
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x29719B42B6C57FA903898BD347373FF1
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0xD9A27E8760801E3DF65891BD340117C8
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x12DF4617BC90265F79CDAAB833324AB2
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0xEEBFD6BAC5B295289A48B27958237660
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x2134EEDE619CE14311FF688729385CF3
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x8B8D521D5DBD41EBE84D41F2F7B023E7
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xEA7C35CEE2E6B01DB5C93AD958810881
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0x8BDAA9A7EF94B7141B431B8071D20632
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x83F6B6836CCA83A8A7ABE9B8EF30718F
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0xAC5AE02D48AFD5BF2B2C6BA6962600ED
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x4F04F04866018316BCE3EDA72CC70CA7
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0xE60363FC6FCD340751594766B3F46CD0
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0x3F6E705853944A5CDABB6702DB5724D3
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x326017CA1A9DAD2F8E26E736323ACC01
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x934E6893F5EDCB78BF1DAE8BFA14F63E
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0x02C2934CD39709E38FA28B2056466F0F
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x746FBE3EF7AA7C84B5B6CF55217C9D03
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x7C465BF481503F09A525AF782748EE9D
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x9248CA4AC69E7BB7F8BDBB1838244DB4
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0x9A25EB6B4E8551DE1E038401032F14A0
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x4B060DEC5BE57EA32AC66CFFE0EB661F
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x13B58FF362E967BA07C94786200F9808
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0xF7E381761F698DE1397F3D4F21258F22
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x7D66B26869B1337997E7618705F6D6DF
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0x6127C07AB2509F1810E16E21239FABCA
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x6B3B39C0304A8ED45C80663DB9B38718
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0xFF6AE3DDEA913349C00E9BEF5A4268F7
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0x8502654482A8B4A3F0D377144AB4B740
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xE9AAC0A2B2CA7E85FA4F750010CF3B08
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x5B74D4DDC7C7E3FA6C30F2C4F6A271F5
untasted tart.
0x6F3501760A55CB7ACAEF743FF9F9904B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x89CF22025D516A82D420538CFA840689
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xF1EC020B6102188A6DAF91D81D980EC1
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x8A0C3194C273237D4D48F136579A9148
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0xE124CD2A75CED0664F3DA4ED717EFA2A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0xA991EED78C2F13D376215B9810445EDE
      A long time ago."
0x82D2FFE6F85E436DEBE4F30B8764E91F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0xEB00413E8690704E2D7128C2FCA490F5
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x0206F92BABD32C34B78ACD18AD384DDD
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0xE660A1188D15A1B054B2C705347044EA
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0xA79ABA57BC1A7DB322896C6D563ADDC9
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x3C5F4562326EB53AA8AF84ED1BD94D09
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0xEC62F1709529F8992358F1A2C365C49F
one.
0x2E8FFAB7C1743A4823D293D2370437CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0x0132165794BBB312C99195385568CD4D
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x62871399B5B742E579CC7C9FF777BC8F
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0xF09B71DCA352013BA75D1067F8CABAE2
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0x6158B637ECE3BC6F090BBBA469DF3376

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0xA6F065AF6C121D6384C6DB2A8F90637A
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x17316B3617B9326E0BB1794056A45DB8
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
0xA851764879E41EFC0D16ACD676C8B416
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
0x4F90644079F3ACC8A827E937DB489385

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0x81E9DD753F51128083B04125D9D04BC1
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0xD65D55953569E2B414AEC79621B5D92C
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0xE9DAB86F0579233EB2B8FACE7E05CDC5
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0x8A63ACB43301D83EACB8BD94F1D7C014

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0x35C0779B13F17D83F5F553038035B11F
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0x81FC3C70F20C9A4535EB80C7DBD4FC61
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0x40645232F98774C3E32A58C22C3E013A
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0xA6D5D3F6F2E7D97239AB8C262E1B8797

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0x2AD0147C62B11AB1DD1E0544A1E2603C
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0xB9EB664D731204FD5CA2BD6C05FBFFE2
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0xA38476859D411F21A86208648890B7F3
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
0x04D73309216EF4527D3163018F95B947

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0xFE5CF29C103CEF95F94B1F08A1E88A33
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x12D9AF14E95BC1BA9041F1C511365141
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0xEBDFA6C8C362075F83EB706FA1692080
Lloyd came again.
0x06A2CFF57FD51CE5C5D8CA01C74A03E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0xDD0BBAEF95A5E5F7AA9165A31EEF9118
how is she?"
0x9AF21D6BDDAD83AA77C732CF33975C3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xAB1F798FEF58D2444E9496027ED60C3D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0xA81B0CFA1C401068D15ADADE1BBCE0F2
is Jane, is it not?"
0x5A9B493ADBA9E32FE856760D313C5121

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0xE987A3AB760F96EC58F1FF66528F64F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x42D19016A5E61BDDB7395B78386E9241
Have you any pain?"
0x6FC9384217F58A8A0244C1913F89EA07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir."
0xCCC46D19079AFDAFC76975E486C8E90F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
0xFB3802C41378942CCDE0F6F2D216D8EE
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xFEB591D594B2B01C62EAA92BD48C6A12

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0xFF6230FC7EDA4B36A850767F5FC92F94

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x40621955F0D3190EC3AC522C45CCC2CF
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0x5D1AE2E5238D1ABCF9C92C863313CA3A
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xF798F6EC48AEE855AB6E261FAB20A5D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x8D6A89F4B89ECD6F93B7B70DA93633B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x69ABA9D39B82688E12CFB0B2ED9A347F
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x6476E2307C8DF97CB83033F03A698242
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0x2C363EDB13465F23FAD60BCBB3D3B92F
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0x79BE289C07CC51B094F64B45D2E20FE1
leisure, he said--
0xE1B157AF152B4957CF40F87462A3AC49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x6837BE82159E5FA7A9673297DECD0817

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0x88BA4FA8B87ACB1AE90A19AE720D1033

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0x4B4CAD2C21E8487CDCBBDCB96C7F41F8
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0xAFDDEA0D92AC40633AC82AB14193348B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0x2E2F050BDEC7756C270FB1F7898E8E34
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0xB001A3C1829DA9AC401E88A99B8E91D0
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0x27837E3DCCC253C1827A88D8698F8A82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0xDF6809838258036F115D7E863F035E95
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0xED5F1E455F34A99B6D04EC6D86AAB15C
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0xDE72A7A61E80B10CD13F032DD7A6E0D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0xCC17AA22614E4880181B1B27FED13361
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x2935907C269D110FB1695EC827D1F3EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x7B51B358E2C9180F6A33301C5E1ADD3A
Bessie was gone.
0x42407D1CA36229563718B118999E5F64

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0x88B39DC431CEDB94E4E3A29F2A1C5DA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xB5A130858330F177442F493340E13415

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x977D08A681F86073CA05D677E566AAE0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x84F125E04C0A3B1D920C8E0FDEEAF3CD
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x6B5AFD16890591954AC62087CFE5C154
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0x70480001326273CDC6C91B7758072307
that I think I shall never forget it."
0xB071667A4ED56999A4A61CA026EE0FC8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in

daylight?"
0x6F2AE067AB91B9946F1D5101B8C0B8C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x24712295E1DFD6D3B53D271D6E3FC25A
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0xACB38BC2E7460A41FD01BB2922BAFFB4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0xBCBA829DC2F97ABD64EF30F401C327D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xC1DAA8847CF4D6A99BCD2D6B7FBEBC98
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x478379D50932CE0F10F7134B9F410D04
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0x4C9390063DCF1481B0BB42B70E6FBB4E
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0xD2D1C8175DED4751EF4A4B6ACAC8B4BE
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x41D9BFF18CCAA50FBD0939F091627D70
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xFC177466A76D41826F985C7D4393780B
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x7F8AA3153AE4640A83086F29295CCD42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0xC7935AAF30F4D58E737B25A3422AC91C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x25528F301B7040C6642576A69C3350BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0x4DD9C75983DF9278D66F87312BE4E372

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0x02DB8C4CAD483964B32EE8EC979263F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xB80265FD32C94F857FB0FC636E27D19A
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x230B1AA14D57EBBE62234A771092D4CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0x1478958F711085648051E87795F771B2
than a servant."
0xFE1120C425E01DD5F3941A948391E1A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can

never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x5C5641F698F382C343AB11CE3DE31397

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0xA2D4BFD07AFE0B7AC1098BFC96397694

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think not, sir."
0xF19A8309C42D16C6A6CA2E70BCFE4CD2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"None belonging to your father?"
0x81D3787B02176E6194BB1726B7B7BCB1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xB8B56CCAE8BECCEB4151BED307737008
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x77ECE60F11FD6221380CAD6925C5CE81
them."
0xFF3883E10FDC5D2ADAABB63EA6D5FE4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x5AF3ED4E39373854C6D6BC99575EEEB7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0xB11FFC04E8E0CE6328EEA0A2DC2C07FC
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xEF20ED07D39EA84071186D66C6FEE0D0
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x8459531A0EE6BA8DE877F4201CD4E257
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0xCF7637BAF9FC23A0016D01F8EB6D24FF
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0x897EE4B9C26578021C6E674B6474251C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0xAA4C5CC90972367BF6EDDC98A2177B01

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x333AB0F9DB4607FA99EF230FABBDEC67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x6B028CCFF735223FDAC27C9F4237CB36
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x0F009344207E83FF6D874EDEC0BE995C
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x6DF3CA0D49554C1DA8909583A4A495FD
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x68775A9E4BDE85FC149E30F530ED9AB5
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xB788566758FDCEC7D3671B8CC041D5C4
the price of caste.
0xF0AC56290F9555E17189B23204D41C1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x6D578A23D188C2EE56A01E9CAF7D4F44

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xE6E8EDE48E6616F844DBB6B898A9D3FE
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0xEE00792B7B5F070A0F5EFD20BDBFA594

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x306C6FC21F22CAD3A66133DFF49EEBF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0xB01DBEB7ABB8493CBA0CA77485D39439
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xCB20E9ECE67842EC4E2722FA432DC66C
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x9A204692DCEEDE3B1D46D78E83B60596
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0xCFE7EB08B45A0BA5AD0D4F6BD10A7172
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x1D8B65DB4D6772B870C2A1B43F3351DA
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xCF758AF38478A5D8690D3F9987C32EB8
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0x89CA48AE5535C4B983A4CD602F7308AA
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xAB876978AEC4E3B9883B9EB6741405C5
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0x85D7877678B531FDE4B7DFBBC3EF3488
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0xE02551258D10F930EBA6326D4A940F17
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0xCE8D9A57D74D647612A5A39B1C9B68BD
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x46710D9578AE8083C83D4F7233AAB9FB
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x6D242276BFFB3BFE4D6A77EB2CAFB405
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0xE728CE09179CEA347014C29602726A82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0xBC775BF76003673D8D1E44E6523C667C
musings.
0xF53BB706E72D56E220AADAD01C48D8CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x4C8E9D2CC72571E8E8583448C33FD0F3
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x700F413408E78E8C74A213D1D408370F
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x0023043DC6FFEAE338E03216ABCE85B8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0xA5A5DC3DFA1EC4B517B7080CA95498B3
the gravel-walk.
0x1971855D71F0DD9D6D0D5C89400580A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xC96251877C20972AE27DE1AB9D04C0AC
to her before I go."
0x124A1A42B40954B7529E2CB147FA9FED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x5A10749AB24F0CDF8AF1DF2A7442261D
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xC30A42E6C3DC13E31F6CA3312AD70D96
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x3E2E7B71111B0CA2D80D7D25127FB461
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xE4CFADB59B3EBAD4A08ED202EDC4877D
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0x163F7F5E507DD554730BA52A61766F0A
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x38D49C04F01E6D7B9996440D93A7F63A
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x6BD54051DC530187477CD988FB548F88
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0xC225EF6ED29F8E8B271DDFE892EEAF65
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0xEAE01922EFBA18600896F1B9820389F4
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x09FFC2F2349B57A462C9469042F38605

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xE878DF2D7608DF57AA4D0AC0738CA649
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xFAEFBE440C952DFA7227F0098612DA36
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x69DCBF2FA0DA1F11EDBAEB31355DDCE6
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0xDA0D6BDF3421D4955BEA5677AC99B563
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0xD4F580B7D5D39DD1BA2A68AB3F8B9EEF
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0x8338E2A6CE83A666145024E937BB6342
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x498C6E0F9FD4A4C0FDA2AFC423E6F43D
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x60E55C3F4365EE7E6DD46A842CC14B70
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x6A520B06CFFD021A234C2619C85781F1
of each other.
0xE78C63A0A850F634952E85021D7B7C58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x61D16742C355BC5D86650963B221D365
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0xFAC8C0059627E51DC44D4BDFD3AF0FFE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0xA95B00E26C4488B5F0E18F7474A691B4
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x9CB54EFB99F3363DD51A969C1705D7A4
little toad as that."
0x649C7D97E9710F35604EB80E97C22AEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x4671B1C043D266D0DE8F32C9437E7CC5
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0x6C8461358635B90420933D3C055E5515

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xB78C100146ED5A2D599D4F4323E8A174
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x45F871585F060606B2BC707C252F1675
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0xB62D82E1FEA77774CA5598D066B37200

From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xE8FE5C412431F7AD61D788BB6F7BB556
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x8A79729377691CBA4EE6EA27BC3B8070
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0xCC898E3851F930F497D432A61367518B
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0xD94DF85E69AC79C0F287254319F6F1EA
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x3016C260703C5C4D85445E3011CAE31E
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xAAB55157FED18FCDF84F2421C1E43936
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x60F7230F2D81855FD97935F18A7ADA73
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0x24FE61140217873DAC23CF917EEC5D29
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x1B0818132501EC913EB32B5AE90C6CB5
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x068DB62950587B6B405F63C077470F7B
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x0E6DA34DD8C92E6342ABC7382D245D44
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x02534501879CF575A4530C17887A6984
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0xF121F1687A1F966878A819B2113E8B59
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0x33B3DF59EBD7ADC40C960E99A4255AA8
and rooted aversion.
0x3E0CE61F84208BA908B3B90175E5FC66

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x473DAA65E0325F3D5A1AF6F5F43247FC
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0x61C28E136F15477A0E0CED2CB29DDAE9
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x4858A775C79C5C019A5A7AA58797CE50
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x3E603BA5213596F3D339529039FEF620
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x8AD5272854EB7BD187C88B8BBD2E1A3C
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x08F540F3BE00F45B433CEE0A2082CF89
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xBE1ED0BF6990367EFC77048A31E4BD94
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x1B55478A5F3909F4B196AE950483E4A8
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xCF687543641331B7FB6FA1ED46721382
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0xC1D7FCF51548D9EDC08643A2C0286E98
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0xE71F605EC92A69DC59EC90273E58A634
was stopped rather harshly--
0x3CF1C2D38029EA3F873F9D7923B0E78F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x99E619A0B34B88BC11FAD9409D8ABF29
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0xF7216C0C789724DAC07E21B2D5E8097B
should associate with her."
0x4E86ACEF8D16C877C959BE31695864C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x4CA529FC88A85CC502BE31C2F8FED79A
deliberating on my words--
0xA18CA477E4521DD8F012971E9BAB3C96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x7A3644124B69FB2D4DA0861EF8325676

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x8886F2A81BA9E1CD152826DA889E29FF
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0x5934615A372DA3748C670E33A4A16856
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x36AC60FA817357365849DE0836169CBB
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0x5A911F1646D855CE53CF9D4506496E53
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x05988EA38C0C307369FBD6E086F27B58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0xD452C5FA610AC54BF7E7D9BEC9B4B36A
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0xFA56C5C370EC386E5F53F5697B4FE01D
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xE65168765729627D0746267A65464911
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0xCA789059A98CFA6C03C1053EB5D27C1F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0x8F6C455A7D3FCE86D5DE71AE08EC708B
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x0561ACE9E527E4A0EA264107052C5508
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0xA9DFCCD6591A64260BCB084777A1AB7D
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0xC4A264066F5CB1DF625CE4A79D3918F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x6236984C9709D68261146B43C6D5DBC8
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xCA7739E56DF86A08AD93805ACD27ADEA
wish me dead."
0x4AA6321F830190D66EACD705B9D982A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0xF35EA0903886C69F4F63F6C20A64C80F
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xBD6185CC2A42E68DB58E13471F679788
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x7CA7F97AF7EACCB359FE87BF75689CC0
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xD88DCD48A23ECD6031A373267A6C1681
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0xAEE5ED8AD36EE19DCC1FF9FCA6869BA3
in my breast.
0x246E00E7EF0B29FFDB3B2ED6A941E96D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0xE6B87B58861263333206E6EF2626771E
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0xFFF4FF817F2DF0395434AB375EB80BAA
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0xAE69022FCE664163B6B72F57EB348432
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xE563BD6B9765F0D78B6EE3599E9C4F4F
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0x668E21A608B9432A359D937AFD5495C4
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xEC9D5609B768C44D3E7659C688655839
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x5A6180EBA00E5E104595C7E3BBD76546
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0xC28F5B2362C28801BFD0BF0105B39C66
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x5131D3A36793AB0E6F21E028918A24D2
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0x67F737F01A21221E656BD1A1CE992750
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x1ACA64CAF49273AA6B674AF286E55C7B
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0xB522086D2640A006C1DCEE74BD172DAC
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0x6B02A6A59A4FDCEE51DFFF6280EEF9D1
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x13FA348F1B6A3D609410B0E82CFAF055
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0x2E71CD11217245993C62D28503A8A8C5
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xE7E52C7339FFBEF3A7F79F9289826085
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x4D7797CCF2AECB12D29650D6DE27E565
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0xDE247E3D8880FD77A88A5CAF2FF237BE
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0xF08330C3FD4BC454C3F35DDDA19508D2
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x64FE9FB10A2C7B23B4761158A5578E04
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0x0CC032101C1DE4CE114A1A5E67C80600
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x84E2F1A9D7EF2D73E4D64987B85242AC
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x7BF1BA06F5D4713D4C2250BD17369E95
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x362D7F8C98644412E2F97ED3F8EF9E23
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x9B511B6F06D98835D7CFE376A88A970A
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0xBB747FEB4E9DE9D2CBD0FA164BAEBE47
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x9EDB26D32E702BC85767D7B2EA76FB47
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xEA17B0209A3FF5B84D081759FE7A090C
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x8642FA0D2B706FC9A783F7A89C639F5E
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0xA3177DE92FE9FC8015DA391D3F5AE354
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xB1914CB87D5AA0AAE94D929DD94BA3A2
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x77BF871C32C82D77F2CA43D31B7E1132
to be happy likewise.
0x73F3C805B2AF6ACEC4F3B0407AFB5323

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0xF20A16A1D2E4A2EE42F5808914011ED8
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0xBF2EA473DCECB24C1052E8E2520328A9
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x50E318362E7C54EA239D6B2E32F4A802
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0x49F57E8931F33C63F2D860BB9601313A
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0xE2BBD28C3D16DED79D2BF014CBB1E4AB
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x3CCB2454614420394145706A0B06B08C
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0xFD296B38F3C6358FD6F4479257F23F52
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x18BEA84ABFE95BCC5B2735ACF4FFA288
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x4DD3FF1623055EA66A50F39A050ACD90
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0x0D115C0AD60D2257D66146DA7F0F1D7C
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x0054FCB625E248E19A7FA1B21B5970E9
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0x9D773ADA9619B82F4F34A6F489213532
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0xC89B9DB609F9F4AE1827943CDA623D5D
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xAB4B44AB01CAF004ACA3A33DD68D1C02
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x045FD24C4FD04F2E42D6E781EAA6F131
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0xEFD1CC73C3DC0D4DA582FD6844FE6B8A
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x45C9375B3DE146AC1C3539A1D1788D1B
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x566892A3518AE85C3E7AA9C3DE3C047A
Gateshead Hall.
0x149C19F0CB990EF548BEDFC246C92D98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0x86C730255E2746402E7852618FFCD76F
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xCACC3239F3C465529771F20ADC1508BB
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x1A9A960756BC20858CDD8BFD96073846
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x3BE5F7F5A02739A79749445C7E93CC9D
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x97D9F2ABE11650B3079105EA5754448F
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x610EFDFBD221DADDED319CF76DD42034
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x35C586C17241B98F022734C27C885D3E
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x0BA398208D2DA7358914832CBCB97111
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0x11E77C1896090D01382D8A2349154F43
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x628B2327193B317F3AF68A1A72A49283
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0xD8888AE01AB8C39617D958F0ADE262D2
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x3B214A4011B0C2AC0DD8031237DE21FB
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0x35BBFEBECB9C77FA1E434F676294D190
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x599C016201226C0DBD005783D1C85DDE
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xAA0F437CBD8D82637ECB3CD334B48322
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xACA168A8BAA5C3F432AF97BBAFA964E2
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0xE9AED3BAB1F77901B6B8BEEB63E7F85B
accuracy.
0xFC7B3A749A86220833ECFC3D6F46CFF7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x6036351427D99DAF9432EF31F890C17D
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x56749507DD530433CBA4DFFB33A3C2A6
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x2CDCB5E1EAE410C8854FD298F9399922
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x66194214EA99895F51C940DF210B5698
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0xD44566C84757D059C9A2BE6019BEAB74
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x0C11A3ACFC85F9BE3C6CB0FF84BB7CD1
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0x5E17C12167C153485E97FCEE0CCF89FF
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xCCAF81B5721416ECE617D8C273198B02
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x1A322E57960D21D0DAC6E149589C7785
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x3A362E517FB0D07E555FD561DFE1EE4E
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x50C6A6B74BF1D2E956E3770DF472DCF3
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0xC63883C70B5B457F2ACFE443709E6DEC
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0x641A85AA83006409DDB87030F62E9B9F
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xD61C7E22A09E5813FFD37BA95204586B
frost.
0xB16EB16AEF40087860E83BA25815B422

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x1EE2B88CCC18E85057134554D785430C
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0xC329C0A4BA6EF08A77F73F37370649D9
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xA5571EAE963E4171A4F2A5CA28FA02F8
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xB6C4E3A199C446400EC7B425CD367CC3
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x928700FF9CE1132F5F93DA36CAAFA6A0
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x2AD3432794CB4EE0F785AC1B19EA9C6E
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xB104D11F4C093FCCC32A7ABEA2E346A9
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x1F6F4EF2E1D86D002EC751F4873DBC7F
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x10286444ED319FBDEBE957CA2CCB71AC
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xBA86674E9F1E7ECF2E5F783278C7EE4F
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0xEA8071B9DD93F8A988E5902C4E32B2CA
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x3B7A011AF9F3C5BDE8221EB81FE4403C
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0x8195CEA7CC2DB5665B2060B82FEC0294
nursery.
0x3D46306B09853C7455963AFA8D84E663

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0xB84647F0D63558EBF67684C003AD7B7F
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0xCC4C54E7CC85F367B6D158F4688C9915
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0xC7A2EE6131C724A17F8DE4EDAF13FC3C
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x2B5AFBF294958056D02CE017232DA76F
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x9C76170C74F45BF4E699C52AE6E3342B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0xE6E25394157852DB0168150A2FD101D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x96210BA02F10039751F1D8616DD0C50A
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0xF41C28E70CD0A1D4229D57B760A435F9
window for?"
0x563D84446F6E273A3CB75147D8F961BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x0854A3A2441D41C35D7DED957B2DEAF6
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0x3E92DFAD3E2CE201EF0D44231E1CDDC4
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x7CB06A3936D728BEB607CFB5A1FEAD89
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x3DF4A96811CC1B1F40509EDB2ED2FB50
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x9995DCC3B2DED9C27CA54321224A0D32
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xBB38010D47B02E7BDA370D15A8C76EBF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x526AC41730BDA28F5864270D57ADAD28
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x32B5A4B8C7AC0631F844E7571B41B156
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x4FFC8A59468FFEFB64EF7BCB3C8C58FD
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x3812FC02D9A93891C4502C1BA7A75C9D
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0xDDDDF660986C52705F2FA6F0B57BAB30
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x5EB1BF2DA23F115938AD32FA1458008B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0x69D0CEB8FF9DC49DEECD12CF9BEE7DEB
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x84E0BA63F61FEDDBA7EE2EB4FC902A79
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x82908FFED1DDB27D2DD19FB38323D51A
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x47F3FFE3D9DCE8DB461EB0B8AC03B02B
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0xC25143968753D2632E3E82BB69590C19
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x39304D4689601CDA04B917A47158A398

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0xBB131DE1B9059C3921B59CA59EA134CD
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0xA11CF8085A069D6D4B6BCB767629AA08
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x3FDBAB5C3B4AA81514E922EEE43672C6
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x03063BB0D4719099A78770C7C9F5224B
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0xF71441A868EA71D8C10D4293DE4E06FA
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0xE901F70E8BAA5D320C93FBA928A24C56
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0xF4E572F61CE5D2B098EC74CDD0030012
by way of capital.
0x59F41D88FCA15ADBDC855518B8FA795A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x53558646EBD2F3954B2296519F942C9D
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x74E4829244D2640D7D11657BC2BE4F6F
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x5D2040E8B7851D8C2F48B7DDE2E3D359
you."
0x143A288514ECCC2502581C586050AC5F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0x9D8B7F6C6A910BAF98BF2364C87DA212
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x491F58B36907890C1084D9ABDAD5049A
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x6D83FC63C59B8339F761A2421BB0B5AC
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0xC21DBD212E6E96027EA82305CC4A1D76

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ten years."
0x28A52D5F36F6F1C6C9243F1284DB1566

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x6DB0E3EF662571BD828F63FAF1FAAD22
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x966BA76F6BBCF46569B3A618A8CC2C4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0xBF3CF58BD90F5F9FBB66228FB6E48702

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x458EB031347802D7273C7862A846035F
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xEA096C60970447A56683CEC8D36F5080
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0xD18794A038BAED782C3DB28EB8C79C4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x880117704904632EF40098CA24D5DDFB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0xA42FFA8C6D8B6D86FEE15584DB492838
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x3A669A070F54EEA3AFC83D237EF61A9E
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x5124DC0844D8BC90CE1E42F1C445D00E
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x9414BF835D8BAD6E4B8FFD8E2FDC4531

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0xC0E912FA8548CA09532271414B1CF606
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x4C4A7887540BCBC062C87239639DFE55
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0xF4265DF01CA5A116BED226A25282F7D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0xC08C1EF99D4CA72562636FA2943E93BA
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x472FEC3C1C70336BF547FE0EF809E22B
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0xB9979E519078A369EB5DCE794C3D00B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0xE08779E8BC41D94B79FD99FEABBAC13B
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0xBC2C23C34CCC7FE99347799F656F0F55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0xB78F791F406D670A5D8CCFB964996E6C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x0B19D570A7B6A186FB9295949020D629

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A pit full of fire."
0x8A111F7CB20D125213A9AE712E28FFFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x89180BD042FC70B0EBC789D376FDCE8D
ever?"
0x78CF564F5261DCF634B9397F766E0DFC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir."
0xCCC46D19079AFDAFC76975E486C8E90F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x742734BC94D83FC85223011AD19788CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x1358C55DD73BDD5C22026DDF6CC6AE5C
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0xE21A8D04291374C0736F1BC922389589

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0xC41D0A4CA1BF144F7DD8837E03A7D8B3
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x15FCA625F78A7930E94D289701274DD5
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x1A86AF2D6EFC3ACC782447660D416E73
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0xA9CA5F446454F184E2370F790FF36368

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0xAE4C1F8B48DC9A825FEA823DA58C93AE
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xC7E224FD4D45375C8F24938C23A1B519
enough away.
0xF9BAD7D5F3A925DF1B5407415FCA155F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x7F6BBB9D8F4ADD6FFD8BAA56CC42D8E4
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x4913B09F74D349CBF88AA3C764FE073D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0xBFC2D8DDEBC379EE2F8E9FD47FD69BE5
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x130885682575B9EF1065A69B00E7086B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x63877043860BA4D1B2502D009AF78EC2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x49BD8DC1FCACE887C414788B7A09D252

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sometimes."
0xA790A54B500CDFDB6EF9170299C398A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0x47DF49FD6D52A8386C2F613C09EBA61B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xFA6139EB652728A2514E9DF67141093B
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0x59F6B40C26A4CEC1DDC0792841A325A9
and Jonah."
0x40401C2DEFDBC821C79010304B48193E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x7E36209A4E4DD8D98F7A783A7BBC8411

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir."
0xCCC46D19079AFDAFC76975E486C8E90F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0xFF839DED1F329A255FC7B0BEFBBC1B24
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0xFB9CFB4151A7D0FE17194A4FD9B1E570
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x425DF22A493158B305C130120C5D3989
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0x5BF2721878A43718FA129B0AB903293F
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x015F4C3E9DF5C647B2CB0D4940523EAD
piety."
0x582274B8CB08E4944EFDB08C1F148D6B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x5BE32B7BB94528E3AC7CC0E1E29DC5AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x09DEC5C793DE58261C2BE21AF4A28745
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x6D944F2FA83F6388C20E423C20CDD18A
give you a heart of flesh."
0x67E3447A3BE27BCA4224A139478C9D23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x73638B8ACC8423A38E913A7036818F12
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0xD1746C593743B2D8085315A65BA35F09
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x00B06FDA8BA21AB7E9C1276FAB447948
conversation herself.
0x16A6590C68068EF4DECE5B55798696B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0xBB9C2263B7338C6AB47F59BC35426BE1
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xF6FEB99FCDF57D09A3F822F4F854600A
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0xFD418789F708EE0D723BA601AADB4823
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xA44CB35528D529ABA739AAA20CA90841
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0xEE78ECD4FAC9AAB1454CD016F165F4DC
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xB6FF32E5E4A1C21BA068F61D4141FB69
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xF19865602C4F2890C4D34EC7EA287C14

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0xEE5ACD0FF2F4B5CAA54F55D7D35476A5
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0xB12C88806A82E4088DE26AA14A85F229
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x72D6429F67DBB7D201621EA691E3517E
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xEDDCE35440F061025AAC9F806C241A26
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x32B3EABC4E806D83E53969BC55F77346
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0xDE2F254F9EF358916849451F7CB03E0E
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0xAE76A697ECC109220749A6A3F053D384
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x6E01EED5E691B1BCBA5260E048C72D05
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xE7AD8537DEC63D276BF63EACC8939CB2
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0x9B66A86F6CD4A5B8CDBFB35DEBA41264

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x10C5DAE192BFA0195DFF50FD9A78BB24
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0xBA524C6408A6652F8D530CA5FDC4C2EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it

is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0x601E2B6B213E9F392E5EC9E1996DCA28
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0xD6E39F8C7FE1C39D75803080DBE48AAC
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x693AA0D58104263235930C809BEFCB0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0x6F5948D6A40D0C8865048C02D5083DF1
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0xD152E397AB6954A042E08273CE4B6246
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x02436A8EA74A040C03D2B5353CCFC914
Lowood."
0xDBA46FE4CFFC5BD8CF16C2C943AF0BC6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x755F1490A60096EF60648FFA08BBAC19
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x7684A120F84F82154D6B3F831926C68A
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0xBAAE295BD88E6B9AFCAF7D667F4FE70A
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0x93737FFC4A51345F073223B0B1A8CC14
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xCF80B2C400C965FB2B4658884A88ACE0
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xD74EAB6D533F08D85D7AF809F77884F3
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x33A7237BA3033C69554A99BF9AD11A07
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x8B626D0415CF5E49E0AB648497342C1E
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0xD00BDC2C2E506EF0D06B27F435932B37
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0x1DC41AA2E879A7BACA9BD0129AF6FFA3
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x0C0607698A82720739ED1FDF279B1058
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x8C24F49F246545C58456C0F89F492E4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0xDBF8E5CA2AA8142E9E3B56C8FE1CC42F
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0x00EB88E2C27D5E5218D183B1436304AC
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x088C06E49AFAFE3CBF2B3580D18997F2
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x812E94B9A5347892DAABB5E2B74CB127

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x1789BC62DD39266F5CE5581326A5991C
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0xE5938D59BBF405B76CC6F94D5BBF5C31
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x432BA118A358B36F55B413C6C1298547
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0x2A87D5D5131F91A9FE5C8C3A720F4DF6
inhabitants."
0xC2A97EDB498B19874FBBD02B459E6CA9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0xFCA71EC7A6D56B7F79FB9C15C302541A
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0xE474B3A62AA92289D2324AF7B10056E1
and prospects?"
0x82996713C10F1A365A4A8A3411EC57B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x8089F2C195E156F013B26F8FA74D7F1E
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0xB62542167C4E425454888BB38AB4DDAF
of her election."
0x941BF2D31F8617A2D79D355B854C32A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x656A6E96B24654C5C218D13FC4C3D050
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0x91DE57548E993987F320A2591406268D
becoming too irksome."
0xAF5FEE79EC1D775D55DAAAE308960C6E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0x43D344D24BDCE6AAA04A8E04EE3440BD
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x6D1DC3CC8E9E45C6B2F3F7A1BE08598F
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x4CE83EC29F909E880C4B4D083828A10A
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0xE3B336191EB9BCE58AD3A15C00C78BDE
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0xBBCB007097E58041EE888E9576F40E0C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x8E30DF0A203260038C65053E94F3FA41
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x0211749E83A10056725410DD1D5B10EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0x5DB2FB293C349EBE3E72F886DD16A557
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x0E9B5EC6F53F49EBC38C8C6F97723BAC
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x6FD58708D0853E1DA8B8DCE1CCFF3957
falsehood and deceit.'"
0xCC5221DF15E90CFC8B7C13A83BE8759D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x348B2681C1B0888456F20C7238B93FCC
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xCB7A76562CBE62106D180985043352A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x7DF054B153DED4D1A5BD0A1A00B52364
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x204235231BCF456F198276DD0C1710B5
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0x6299DABCB48DA92E7FBAB2E5B5334943
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xAE669BE5BFBDBC4E074BCDC704A9E99A
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0xBE5DE591F934D1C73CDB313467A6709D
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0xD628B42BF4E00B8E381BCD64301CD034
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0x6EA577E0354742B3FA5A182EBE346605
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0xF1A1CFDD2229C4CFD19E68785DE63D95
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x9A74854910C46136346506B00BF1DB7A
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x5BC9F3E8A9F888D409794B2D29840190
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x04E2FBE9430B822090E2BCB8D56267D4
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x518891A69FB3D93EA993544EE3734AEE
handsome attire.
0x076A311CDF574B1F8DF1E9952BD15AA3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0x9525F9A0E4183CF5DDAB65F0F39F23C0
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x4841695DDD7B075EFDC2DEBB635322DB
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x7BF2002B5C4F3DDBAF80FB56ED9FE993
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x9B7FD03A3FBF1CD65F09E072AC09DA1B
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x693231EB2685470D429333A766CBEA7C
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x92EE4BBAEA8C72157F24D91B1A60536D
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x9FE5BFF95EFE0C2ABD885818A9574EDB
fomented now within me.
0xB6D717AFB4D7DFF35BBCD9284A4BF6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x397E4EA049994560F84A96BD67B3B833
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x8310B65182AD3982DB40845A6F6E3944

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x66D2AC50A54E0BCA5EE486F8081A37AA
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x3AE7D7B5CE70AEE226546B4E8DA82E7B
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x4B08A13437DA5F6CA8509616FD4E1E37
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0xE64F77AB72C081208083C7E9AC2E731D
to her.
0x47620172FCE85C8CC75FF513F46B53E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x2AD0C1FF06D3907FB82B99FB74A25DFE
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x11B714E2003E70E77231D895CA816E60
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0xBE5B6030D250F394D2C58FEB4FFFA454

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0xA58C4CF94AFE9F08EBD1F166E52217C1
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0xE0AEBC7635055B6EA7FB46F3D3C82A76
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x9B111C1ACC92DE29B3B66DC16037B060
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x5F5AC373217210F86A20965587E6C5BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x99FAF2552176D2D2296340C49A7F0A4B
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x32B3864819C15A1DBAABEB93A2F950A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0x8EE7533D7FE4B39B548D28A7D6190848
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0xE89D94A03FDD6BD5186C731B6858442F
used to a child.
0xBACE84CFDD05166A5703E65856BF6596

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x4DA5FF7FD89AA4C18EFEB4A6D3BB2A0A
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x35915FD4AD8DF53A883C695F3BB5B069

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x8E8C1ADF55FF880D3DA96541D251D6C6
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0x093CD2FA71563052DBFCA7CB23293C69
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x8DEA2C93A1657962FC866E48E7D1968D
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0x16D07BD7BA340F80C15FFA03D5E863E1
miserable cruelty."
0x3EB84FF6DF2194AC642BBA6E581329C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x622DC7F0403D006AE2AFD6A86F2DCEB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0xD034348490561724568D3EF9FE0169F7
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0x7534F1B0396A5C06326699EA985CD490
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x03ABDE912D1671582A91BC4E5600C48C
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xAFF96E64C0EF091078810D01B3F7CBD9
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x13C04BA0654E9EA13D7E4B0BAD1FFA68
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0x92D079B6DFDA9E3E6A21FD08FB2CB820
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x5FEA33DD0C6CE51A4D3BD147CE119EB1
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0x008C17D65692BC3B650AA43DFD5E6B68
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x89D1C4F98C30FDC91CCCBDD7E3C1060A
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0xA13E8364E9FE2978FDF6A765851401E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xB5DF45238EF364EDE862F35C2E9A4BB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0x5837A030F65B6CB0400B17CC23BF69C0
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x203CA2F9BE7EA0E02EC9B27C6C161CDB
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0xEAFCB599EB58141A15C204CAF41A4097
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x094AD1DE49E334193EFBC404BEEBD23D
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x9E0E7A7FC84868C330AB04B73393819F
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x3CCABD3E7B38E6C7F3E7A96CC221DA37
would cry.
0x86D994071189132F9FADAC0A6DA3FAEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x15FC2B724EDF8183EF430252ED693F32
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x3B500B977CD7A30DFEE273B0EAC4E823

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0xBADFEE29826A8D251FBFB6F331C8B51E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x2B1C1A924C488A45F1504C16B8303C94
your friend."
0xC59888430EC51455B75C95C2923718C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xAE11B06A93C18940D793BC78C7B2FA98
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0x5802834D0DFF2596A7ED6B542EE78C48
you have done."
0x48098ED3D8ED68E99D22F04FF8679A95

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x2A60032CC317465DE318672E7C098FF1
their faults."
0x2881BD591274312073BCF91E73869851

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x5AB45E490AB9A999D12F1516DDA636BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x25A85DFAD8722232E2214FB82F221BDD
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xAC192414B75168951EF1DE0DC7C48358

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x605302704AFFFFEB167464CDB612D0B7
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xD1238D350F12E647453019FF8F1BB090

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x136E63D0C8CD39841F2FEF2E5110B173
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x6FDC477B5407A7C5EB31EBE5F74EF7C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x76EAD760FD4E7FF379B62B351D046D1D
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xACC8EADA11863C28DA3A6F6E3AA3D72E
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x72B3AE685B937BE62D5D04FC53825FA7
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x4164DC908467F04F1B0CACFE49EF0263
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x5B0B8B5E98322F0CB164687C43B0075E
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0x27EAA6DF42ADD820CB5415E5AFEE91A6
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0xBEE66A5D210FFA4C4BFEDB6B1FCA5260
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0x264C081DA1EC353B97AFF1ED0E00EAE4
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0xBD2C274BD7C6FAB7F9FE82B8F7EAAD7A
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x9680279B018A119EFD7DFD3471C5DE0D
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x3A2E4ADC651B5E23D95BD7609DF9A073
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0xC041AB9D709118A3BD2BDC0621598090
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x851CECD4E9785CE835C1F520FCEFE5B4
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x2B26ACE72DD1981B29F6D419666A6568

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x28E793A74FF5F4F5C94F1968418DAFF3
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xFE3296A256120FFB80934BBC424E90CD
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x4354675EC772B4A327F51ECCC95EE0A4
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x0DE7D01AB5B2294ACDBB3D994DCC1739
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x501873322C77B5EEBBAE5996389F1CF0
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0xBC8DA197405EB71CE97648DA5C5D9A09
of my nature.
0x1B2FAE11776E2FA4B96F5EABB99693AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x7A65AD30080B022A10FC0F899FCAA3E2
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0xFB717284601EE9B010717D08E9B7D504
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x73B752BE2B7E9C039E34C628796539C9
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x151CD52CA0E98D5C61F73D2086276CE8
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x08A967D66EB8FBC6C038A04C8C9514E7
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0xE46F040082C0C9B478530386B1AEE397
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x4B8803E0B2C5E135812DB5C99A6239D8
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xFC4EBC88CA0F7D0DB7B96D492ACECB04
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0xF13F9B436D52B9A928F770EC0FD32BC4
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0xB7C872AF73DAD75F9B85FEB513307A82
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x209B6D4150FAC00CC0CCA3C193FE88E0
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xA61C9CDA02F787AAF00D69A9B5941A34
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0xE2CE503EABCAF896775A4A8F91B83A8F
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x765663EA59C3A28E7D258AC82543CCAE
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0x8E9247757D5BD2D0BC57894EB937A8B4
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0xD540CC25FE1D2D233E25B86989658CCB
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x9D235C0C9FC1F555E8015BB361EC4734
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0xA95A64C47206560D043F84314A7A0E3B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0x18DDD21B0026C195DDBFF4593A890CF0
to lunch!"
0x408D043C1B11B98496D4AE7F247A1619

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xDB27C85E91C4A122ED33AB443C150966
came tripping down the path.
0xDBFE005D3F0862F9D2F94703197B7B12

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x885F2311F978DA4DD92972E2F2DA45FF
called?"
0xAB6F0F8CA4D98970B2BCD737AC747013

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0x79ABDC366748EF49A86750679C88B80E
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x41F1CC92CEBBD0186398E26D575DDF1F
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xFFD54EFABEB3576CBFDC91EE3193B40D
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x97100A74CA71E2CD8AEF47DB7F610B17
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x8F100F05B215B043FB8A6B5865272FAE
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x009AF6F0988758B6BF3B4F9A37AA0EF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x77683FB246087E2E1B3BF4F78E2F9E15
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xE1D022AF32891C435FCC0BA969D3C5B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x455B11E1D00B3EFD2FA09D59C7D59698
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x5CE59F98C9869DF96E7003FBA15E8864
suppose?"
0x01BBF4A9E87DAFEC05696B4E69A84B7C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I nodded.
0x75F7C18F44B8548AE477FB2260ED688D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x0A941645DFC3BB71B598EF69289C3300

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x197523263B26605D73875CFFB77C0984

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xA9F2DF9931CDE1FE8324534B7A4418DA
be bolder."
0xA8EA90A054BEECCF6C2CE1ADBE2629CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x281F94B6F9F86305B3F8782607F537F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x9EB224D27F2E21C423BBD902AD8DE8F3
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x1585F2D37B98C10FD61FFC7E615759D3
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x37711C62039AF3FFF6FA90B7F1464BC2
for you."
0x789CD5D6CE73A16F0DC44DC16C42666C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x1FFC20B1E04AD40E34B236FFE3F187C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x64F68FEAB1242B351142D337E3D39BF1
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x66E9F269C2C9BE1072B6BA2781F7F4AF
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xB1BFEC0E8C2230002BDFAC1D018CFB19
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0x7F1AAA18C002BBA9F97AD4878DE3F818
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0x2D64A6EFB46863A43E0432C4A4BB56BF
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x33340BD7308CFCB3F18CDFD2B1C07720

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x44B22EDFC76FFBC42E766C8917185600

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0xC8DE2F499DAEC4F70D31EDFA2B04E56F
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0x99648733747C02A5827DF7D467246D07
provoking."
0x53B569A8B2FF0BAA6CC39E7020CB7D68

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x39C386EE6995174B414A5FC175AFBA50
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0xA11D883B653AD934BFD3CF53387C65B7
dread."
0xBD0C43981C650BD2C89DA9AC6B2CF24C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x96BB72485C48D9506FA5106D44C7FB55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x4EF5990506B723D48D52FB901B7598F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x3FBE7675AD7EECE90BB5D8A77A41F1EF
others."
0x54444D91FA75DDD924136AE3D9B854D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You don't show it."
0xA870C298D58E85A14880E723141892A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xBCEE0EF1509EE7AAC5E98B5D1B603A6E
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0xFA7DFEA08A69F06B96D74FA5681572EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x31A3F3A8D98453110458C87C9D269DC9
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x374A4D242B78D9296C9C2C6572CB1C10
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x5FB9397BA4CFAB46E994D71A49632624

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x0E7C62FE6C2E69DEC57ABBD36AF42AA3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0xE7321FF507721F0890D2C8D1B5F5A2F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0xF0FF6EBF6D0121D67B4622B43425CFCE
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x87340BB7A4FDFBE83E1F953DA9803745
you'd _rather_ not."
0x047574DA66AB302BA671C23336072C42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0xD5485AD40D9EBB06B7E700B10D884393
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0xCAEE35FDEA4411A8DD12D2DEF48B9A73
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0x3690693B8154511776C5FF4BA14C3420
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0xD009B4EC32C56FF6B1AC140A33ED14EB
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
0xD43F84C02B24CB2E522E6850E5D11069

CHAPTER V
0x9109C6F17EB674C56F12B19E75ACE144

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0xA44A41FD985331DCD4FA36CBED6DC7AC
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0x2E612036AA3726F5D9607BE000EFC5E5
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0xA9A9F063C9D6C2CF5A61A6B30FD93726
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x9398388D91C1B312E6E82EA58B9B1993
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0x5258A4C054843E890236B1A1FB430155
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x132ED045F398C36C8EE8274CA4F8C146
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x11582AE8C8862A13F8163F26546257FC
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x1CDECA4224AAECC9C3ECC4680355197C
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xAC44385D976FE560E4D98375554C8A0A
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xAB8AA4537A95ABABE5FE71B8CEBD3414
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xFE107B7A4AD816C47F32934E36A29A43
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x55BEBA2628EDA0083E93459E91F4E3CE
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xE43AC0789540041D8A5801A9A05AC42F
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x813F911F22B12B09D41D7B359C5BA7D1
bye?"
0xA7998A83D756E19A18FFB84A4A41C330

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0xF016AD05C52794D02CBF39A0A90A428B
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0xEDAB05F7A81010DF60CC31F9CAD11502
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x0271D30E4431272EE428CB978F143EEF
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x07D41D4960816CAF83E19AAE18CB51F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x435C4FEEE348D88F6ADBA206A305D0E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0x65F7CCF0134A4CED96349C26670B0B3A
the wall."
0x9CBDB0C55B18209283FC4D1D55E59911

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x4D8DE67FC8C19A41996DB7ED7CBB0A91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x07ABFEFC33A3971DAE0C564CA199E781
been my foe."
0x611F8BE719F44BD8F3B4017079120D7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0x004D4E57E4D5FA0B32916B003FD64A1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0x25C4E708B0BEB49142D29F1ABC29EFE6
out at the front door.
0xF9EB32EC4697A7746A44A1B0F494D951

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0x24A5441ABA6F082758B1D5BB328E9EC2
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x445C2DD81EF80B14E331DD7440E1E6F5
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0xF42DAFB6921F4181D994E11209B12466
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x14892D3E3E44D19E0C1E696A18F566A9
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0xC79E8F43863252F7EFB65E8144328E38
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x3F3127A1E15E23A6B80453DB9F9CAECE
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xCD7852246E4FB7D1FDAC49AAD33E03B5
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xD3BE035B6E9048A0C0E01BCFDE9A85CA
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x3601AFA7D07224FDBB6A4FBEEC5DA441

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x782D529E4C8E3A9F6D452D081A8DDFFE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And how far is it?"
0x19B9011351CF252790DEAF827FEE58D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fifty miles."
0x5A53609F6A4FA86EFBC99927F205FA7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0xB2C862056E317E1C029E60DB6947BE20
alone."
0x4BAEB35C35E96E6E159CA81C368F1786

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0x1C0DBF5EA159CDF785D0FA3B7346E530
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x5C576BDD35D578CEC3B4E5510467EBD7
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x5AF8E88F6D34E9AAAC283EE8EE4E07D5
with kisses.
0x7B428796A055E7B058D7087E403D0554

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x8C11AE1A5CD109F0F5EA466E0D038418
me into the inside.
0x545216697395B4883C8E010CC2035C98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xFB27B5C8F71A55A63F105821F33558A2
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xCF8EAF91CE5A00A8DD3E6A282641D365
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x6383AF3AE390272D813D07F5AEC8E3E4
mysterious regions.
0x69907555813A858952E9A0AEB1978B51

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x9C9BD72542D82A668CC7949E8ABAB187
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0xBF8DE84D4D0B0BE11A360AB7FECFF19B
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x87077DD53AE3457963BB67FEBEF9CBB8
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0xF2E38BCE4B5391D63F0B9E596F415035
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0xF3E647ED8768A127CB4E27830AE2F41B
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x4C2DA91BC135CF154D9FC66445831AB4
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0x551B5703CF9D54E78206B86EAD234DB1
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x9D44EEEE601F50E1408A0AABB7802E2D
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0xAE54F702067E14671E927E5A2BA27FB3
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0x1D4F673BBF535DDADA20FBFD5E252FF3
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x34ACCE48D57939B7974B5BDA89D0061F
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0x460DDE24F4724CB48E66E99ED6A50992
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x88C6CDA6C44899488D4E0360EDBE5715
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0x894D9F7E38BBC1918F85D1CAE4D0C90D
"stony street" of L-.
0xA383B1278AE83CB63822730EA46AF497

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x689977B11AC4B1F7320BA312BA48885B
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0x16E113A5E30175A34D7669A92C91A37D
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0xC85D140DEE1A589FB263FD9815244068
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x4D65E7052B7A4553D04F91DE6CB3925B
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x010CF67703DA6B814B0DAD9B8668FA84
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x83D99F8C2DC96AE4BDEB3189702AECB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x615435D0A179586BA23C0D238B8E6EC1
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x892567A339514ECCA0D065F6AD5D6375
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x09B020971412278070A8363C5DD4A01D
by the light of the lamps.
0x48AC9DFD5BCDDE0FC1CB2034E909BB8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0xF65B28ECB28ED62F77F9EAF43483EB69
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x32D40027D214740584AF4DEC81754A1A
instantly drove away.
0x51702CC20DA8FD6171436240B299123A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x11F7555C0ACF332FDC268681BCC1C71E
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x7C28A2DD751F341E8B5A7244F7D775D6
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x88C44FB3BD34CE31DD0786B941633AD5
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x00581BDC5926EADBCE210BBBF2A0769E
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x748401FF7BA0DF4D8338FC64BE6969C7
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x205AAADC1675F0E181A1F9D6A1D91A37
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0x65AADCB516EB13A3244AD498CE8F6649
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x9D289E189056EC7BA377EDB9C45A8311
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x6608418BA8BBEB696357F750AC5E4E52

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x6BD8DD780C6CD273EFDE929C729343B9
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0x777BB4C62DE6D56A43942D5C34ADD27E
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x155D0255F1B5BD7E4DF04E19FA6C7142
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0xE17C18BF4676D38AB2400BDD0E709BBE
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0xE979E0D42A6473E172D775E8B92BD21E
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x505D2D89825875B45C25E6F792EB177C
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0xCC3976439ABD14CB2557D3027123C78B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0x54E5C102AE830ED9BAA9C90AFD006244
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x8D44455F05ECF9F68E1D99C83F93D683
grave, her bearing erect.
0x0861A5DF9E1FA457E7B375C37683BD38

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x94C29DD77EBCC6B0FFADAF7EBC9B7544
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0xE739CB7632B61090E41B404203EEDD9C
then further added--
0x6F81B59D8485B13A1AAA4036E266077E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0xBCC10E3C05760A1832F9F685BCFB884B
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0xD5E83466AFD07079017A9ED6773EE13E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A little, ma'am."
0x38D5C863C30E2D7971F34A71279F838B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x9110545D75E47B6E3C655AB0E303D612
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x1CC0E1AE4E6C40FB5A99A1DC3DD7DA60
come to school, my little girl?"
0x44A05C4B26BD42F63238428D40F56A38

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x471E8FC05B57A99C0A8B7AB7E570EFD9
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0xAE140C500C8D67C481002A890F7A99F1
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0xAD666EC4267EA99B9A28AE87E52264FC
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0xD4F6D3764A2989FA99A40DD2BD7C2961
me along with Miss Miller.
0xD49232835B6876AACCD7F4C9A99A9015

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0xD8AEA3B918FDACC24FC171843125235A
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x5151DF39D9D8331C3A0D4BE90FC42BF0
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x0FC8220D603D65233BA917749663435D
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0x8BDBF91CC5C9C0A3814721BE1F16ED55
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x2A87A81DC5A12FE2BFE15782DE30A39C
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0xD21C831ED5D7884B2CBA4780AC7F184C
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x612C2F539D7EE3A01D773EA615553340
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0xCEEF4ED01E11C85847914B464CBB1E4E
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0xF94E119107F1DA8EEBF30F344C8461FA
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x2E0597F49E099BBB5DD9BB0A6E331713
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0xA08A630EABD323E88282231535933CD8
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x6982435A3E079A5F50CF5613DB1A3FB1
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0xB0C1766577E3883734577C5AE0153404
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x779CD1F1D19CAC513A91B598AA28C2E4
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x152713C0EB523705A2F7C914905E87C5
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0xFBD39B7F034A153C0D034F9B6719AD77
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x8A5ED78974EB8FC2C08FDF64B458F8FC
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x00A445C5CD6287FF4A03C298FF88B30B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x9CDEC376729E4CCFEBE32024C191B51D
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x531853154A8C569B06705B1E27C4368F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xCEAA87840D57D571B97E586AE871E19B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0x3176CA01CC2A119DB20CBF491DE208EA
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x9B4DDF4F26A3A2640D2F2DFACBAA9352

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x5C40CC822D16F10762D11A0BD1C3045C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0xE25E1E37415085A85F4D79F2301E1D85
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0xA9AD08747FA1FCAA112EBA3B4FE1AFD7
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0x9DF733D7C2449A53FDD7F271E6D71B76
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x9946F0FAF3B3960892510240D6BA18F5
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x38DF9CF51A5B6E526D989BE036AEE2B7
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x6C3858BBE9E2FF478095842652C29BEB
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x9DC7D0B919D33B7F95A7ABD7D170C83A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x63A7908923EB2C21521E16DDB1E814E8
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0x884ACA59ABFDB5D5478FCEEA9091B39A
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x39723C9E400D988422506DE825CFB04C
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x2DA3EECF42247C816611ACDC4FCF83B2
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0xB5010480929624738DB94F1B6C8EE606
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0x208484A229246008A8109E991D7133B4
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x2C56FD60C643CC6BF8B2F6D4FA01BF85
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0xA963DA003D61E6B3884D15D8D51815DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x85D57FCA7C5A78A3589FE5F3142C21B5
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x798378F75833DA12DE3791AF3273FF60
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0xE7724097D3989503C6C3359361853AA2
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0xEA8673DB53E0120776172A271550EADE
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x187F4C8FC2758D833C4633DB343E91D8
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0xA3D890D062F62F2A1D12FB851DA632EA
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x5EC975BC97DF3B54985F43EED2A94541
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x0A5E9374F367A30CB28B63FF99C0617B
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x927AF0E62C96745BB8B13979874CD1E7
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x854BA36831691F0FFE5FA9C4924D5AE2
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x036E3F9151E42FAE7D799F7C5F46E5D8
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x8A71610779A124B8D3316931A97961A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Form classes!"
0xB996C5D664F2B119EBE52F316BA841D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x96619344090783FBAE14C6F969CBC5C3
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x21085CBDF1937A12906A1EF8829AFEDA
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x8AB66B246A78727CF07523CA30AD2BFD
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0x9F78BA36FB7C98778B682AAB843CDAA0
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x13210DD1355E5B246C4F59C52DD8BFB5
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xA74D7FB2F1871714A23C0E109EED86BD
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x474B784BC9170E5904E23E70F4EF495E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x784ADCBB5F674073F214C8BEEA9E9F1E
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0xF72AE09CFD4E746CF6CB53EB7951A304
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x929B2857F2B9D04D0F064940D1EB176E
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xE99099BCDBD4BE81B1FADDC932F5554E
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x657221BC8F62F6C3D5D6FD9957825AE7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x17ADE779875E59EDB8DE4E673A8C660F
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x43EC409153F2E751B4AEECD222D32BE2
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0xDF9D5F00EED89CDF3823995E71C7E45A
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x3442331ECE16C8461AB379E287F4E5EF
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0xC4482E6AB2DBD9601EB3E5C4652F834A
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0x1B6FFEF3B0F9F1FD89CD52BD9B035AA2
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0xCC308E36BE5BE1779D3791A26B49EBCA
little the day before.
0xEACDC4FFCDF37F1DA043A0C40ACBE4A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x14CBFA05F927B7E08260E452B9D921D4
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x8BDEA333C7D45F3CFC3456EEB11EAF15
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xE19CA31734390FF3EF481C7FDD1341B9
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x92F090FC24B090D75A6F6B2EC9285505
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x270C276EE554EC18B42CFE43360BB6CB
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0xAAF2BBE3402E09C275ADADFE7CE6B73B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x70F98AE31C686E6A3CB0F37D84BF715E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x114FB6ABC7E8113C6C1F11A760CC7B7E
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x8F0D2A609F00F53A861FB29A09BFFB48
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xA04E81C508268185E4BD145A46EB35C1
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0xEFA896B1A779C591D58A189453987DBF
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x8CD605986D586F9C4B46ABADDF36DC89
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x1DEFD1A30FBA5F28B30225150D6BE4F2
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0xB32F3DB5E5C062F6FEF084E753217B5D
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x945B545A564D972618C2F5BF1D4D0334
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x30503C1E825DD5FE0D380908B577A718
the meal began.
0xF9E51C42056F49147952D583B99DAF04

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xAF8E489AE54A44BF58D2539E02372A63
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x1462E807E2114CFE92CAB3A5D6135143
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0xBE7C8B6AED467064806FC90C2BE949A5
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0xD4DA747C158F7F3D52B35173B4AA7C74
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xC6A18EF6CD415243AC63E1B68756488B
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x8A23E3A794694D667F567B78C1238B36
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x410D786172EAE12285E0F1C6BA094EBF
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xB5C2846567384536D772AE33CA4AF365
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0x83307DFA16CDB54296FDDA67C18C8261
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x26F08FAAD78066B51DA523B135B2A496
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x8C2A80F3DF849488BA0CFAF18D0AFDA7
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x5AD9A73FC9DFE759E1576A53A14D85B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x743A0D952D64F45103D70ABCE09A419C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x5774CDB84CD4528BEE9B29A48A84F085
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x05AA48BF7ED001BDE6A3C3ADDB9FE4EE
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xB42496133420B09CD8BC63E4FBABEE95
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x845CB18EB941D2F2ADB8A3174482927C
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x8785E8F2EC6C828FADB1D4823504ED34
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x42D09D489F64EB5AC5302FBC65EC9AA1
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xA4AD16515EFCCDC6CB4259B035C49196
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x0D69F8A2BC2645C3EEFF55D1ADA06280
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x5039DBFE1DD19EAAB4B844290DD4D609
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0xEC26C46E123F8554B8639426EB69F6BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0xA92B2DB391484BC7CC71FD3A5CA965E5
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x29A9FB4186540213CBA9E492EBE154ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0xDFDDE4F93302E2B7C00ECDB6B2C49F77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0x24A0915F634A4036F8C60B7DB05FFEE4
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x1C2C51089B0A7FDAFC8B99AE93DB6838
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0xED43D0C4C1F826E3A131CB1147011559
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x8C4A816893DC27EA6A24E88584BD2CBA
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0xE5369DFE7D8583241939B9624F518F89
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x83A8D671640280B458A1C272F92464DD
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0x0BF3FD83F5255B674130C8B54E9EC798
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x3B14C2712EE7C1A96F3BD51121B73575
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x18CD61F4D7E161FFA220570FAD7E3B91
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0xE2C702E00EFCDB7C2B4B49B281EB3002
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x00ACE512FD0128036346897EDA0D2A58
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0x3A15A92F64B1251830B906F268D13024
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0xB5EBC174DD4DAE60A13454550E997BD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0xED53D702CE6B2A84BC0B64EEACFE4C4D
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x11636F41010619ED663438DADD482BDD
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x64F3EDAA80A235CD0E6A035BE034A2E0
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0x4A6AF9B893A9988A78836A183047E796
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x3802FF43F3A0E08B599983F61441218E
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x4C5A0A3BC6B4EE837897E3E16A3FFD0C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x6F0943F9502E0A135D0A12F1EF9EE6C7
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x5AC58DAAEDB77BF4F2F9256666C160DD
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x2794D62A3A370CE5EFC4E983B8B72B39
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x1C291F505E17C05CF97A443869A5877A
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0xEF85470060E6D54972D3C81D3A52D72E
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0xB5F569BE415A16586A4683E5BF7FCBD8
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x2FB2B840B353ACEEEE6F8FE680186391
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0xE191F4BC69EB488F7FC424C51C36338B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x0B299298FE97C65D2D758DCED3C87672

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x3A8415B0207BF0B74A955F0A9CBC52A0
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0x35ED0220696437D8DDDF60633F4B2DF6
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x147EE4AFB09370F53D0C36E0F2607B4D
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xB6E86299D5440EBEF8562C020E5FC040
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0xE3925E890722A9638EC2C1E6375E070C
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0xE185E7D548D4ACF7159951FE0523ADFC
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x1488A6000E5EA1CE552A7ED840DB8CCD
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x5462B3969A632872DE9E699C2A91DF21
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xC0FC24B6A16A9FFC796C166F37E25FFE
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x202235FEE7C9E1681D62C2A503ED83E8
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x21D9B442A7BEDECED1F27323D8E4860A
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xE608417FCC2F0C63311A0CC8214E1DAA
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0x047B3630D9A212AFB004B7CBC3C0A9FE
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0xB5ECA2CB983234CA92BB788F04059884
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x5E38907AB795909D52BF674D5C9CC04A
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x79C69B3F6710DF0A3B448937B1121E8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0x3A406A1DED148F88A54BBD4B905DFFA3
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x9B46850E04116DAF6A0663409E4CC35D
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0xB18C183B3A0E784054D1CD70226C1BE9
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x7D5F6C50E00947988F9FCD31A3FE2C4F
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x21EB40B578EFC28DA1AF9366465FC2CD
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x395A9D1656F72E11F77B1AC553C8FD4B
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0x7F092581BA7F89FD873E5982896CFA24
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0x05BA2085401CADC931758C493DE9FE90

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xEC29BAB21DF9FFA42B66EEC86594D8C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x5B39E6DC970AB1E8AFF5BC9EC40288CE
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x6453B465807FE13F4C8EB0C10E04176E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x886D6A78714CF6098680317AB7F311CD
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0xB454FAC0B378E46788A80D1121638E10
to all."
0x1F5D2EC822AB678F218BEF6A188BD4CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0xE7BAF2931D6F68F9A3629EECD1A73473

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x871C3821348944B6BA7188A3A70C8174
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0x9E9F3076B58BA7F234F978B305C21244

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x1C6BFD0D518AD97F10270CC2BEF3DDB6
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x0A9BE4168D150B72D8A506C8D081D58A
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0xB526781925B4169C59F9353D190D2A22
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0xFEE438827CCC018F5E50740F81AD288B
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x8D2BE9C6360FF4505A1A2B93F15973BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0xEA1CEF3E6D204B4D1676D38D78BB4946
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0xC07C0F229A7F3F24002841E4D95337A2
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x01A0413C2C543AEF87062D01748A1A30
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0xD932FF09C0CCF662ED9EE9FE85489C2E
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xF6ED06FA6E766DD304F1DE197955944F
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x24D201B1FC5A5971609FD3B0CCD52BE0
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xFEFE094E91B092DC7707515200759A5C
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x99F87DAC7D556D23EFED10AAEC5ACEEE
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xAD84B51CB148D80AAD11027B697D1A98
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x46CD94BA53267397E7E3F9874C17B461
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0x4F2F6CF7B598239056CCBEC06404833E
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0xBEE752EA71B8DD93D43E15374870D6EB
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x9EC32E29448A518355E306881FC2DBCF
hollow cough.
0xADF9582E8810F63C2451DA0A647260EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x83D33B2676126E99A6DDB12F0FEAC2EA
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xCC71784DCF3116F24C6421420682B23A
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x516EC257DC0581953AD6B1FCA102B232
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xF044477A2EB1F47ACCA6CE0B97659E52
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xF4326BEEF6BDDF9239C7B0E1823653D9
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0x61CAAA985706269B155F8CF25B420840
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x6B148AF57920FC8CDFDD9707FEFC0CEF
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0xBA2078034B505BCC91719F5725A43CB9
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x12A90B65CC07196D3D55E42E14868D4E
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x1337E1EF0186B43F42506A225E4C4B6A
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x2B7FFFF6A56A772924C1AA5704F0A1B4
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x6C7251D1A81D43DE217E086E9A324DA2
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0x77FA0BE44A20EA5319EADB0AAAE9AA8F
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xEEDCFF40904CD4DC6D6288731A816B1C
this inscription:--
0x9EFB2F72DE478A2AD70427519BEE2FE7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0x3E783D5DFEE05276B7B0B011F42BCA12
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x503FD1778ED09F7E96AFBE8A6777E735
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0xBD62976D72068B4263D755733C773383
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0x355F7DAA5B4F2307BD1900BB8BEAF726

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x2B13CCE27255AA0EB0FFD95FD45AC619
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0xD4A71B413B41F52C9365B61F1705573A
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x2FE5A070DE15BC96FE9042F6C6E0DC48
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xD3B14094228ED01EFB07D64B043FBE55
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x7E385812DC153D4C1472326DD0880B25
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x2897351CAAAEA6585786ABA64E743A19
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0xFE2C96F277006CBD7CB414719C339128
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xC7E62CC78E1287748C89D1C3A5674D02
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x8DB5DB22F0CF56A7508DFBC133BE1786
I said to her directly--
0x855AAF6D919CBC120FFED67EC9271249

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x1D7CCF2E123D1D1E7EA85073C4931FDB
her to lend it to me some day.
0xF5E90D85C60AB39A3F39DEB43BD8422C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x9474C674970A1D78D7E5A6130803BAC2
she examined me.
0x6DB6E7BA1C560CA3E0B66AFE65E041BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x0F5D0E58FC6C475BB053A01CD4C5BDD5
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x894FC65915EE7A7F42EF33D7FF87177B
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x3E75EF0DF512531093EDC4578DD4F17F
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0xF99A1B5872DAD3FD2CC992EC357D3F86
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x93ACD644B9986BFF6EF7BE4A21EEEF3E
or substantial.
0x26A96B9DB287C95BBE9B884AF134F2DB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0xC3CDA7B57600773B9887EAEBDB5FF34D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xE8839294531D2B07F8201E2F7D5C0A2A
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x57C64B12208527620A2D824E5E8AAA17
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x47BB9C43DB46130DD0B01731D5E3ED87
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x821174B08ACEAA6F9035352EF07B6104
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x6F3F43E35C45C18843898F434705C59B
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xAD381D0788E05F05B1CF1A97E7DC9F50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xADA00517415044F9757092FBDBE6366F
is Lowood Institution?"
0xA581A3DD0C2F240F2682AD659C9230BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This house where you are come to live."
0xF5FA946154875A19496528446EBA61C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0xE15EFD6910E999BDF4BD036FCD84AA47
other schools?"
0x70C56622C01A6D13249D932AB103DF39

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x4907D4191770C373902E700A204E152A
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your

father or your mother dead?"
0x4E5C65389732C72C83316EA316D651A8

is called an institution for educating orphans."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the

deficiency is supplied by subscription."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and

who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,

and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
0x252BAFECCAC3CAA55FACA7D59B7EB46D
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
0x99B462EBCDF69E272B1210A9AE4C19D7
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
0xDC2BEEE235B2F03441A57466FA8A7CA2
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
0xC3D86AA8A16DB30BB28409307F4A21AC
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
0x07EEE7A9EBA82B52CC29948D5050367B
teaches French."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

she knows far more than they do."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Two years."

"My mother is dead."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you happy here?"
0x423C4DB31B61FB9175AEB0720E1EAB63

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
0x4BCB69C764B7F6C7A0267946922A756C
the present: now I want to read."
0xBD794EE52107AE089389802E40448F51

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xDAEBBF005D2D1345C8FF6EFD884A20E1
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0xFC785D9B334DFCC5EF17F95904504B7A
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xB9972C4FF1639C9ACD7C537D3404CF2E
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0xC3FA3159FFEACC2A9A3A60C074BC0A29
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0xF97E955DC4D2B7C9EE2D43E4BA9671BE
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xBC9941CCFF73D42AF6EF36E831EDF3DE
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x1FD3E6BFC7CAEDB944303E1231CDA829
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x8726CAF6140551C3C66159EA39BBE521
day's fare would be like this.
0x13A57AA7B1CF5DED3B3E464C09E95225

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0xF3EF98E42A7241A47DABEB36A145ED79
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x8B1C3A8135E7513B4ED73D1686021AFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x830BEA4FFDC89EF1D8FBDB9CCA0771D1
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0xBF878C575AA2BF226C79C59ABC673139
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0xE2D148407C97D08DDEC4CF1060B3607A
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x39FDA6DA6E387F775360FDD84658568D
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x89A0DFF0C83384C820F8515043375425
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x32C23F6F73DFBE83DE6BF7FA1758CD2E
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x959A377D8C736FEE46E2DBFBFAF575B2
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x16CE6677AF6FF5AA8AAF9F0211B5E231
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x2552B33E3FD1B603D9F470C7A347BC71
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xFC0BF6EC5CED328D5B20C755EFAA68BE
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x332763A2452680A4A2D657197B02345B
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0xD095DA4A63E9B57ECD826ADA9F630339
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0x6002FEDC4392404409CD6632D887EE08
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0xFE31BF3DB1818BB7296CE656348841E6
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0xD30A6DE02CD5F4F802E447E5C9042FE0
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xF0D771CF75B103F161CECAE0B311B942

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0x005FE966180F5E1CD8AD94223AE933F4
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0x338D4ED71635C15D7C5129D82AED933B
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0x159190D3554F60A88AC7B094FCBDE9F0
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x0C7160ECA3A183729F8EA078B9D37FB6
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0x6641A945370A6D2477A495F43F9F1828
first day at Lowood.

CHAPTER VI
0xE3AF2E9B47E244EA1E2BE9388E1F3078

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0x60C5BBB078F40F6042DA0F6DCD606E9E
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0x31EAA1AE14A7AAAF3DEE8C01321836FB
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xF24912D9EC931DBD516EFE3A257EEA79
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x40CC6A3E8EF2EE0EF2F0BEC61F66A1BE
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x73876EC7DD0C557030EC011B2B1F799F
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0x302480EB1437494B8C4B7F88811B99C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0xAE528366F93884D6299732C0BFEE12A8
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x928C639CF94EE3ECCE8D1D1BB5E9D622
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x4645FF96C7EA069F7E756508AC43CAA0
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x89EBFCFDA4D580ACCC3A1C7642BDFD29

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x8695D22E582D669AF84B6F9171F26B8F
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0x6EB37EC79322DE361E7658D3781D4BAE
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x9762D2468EFAB1013E9E5FA703B8BF4E
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xA05BF348490A3BAF938E419A8EA224C4
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0xF2294CEB93BB0965C30853DC9F086961
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x57DED61A6B97C623730B3BD504A096DA
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0xA769C7507C03D54BC18781189254612E
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x4C3E912D9A745308A166A4B2469BC3B2
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x984A226237AABE806CE757E52BBB961B
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0xD308EA118D1C21EA269FC44540B0C2FA
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x58AA7C871A159D64B38C0F4A55EB361B
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x6A6E66C96883F6EB27EF73C74DF90211
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0x8CD4231C01F5E5289E07E0F971119DEF
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x76F68CCF16C40EAAE05E80EBF78ECB2D
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0xE30761DFC2359E56BDAED24D0E3BF5BD
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x8CFFA16D39C1768AA115E1D662464A92
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0xCAD350BCD1CA3177438B66F2C95D0309
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x32DC74D3E268179EFAFFBAA38947E8D6
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x9EEA14C1038026FBB0BBDC154442C60D
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0xA7B16C5C422160D202ADB3AF23AB3248

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x127D367016AFD0D292A92D4794B4A392
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xA46E8B9E41BF8B352AA241B73143CF05
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x30653747F773273D013E237B9C98BB91
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x32D236DAF44B2F636B90A595197B2F40
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x4D7928FC50AE34525E789EDBE55021B6
&c. &c.
0xF6369AA00CEDCB7F2FFC8358DB9F585F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0xC5C103DCADF0822BD47E9863A1A0F622
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0xF15BB7D80440E3E6ECA2D3243D299E21
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xC30B71988B7C005D3A710CE1E46F6792
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xC1A58213BA1FEC1E3654A28535529665
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x45262C3ED2754CA5F069DDAB36C38FA1
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0x902431C0FC46829DED9BC30B19209042
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xCB3B4AEB1134E0C30D5817D26AFA1DB7
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x9B4551549EC11AF309969F564797272E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x5E3F4E8509329F16B6B6D42D3518EA93
morning!"
0x8D156F8029F429BAB77D0218FF30034E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0xB83EBC8A23C8245E1593988B5C0D9AA5
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x21B8A25701B2433FB1C390D5EE758FCE
as the water was frozen?"
0x58070AA40FD5E0DE9EF5579A0CB8D276

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0xC1E21CDED53BC793B8D6D7245D862455
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x39E7667A8FA547EEA4BEC44AABC164E0
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xC974F0DB8611994493865717D2F3DABD
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0xB509564CC3376D283EC8495824CD928A
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0xC3CFC6D12C7AE98F21A8547D3B7FD5BE
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xF19EB4BB747D5D0CDD9FE0744C845F53
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x7AE84C8172B44EAD6204C7AC9AFBA7BA
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0xFAF456ABBD3047CD28E37616DD025C41
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xEA2FC048DB583D894EC39F43442EF0C1
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xCF904505419935E92CB4E6653F1CB8CE
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0xFD523A2B4F17FE1E498D1FCC259F1E9A
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xAE7C7E054B1BC56F77E10AD92559B5B2
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x945F21246C6FC09A0C8FA00F1AB4BEA4
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x1A0180B7BBC9B30D003A78F75DDCAACB
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0xEF4D5E9B8C66F61237EB4C3E7657246F
altered its ordinary expression.
0xA49BEE176BD1CEC6857EBBAAC7557EC1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x2D58CAD83193D1DB79EF80577E3B0FC5
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x18C59FEEC3A6CA4C47568C6F317E1DB1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x90E206909AEA44EC1EE5008D1B567B4F
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0xA862C3316464E87B09ECFC6E18112348
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x076249D57987E19774A818719971D47C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0x8B5312B38610BFB86560A13A327BD2E5
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xBFFE5FCBE3970751413DDC556FD42846
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x54580505CCA5F0C9C2A6E2D6E9BF2178
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x031636575D9160284473AE6A00C46FD8
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x90D8A8108E857F14DBC6E05FFBF834E3
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x11E0BAFFD51C56CECE580E902072D06C
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x13C4A9215A3D34FA233581D48EB2E5B2
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xAC737BAC94CD298C0B1D4B3A2F9DBBD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x3C803FF59D84C6DDDB60B3866C20C4DA
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x5397BD663F1AF9F635B0032144465354
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0x541C39A638E1D063FB9A8D895510DE55
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x6AC071B958C5356AD9A9389ABDD77E64
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x20378AC2BEBA5B58C7A948441CF6B44A
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x0C6D90064AF3DD49124D6B19EFA50A12
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x7E8AAC04FC15D571B606C22829B1A347

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x317EBAC19ACBAF5E15F008662AFECD77
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x3DD22D077FB375ED0FC8F0A9B83A3F46
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0xB7346F0567685063BF64605675AD90BA
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0xC90E438C8837C2B65A7ED11D7FA03B2C
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x746FE4AB3404038B3A954359A1B88411
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xA65EB6D2AAAF70318705B85E46B9D694
to clamour.
0xE125996F965A224EB64017A986A863C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x0D360A512704E48E0D78C3D66F529C5E
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x225970471A6EC1D410D74C07CE93D110
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x74B1A8118750C7425F63C18C10BFF419
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x3BB7C98D08C6748EF67F830232F15C2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0xB2350B27B9FE5AC02E96649B7ED99F11

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0xDE547BA79F0342CD04736F46402C8D55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0x48B314ADD4E0895556C7291494160390
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0xD46A450F727DAE41FFB412881DE13D5D
floor.
0xF99502949FE2143DA8214FB234BCDF03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0x359679BA37C37E127501748ACC57767C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Helen."
0x9CC5A955810D2DC21FEBE83AD325B38B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x16D39B05B5D8A84EDCDF3E6BF392815B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0xDEACF80137F9E9F2D7932BEC886D46E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you ever go back?"
0xEBD186C1F47298578949ECB98AE1D071

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x524C196CD492930203B0B15897EAFABC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0xB18BE9A251CB13C4B59BB1D0FCA30B50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x4389A096F5EC73D23B3EA11EAE2FF7CF
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x6904CF80CF5DD82D336B10B3CB9C1051

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x3CEF1AFCC1CB29014DC375AC8B6927D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x26CEB0AFF2ECED90650450BB47E9F5BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x356FD23DBB548B50A68F40772AD9F6A4
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x1CA63B11796D9DE845E3E923F0F5CBF5
break it under her nose."
0x13E0690D76E245262806A2F31FF4FB73

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0xB16D04E910AD76E2B5DD081B54ABAFAD
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0xC18F89568ACA625F703EA3D4072AD2C7
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x4736E6689645D972DCF805B58BAB06B1
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x1B8CF059B466D242B1CA5B1C7A21E65F
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0xC4191CEAA5216F32C700297AAED1D63C
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x1DEC8B38EA6A37C1967D2DF004A92771

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xB05DFFB9F3E4C62C1BE99AFF12166A86
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xF71D491E50F6E30A394013062D54A803
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x8B888B6C722857C7391CCBA7E9EDDE5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x15D62F9312C3EC6FCDF1CCA5B9EF2B50
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x0F164B9E88F6502444D92C0B38088DDC
required to bear."
0x8FF58E5BDC53D96F36F82B4AA70D4A8F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xC8AB2DBE6CFE93642C40D244E0BEBE50
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x1984344186BFD71B46B4187310C2F5A6
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0xF5258DEBDC03B84956FC11BAD16338A7
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0xEACFF3383B8530838F3D66E1CC530B82
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x9A1FDA32BD00B6B825662A505EB263D2
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x526E322031FD5ADAF0AE31E57068F8FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0xDFB64D1EC6C9FA2F078B251E439AEEBC
good."
0xD2EB159B3743FA617D9B9E2F7F3EB8AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x4896B6E4D3B935D1920FE62F79ECA049
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x4F841E4BA038E105BAFC50EB67255399
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0x2BEE51F9559F510DC97657B04E7BE291
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x12514167474EA79D6741677B709D42D1
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0xCE7746172E227406462F69EDC4A04B0A
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0xB14243F46C081024A4E643FA1715C8FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0xD7B82281FE749EB8103501BF1075ABD6
addition: she kept silence.
0xA070513ED654B164A4CFA35A35135EBB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0x0D911C46F4C7D371EB3D5CD76BE045B8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0xC00CB9DCC6F19DFB0E758965B4FA77B5
grave face.
0x3A94B1789264FAE2FBC2B595D5344EAF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x62FBBD2BA6E09F76867817C622BCDC9C
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x4F33F178FE7E9786252421D182C1676D
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x7F59C4E34053ABC985F5ADC785354582
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x737399CC25B24B1E09EC0668CE88212E
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure

me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x3F229CF9021A149F8C1BB67470F6CBBA
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."

"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0xA3DE8FBC17B7A4CB81D1C670818ECEFE
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0x957106739ADCF8E2EB9B2A5B0C0E254D
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xB1D0D5C95FFC8402F31CFBEE61A7EC9E
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x427313225A493A5F0296516988F9DCB7
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xB38F2AFFDBC25317C256FC9811DA1EE4
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x18CE671BED44D2AE042B41E2A9C4368D
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xA384F250011F3041BA2114186230EB70
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0xBC5431FA95DA3B8B740865144A0C017F
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xB31AE8DE51E31E44B9FCE3EEFE8FB2A8
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x32A6085FBD58485BEC7C5F7D04FB2F4F
answer ready."

"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xB8F739D2121731320298901C46230537
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x42E91E9598FD4FC0BEA4E7A984E77FBA
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0xCEF4E66F1061C9E21D2DE92903509CA9
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0xA94E01F73997750314B3A3600AC13616
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xDC39ABE2B3940407BFE065D1C38C2BB2
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0xB7E0691013D8C2FA0F9CCB8E4A761B60
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x1179BB31155C91814D117370DB318928
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0xA1BF791781119F3D86DADADE4B854F74
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x93D3956A9A1452CBCF02E80E9373DC20
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xF3E2B13A6432C63002E996910D5A79BE
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0xFADA46DA2ACF1699862921A2CDF0DBDB
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x3C87E8E48486F6B2C784DA45F540DC18
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x7DF206BBEFB429E3EF337969B7053052
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x00D5F1DE1C656584D74EE346962EE44B
I wished to gain."
0xF5441106472785976C38C2594C582245

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides

me.  There is no merit in such goodness."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x662B60A78FD94330C82A2BD1AE3E619B
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x3853CB1903C139E7B146118E14B4F5DF
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x526E971E1C3F0EB8CA6D0F86937FF4A2
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xAC9EF87189C3EE2F904C542A4D78D4A3
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x27A44DDB5411DD31DE2CA213DA2B060C
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0xC60927A0C13CDC0C913252C0315799F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to

please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x8AA6E6490DA8C4E18D62947AF96015C6
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
0xE3D782FD238BB96E1FD4EB455F670323
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."

In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
0xD1C222E57FCBB65AF7D4F32E8893C051
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
0xA06687053683F6F4CD93D66639161067
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
0xA71425C102B3CF47AA356F91AA64AFBB
remark, but she said nothing.
0xF3469CF84EB2CF47C734344475217150

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad

woman?"
0x7338AD917792204E2CA8AE684340B152

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
0x222B96F12BD509919E6A641D2070C56A
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x66D03C57E87A98622DD6B98BC89C1845
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0xA53E69D20CFED779C7922D53D6E7F510
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x3E992B43C5E5DCD013FCF5555BF04D0C
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xCD33B797A17BC9274132B1DC49C50FDC
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xC597E88547BCD39B75BE43E862AF1629
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x5E317279D322F8B22C8D13D458222E15
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x6B63C7817614C2C103997375F2A8D3C4
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x4C1DABF8E3A14F40D8486FC8402129E9
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0x855930121EA511098E3B29CE5BE4B07B
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x0B4947C4B7F9AE51F6BFEB762882D3E3
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0xACAE171174CC3EA0B959EC7643010EAE
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x5664D5F5B92867C83688C3A555B4471E
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x0458CAEEC2E47C07D2F1D8AF9AC8158B
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0xA5FDD38F501DEC74FE531F3E51B8D88E
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0x40B751D873DD30BF69D63E14FDF06A9B
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0x2E5A6B3C1A89218740896F117C35F9B7
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x29864C1F71CFBA992598C2E7FDF1927C
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0xE0986D4C60657D4E78F69C601F22786F
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0xED84F2CE0FFA04267D7E6EA5F96A1575
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xC1E95FDB22AE08B0B417434EB45EB6FB
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x92FAD11DBBF60FB818046939F63ED27B
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x1991550DC7D7A752B7A70766463DE635
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x1FD901B222C3A7C2CA20859AC447C339
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xF3FF7C8D5579F30CFFF402ED2FE758EC
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0x70F877073B4972DFB71711059E383355
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x4FF8BE95AF4E3D4FAADDF27158668A8B
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x11BF6AFF8111C7FC5B403BC75E5744BD
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x13120CDD76AEBEA866D519D9D5474E7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x2B85790222550A632C885187ED0CA333
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0xE39584CDCC1F01EFE7121323162C903B
without reply as without delay.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x90998B53F15536778CDA5FE18DE55D5F
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x79598457F89A28FC97720B5D72B918A1
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x435A7F094A9D46C7601E1E664D889C88
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x89A335160ECAB346D25EDC1109B176D5
were no trifles.
0x2CE0C7474E57ED4BF0BF90D4265C9C71

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x0262BF7CB45CD04666F3E0B4F19051FA
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0xAFD2CBA5AD85269AA10B22C3DB9170E3
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x576B60B653563116E61EF87B32F8B580
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0xAA366B93AAEB59652A6E64D78A51D68A
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x114C164179D8B82D2F01E5CBBA342F55
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x063B2F179DC42F100224AA91C398F3D3
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0xF29735A313EC68A963D6D56F14D9C78D
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0xE5A330978FCF96E3558B1D15D16A9BDE
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x0F3062493198D80AD9E37FE896667A6D
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x9C7E062127C8381FDC237787C920AAFE
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xD1F5BA48AA7A9719690D93EF49F3F686
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x889AD48E95B93272B3C35E08C5D36184
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x6BBFC5AFE486F4F86F23879C458C70EB
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x45DC06CFCB2F9BBC009FF1246E573B95
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0x1AC7BF0ADAEE6C739CAD4891D59F80CA
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0xEE31C3A1A31033E134F37749B4299DB2
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x6E787818B4330662ADD843166626A715
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0xAC570C19FD53059D8380B514E543D096
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x10A58E720A75CA5269C6280A00F10196

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x00DC5837A86108F6482D8958F4E32B5C
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x535C408755F2F50B31FFF548B2627463
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x7A4D33D2D8585465E774809485457342
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x5330EE8A40E8472979A4117182E95740
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0xDABC371A4DC3756EF5367A65F8D8442A
meals, was served round between the services.
0xF4A5FB203239C28D7645F6B864854933

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x6809B79C2D6D5BE22A9C964C0B4B5912
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0xB3E80E93659238CB04274A3A47865A36
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0xD0D8033EFFA5586ACDE2A29B051A6845

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0xF6779A9D4952C076BFAFFF8C5A061444
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xC2CCCCACAFFF4BFF1DFF5F2BF2969668
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x5992E8C59DD69DE0159EA62EE277495A
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x6A7D601C0752DE4A52A2656630D58545
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x5DE06CFF6D92E29680851DE664E471EF
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x515093F39466D773915AF1406BC52546

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xD78546E3F7023593D80EC81A24747FC9
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x6C4AB29EF2B19EAD3B0B43CC439FF2B6
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xD87F62B56DF48278917A53663924F36E
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xBBCE3D498F4D023CF04EDFD784CAAC78
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x8F7979EA55F786415384E7DEDB7AF3C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x861D12CFF5B36A3CBDEF6EDDD43591DF
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x29FCA3C1484BB717A39F0D0A9A449702
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0x6E83EFDAC4F228703802CED00A98EB5C
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x9DD216769F47909EEDC9FDF6E2AC963F
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0xF43CD64DAA666CCAC01A10B78BFA79F4
invariably obliged to part with.
0x4672FE02835CD060C940521825467464

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x986B0122047AB2098773AFCDD4A4A68D
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x585C5EBD861E4CA48044945CA2261F9D
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0x1F2800450F74D625DB0C53E96DEEC45B
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0xAD9BBF532792F403A7827B6E2C775785
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0xF31223F4E36238970EA86378DB658AC1
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x4CD7DCD447B917CA82F129520294E384
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x6B7BA040AD1FD17CE7D0F45452F57FD4
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x308F014F4A9FA26E8AE25FE9D35C4003
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x82AED9DAE4E614FFC0EAC2145AB4C080
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x11A26F1B81ABEB6FECF91FB6CB8BBE3B
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xBDBD78A5E3620800CCF23E37AC181774

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x5B07097C975D32C660D2806ED23D3141
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x42407BC96CC41A57E9420D63EEB35EA9
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0xEA84A0423D50E7411A1CAFD7C20DCDBD
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x6F725D751632B736EE82A0A4D6C1D974
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x6B83AD29F5F40771AC950D993ECA5FE3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0x54B952FE522EBA356F382DC113F036B3
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xCAB6DF76DA8CA65FC1351B6AFA5EBDCC
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x2AB1E86B9C85F729D383E97905473B75
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x877200B947E977D62263DFBE104AF866
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0xB58D4A5DB8757A388C6D40B58FE46085
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0x30A6CE8E2A5453F71F4DC71874AE3E42
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x50DA49FCA3C51A060756A56B99A3D931
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x0D83A2CE1B7B86A94275BF1DC12E4820
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xFBE6252F61C8943B177ACDF17DD68BE1
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0xF70B956711D120A047914DAB70969FDC
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x10ED80902B48F4DD62D924FB2FD2C686
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x8A133030407556651FB3E375675A0612

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xEF9EF361674BEB6911714BDB31316164
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0xBE6724CF00FF45C9752FFF61F97D0701
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0xC3A9710BB49B5E6CA5118F9AE25D86CE
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xD3F343FD4F3211CEB011AAA22F1E1744
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xBC977D6C41C45D9A111D07379CA956A9
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0xA79E4E45443708C9C4E28C0510178672
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x77E342E03B2F7814BB6015FC81D30E48

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x6621B13F722CE2AA75922FB25A72B0A1
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x5A769997E9BEAD4BB9ADD44B5C764BC4
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x35A000D94448BBCC235D0CFAFBA59698
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xB2F6370FB923AFEAFA2A597EE2DB2C26
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x4EEB53BC813B7E28C4D544A0C7E13506
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xD60C15AC50F6EF3944DDD873440BCD56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x0F740D67B56FEF5CD3407B829E41F8EB
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0xF6CED494FF00F5AFF150A5B7FEF1A297
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0x1E383A401F4E6B4A979488483AA4A774
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x710B54DD3C18DE6752DAE38627C083F9
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0x79C9937F5CF55147D1DF3B1B8FF483B4
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0xC4E8F7F7840B51D13B0C0242DC519689
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0xA34BA0310E379187AD4563F39EA420C5
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0xB972027523994537D69D76E507AF65F2
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x93398FCE6A00677A4C12595055ABE6D3
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0xD8833C6F02DFD6A5CF34DA2B6FE42FAD
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xB4B433019BE3160F0D918AAD70905C31

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He paused.
0xD0D75CC3AE5C85CE133D1BE34230045E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x9B88C930EFCBC1E3A876FE79CBCA0AE6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xE8A32D965A90E8EEC8BC6FCAA85A6BA3
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0xB0DE5A7EC035F4158522C2F9018B3FDC
to one."
0xEF410ED51F0144964C99052E74DE7DC4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x116A7ADDADDCAEC5BC750A8FF4B45D15
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x6DEC3C685E8D83E935A50F9CB1AF1007
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x92CC5630281800A083012BA1773220CB
occasion."
0x54279D46F883713029664F601E08E1C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0xEBF8B316318EE06F24014A1CC7543411

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0x75AC0977F313CA932CC91254428DBC53
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x97227F90989EC8E54B309CF61E42EA3F
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0xAF3C53DD1E1B9A40DE8E35A673413A26
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x5B646B19534DA41BD98B0B5FA2E3E654
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x9100A566BCE82B39E473D38116AEC5FA
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x2055337DB8CAFE247395B3B4B89BDDB8
what authority?"
0x4265F18F93B41622D3574C2EEBDC72A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0x843C35BEDB95121D31028C607CABF5C4
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x08E81D8FF2FAD0BBD2688E60E1AD0774
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x96AEF0E045645F31D188DF5883195E09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0x3B0E534792B00CDE85BD71F4ADA7D88C
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x3A6A24CDE7326C0C6B660EF42EDC428A
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x3BEDD85289683D2F85C8B8FD9303260A
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0xF1CCDA0FE24EF98FB199EB71A1AD2FBE
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xC4C247C9433767C4EEFA4809BF43A290
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0xD1FE5417EBEB8AD384F25D7C5CF9F255
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0xEDBD501090B6E2896C5AE3ADABD82D46
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x7763F5E6B44D67FA9AD0C01F45A100BB
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0x2C8607A0EB6D6B7ACC8F15BEE0B50278
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0x2FE70AE88E1FE1A1E5FADE019AC03944
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0xFE4043D105BC05CC2134783DD41DCCAC
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xF65AEF2768825D9690A7B86BBCD3BFFE
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x774F4951785E5F9D74567FB47D5CE184
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x0131ADEEADAAE08AF0D9A3920A25C53F
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x8E4444794B8168673DE98B3193682D6F
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x4946928A7AF8D863D1AFF56D060B3931
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0xB48631288C2FFEF0DFB967F985D3F6FC
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x692B9774F4F5D31DA23C6DF2226C9CE3
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x2B2EFE5FFD4CE7F533C6F1033393482F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0xB1D9B5E16309B55B67121B762C42FAE3
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x8161553AD7D49B191D5F0D68F5AFD415
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x12DDEC7F9555726DC4C3EBB7F280F1A2
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0xCA413E3803738272BDA43CC3F216B153
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0x4B7740BCC1DD13FE1316DF0BA3F5C9EB
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0xE69E29C43223997DC96DB13E587C7B79
severity.
0x839853BCEFD6E84B7938C79C70D03E46

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xA372CA69C35903522F53CA39354AE963
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x5FEF105FD2FB04979AD9FE45234C8195
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x367290B47B36C100DF8917C53EA7FAB0
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0x594FE7B9873B598712BB2D57BEDAC58E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xF4E0A142B26B62BFC79F723F9D313012
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x587BFB0F3F785D90E6790393D1CA3583
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x473689997F618C8855E889888DAB0E1A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x9C0B80C49D38ACA7D116880A74CCDF94

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x21DB8A8122E900B49C31EA6A3426D771
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x9E96D2699ECC469742F420BF3EA479E3
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xCD06BDC2ABABA4805D525482F677C376
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x35867C6F442999CDE5D775BADFDA209D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x9D64DA15A51E92C58A43DBD60021AC3C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x2B85EEC15A027D37FD20AE65E3973528
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x77847C6EDF2B704FBC5D8074ED97E230
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x153000E775695F46696755F537080CD5
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x762F4E0B0F6E918C67C7CBD4108B0DCF
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0x2CF3900DF783937AADC65723BE085336
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x8FDB2C7071A1A2E5652CD107B1C153E1
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0x07C99CA0CD9F266AA6126AD469D27C64

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0xDE2411C87BBFFDE20E1803CC9D9227E1
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0xB94E2D6B0BEAD3ED3C7A442984DF7765
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x955E219D9665B0411027A89D6C6AA2F8
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x2FB29C468748AE205EA60BF00C843D21
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0xB1BD62A527788AE9CC98FC7F685D9869
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x4775748C21E8F19E6AA47FC9E63FE2A7
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x2F95670DE139FEC8473F15B43EEB8187
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0xE9A6C87818C8869A6FC402A671190CF2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0xDDA607C121994F77F47F44AF53644A93
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xEECBED4C66320F0ED28E00891F7009B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All those top-knots must be cut off."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.

"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xDA969D99D18F8E45EA4D2AD03595D129
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x571FBF8B70C6007BD483A04DCC1C6BD3
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x6FDF2412F0CAABBA8DA898523D837CD6
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xE2C25E94209157B5B9236D94B4FB8255
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x394FFDA6224E55BA1102756B36711121
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x4A9829E2255BD1A4E7996F9D8419A786
time wasted, of--"
0x47C1FA41BF291E35F86F0730129B53BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0xF367836B8B81D68106C6A594EF4BC65C
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x767955BDCC446B3C0D34643AF9E7866D
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0xD91B9C4521E76E23570DC74EDFFA7591
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0xC644ED242B0CEB92F40EF728C36B544C
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x93B73B40B61502F343C88D737D4D207E
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x6CF4E2B06FCDCC577713D4184CC32228
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x509506EFF08338F44BFFEB5C9B840034
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x4BC439D027B0BE3FF48D60996D2ACC3E
false front of French curls.
0xD49DB227B160FB346F9ECE345D1327FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x9B67C1C4C1CC2BA8AAB1BEE7EC8396AD
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0xA36765BDD692BF8437A408D198EA8CA7
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x89C0D2770804E0791AC04E5E6F69FAD8
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x4DB3942208308400B557B65D132356C9
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x4F292574FF3C7C3614631761CEDF66B9
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x39B6A67145944F2C1D25F8F6D1B7D920
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0xF33704F31600CDE810C81E1057F865F3
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x8AB862672BC6E128E7EAB2D56C13A13E
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x5F42A509F8D33A673D7A8D0ECE07F0F7
my attention.
0x3732F0976C5899523936F5ECCFA63C69

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x3CA67A4290311F5477C8C78DC328F179
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0x68E8AE62181A27672A035131BC5D8EDB
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0x7E021562CF8A6D9FE947F87497BFDC62
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xEEC8281883EAD6CC99564A407882289A
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x0D9BAFE35513002B6E6E29A5AA09F497
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x2B88E303324FB73E12AABC030E3D4AA7
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0x564C93D0C1620EB96A93872A334372DD
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0x58353AB47464834E3A98EE7927E90479
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x04058FAE22B7BA20F94F9D103BB22FB8
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0xAE09A924B50D2405714DB224B92911F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x3BABBA97FCE440C1DE82D43B9FDF4835
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0xEBB4CE95DD0ADE060E142640FAA7B0AD
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x7B05C1D8543EB53CE320771089AE01BB
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0xD3A5B0D05EE4AE866ACD7F500DE1AC23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x909032E58271662B6698ACAA88A21F62
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0xCBC6E969B60B4481EF56A0011612408E
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x73AA801E562D0C226417BC41B19A38B0
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0x6E03534CA871CBC3D3D104E79AE0F7CE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xDF0F0258E75F3BC2B5C1B08159643820
punished."
0xFB969830DD4C914FF8F827459BD02CD2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0xB733FCD7B59F57835F8590D25B637804

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x6FCF9F44902735D7771A40E6A083E9CD
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x9B3FA3A0C3FE444EC4C3A066D5996221
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x998271300F9FD305F30DE766C847EAF5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0xAA2D885C726DC94A3085217B1D1C5164
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x8B217B5C39E552F857CE447560A1CD4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Place the child upon it."
0xDF1DD939E276778FE70FE39099EABA73

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x5927EA479E0A7F45B82CDC37B21D027C
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x9F5B217F1E399A9771ECC7B37579707D
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xF430798305ECF535AAE2459DE801BE7F
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0xABB5A9F10F4DA52809BABFA4E823EA0B
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x80554F4152F6828BF712A9128B75D15A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x3488C2F13E1353C119E683D93C5E8953

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0x1814EF449B0372EEC072D07CDC23C423
children, you all see this girl?"
0xA7E983D33B2B32375D56BB15E5F6B388

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0xD308E30845B82A31A79AC9B1B62A18DC
against my scorched skin.
0x26EFC360496B3ED88B3BB0AC9F13F3E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0xCD538CBA9E82856309E4D99A613FE48C
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x2259A3914D372DE666314E22A7AFAE9B
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x3D8292CCB2FA5CCE57ECD7360711ECD2
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0x3BDC573BEC4707898CB68E7E1373924C
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x6F1F46EE4BDD923C9F8C1ACC7EBAE076

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0x7952B799A3594E538E3B58E17E84B48F
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xE015F98B4FCDF4A36684D949881EDEF9
must be firmly sustained.
0xECA69CA67837AA1668C0CDA61EAA9042

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xAA36884D030D81B809F6A7C22D275861
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x94E95F83D610DA0EED0A4C6E2C9AA018
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xF6F9A39376359D78D291D179A3F9C36E
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xD246D9B3CE7AD6D52BBA9AEF6F3F24CD
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x804DAFF5B4749C6865056B4BDC422F8B
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x4E74236A6C76DC57E4532F337D180058
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0xEC62221B4C18C0E0687BC45DDCDF5912
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0xA45DB274847183E49966B09927BFE0E4
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0xB805FA1F94E6E3921EF8E6F1DCF0AEB6
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x327C85E4F20740658174A675AB63B2A4
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x27B17E478508A3E3169D731E9C3BB7D4
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x2252D0B82DC9DAC1D40BDC34CA35773F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x1CFFC86F8A8D7CCF364843F8B4ED7E4C
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0xFD93304E72B7199375CA1318D0CA730E
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x89857D84E2763C62E9B35C6D683DE01B
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0xF84418FD05C3858E227A7DE8F76A620A
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xCE47B226A47EEDD46A0F73E587DCFBC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0xDE5DA20828EE9E24F414390AB38B7BA6
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x5B20AE1B208AFAD7C73A163A64CBE54B
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0x7A9D6AC002F305AE97423BFE65134C54
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0x03147FB96FB02A843217ADC924750DF9
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x50840602E87E87A8C82FA6A68A147861
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x86276B42E7DAFC72E6B029D2EF01140A
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0xE0BD02E7E39550AD3BC8E9523FBC6113
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x4B9B8D2DF8F3CCBC8B7020B714E24F5A
waters to stagnate round her."
0x1F112BEEA4D0D4AC4A417C84F6E686C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x017DF39A380EA2E5F8FECA3F48B8FC28
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0xB7E9AA638B368EB605486EF66CF2CB02
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0xD6A2C5056FC0BFF2429355D9DA6FF069
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0xC0A76AB52AC074D67E0BB8EF85E3E2DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0xD3E209B93565D1CCA652630F063E5621
her during the remainder of the day."
0x4B62005A0EDDA509F135E0F69E10BF37

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x395B9CEBA128917260B7FBBDEC615B08
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0xB6AE9EAA6E275417412BD2EB1B921FC9
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x4B83D9CBFAAC9F108567DF79699F1709
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x2BAF563EF60DD7C553879AFB8D1BF985
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x77FE8DE677FCB3F66B886B2F62A8D352
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x4532014088157D41B95486CDD4006CBE
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0x5268D509081C37D77D03C085D24A8EAF
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xA2D83DB4A575C8ABAE73E36D3B33A7E8
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x8A5C6649680DB21537ED0584639F00AA
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0xBC7CC3D3A73791EA01F919366272BBBD
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0xB6036A54DABF7462E5FEA34FDC438825
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x14F3A766F31CCA34399F03155A849B05
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0x1383EA6525A5154505D6529B27FBBC21
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0x7E070742B8C7CC1374120F46FA4402A6
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0xB3963119DDD4C164D9F908440F6187ED
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x45A9E11BFDF3FB22FE936B7C374DC5A6
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0xF134FFBF6781BB7122B08B1048669662
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xA6BBD7D4E44477694E4DAE71BC002DFE
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x7966B2A176E30188A54071A2142CD28F
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0x80B42B2004A22010997B89FC80634852
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x2071D9C2D140DDAB9315A44AAB136E78
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0xE0C4AAF5BCED563BD69096E8858EFE4A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x387952C9F7AE575F8FCDA67379C55FD0
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x282267742EF26D5DDEFDFA004E27B3E3
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0xB83C8931B2E8EBC59F316FBE33757AB7
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0x35BC4FCFC9186E5094E9200339A09839
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x77EF470BFB31A0BD350C5BBD8DE94B5D
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xAC930E4636937FF9B0001D833E6D81B3
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0xBC1E39D4DD81F29C63512692BD507D38
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0xE2774CE762EB26C87193B0432DB4E95D
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x5761C8C86DB49CA357AE6EBFE2A6D551
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0xDB99094650898A0BE0EF7BDC015D8596
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x0F7549DC21C702CB90E2BFB87FB01BE7
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x7E4E161C9B732B6896680DDE8401BEEE
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x1C00E484F9FD8B030F790D58A23785CE
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0xCF6EA243BFBD315129F52C462D00B7A5
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xC977AFF7BEDAE84FC7607C941EAA93C0
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xF933BF5AF9C7A0510F6C1583784705B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x452B4EC7AA1400D8297B18BDE43E61E0
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0xCA33C82084EAB271AC1E8A559620EF5C
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x83674DFB567EFF1EA95F39B3F8CB4068
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x18E2DCE31845A4D47B18FBD2123B9B59

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x6574EE221002E9BA9727C1202FC63873
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0xBC1DB801BBF8FACA72A3B108298BB212
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x2B1AEAFFFEB73C8DBD0FD080823B75A5
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0xB0B0F0EC67612B281C3FE0935D86E2B0
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0x4363581C64FBFF8A43D4EF450F8956B0
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x892268D08FF8745AC029584336D0B3F9
first who spoke--
0xD21ACA38DC733A20DC2D7B46C5326239

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0x0B2F123F2CE7FB82673C8FBA08D6EA09
liar?"
0x3648F8FA6AD36BDD5F8161C4130906F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x6F7D01A32DEA04D07260C8210CAE076F
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0xF50B968A620C51F43AD37F9BFCA9845B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0x80A34B163F1F0BDF631B84EC11558723

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x1BC087E50777083142D50F854873CC33
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x47AC8E709B07E42E1BA2C10A503B9C27

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x4474E04B44BFB676943932D94864B700

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x5E8EF372DEF4B827ECF46675B26462CF
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x3ACA882120FD97F0FE65CDA13AC5D0CB
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0x361DB9F114E6B84B430B23DF86EE1DF7
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0xBD279CE15F6D585482DD4D1ADDECD015
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xB3D106B3703BD2F12C7767B23E48F686
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x9DD0C38463367FE8A9D5393B587259C7
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x827708D153FC893906028E2E3D9FC7AC
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x2687598991C7E7C14DAEFCF10B3FC2F4
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x9E15217A2404809750E7E8BC42CEBC2E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x8A2FE31F43D468ED608D36B7D73CB64A
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xC1A52F857703FBCE9BCE8BB11B834DE0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x345E37821073BD83A4AD02F9EF718EE1
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x907EA1DBC47264B7E2D4A123A15DE8A6
without friends."
0x91AEC171D0438BAABC4DAEC746814221

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0x66088703D79985CB77C3138A17E9CD36
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0xEC6BCC778CEDEF017411CEE42BFC99CD
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xDC2D4FC829255859DCD331B6DAC6CCE1
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x5341CDE6263D124B369FA9BA39F565B6
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x7F630E9947145E34ACC8E3D3801677A8
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x8C7AE749D7C2F9EB06F910AF4AF86C4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0xAA7D7213DC652687BA80BCB908754E00
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x299891096E14EAEE8AC553E50650F2CA
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x54FDCE6D0CAD84C48498D762773ABE0E
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x73623D2DE1636140413E845874F76780
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x7B6505BB3E739FB1AD61D40FC92AD9A1
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x6675E52B92B0568C8B82F2C4A2AC9BF5
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0x63DFEBCB1A8CB618B53A16659F656B84
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x38C718A7EE21AD6F9F0021062CDA48F9
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x4F5DC05785EC05DA6FA812BD81EB2603
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x5486BAC95D188EEDE44E4BE2C1C81D3F
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0xBEA2102B37A962B3E7653DE84C759B34
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x8C90D7C7682232564CB6A211F2F02C5A
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0xC1A8071B8B635BEA65CAB840F7E672EF
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0x53566E5E1E858D7AFB303DC60B213603
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0xA568EEDCC4ED55F4F01AFB6F3D633B8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x8DF8B2C703E2AA2F3E1B425452324BA7
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x10B01AE808DBB431FA1C39B55C930CA7
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xE7A9FDE2A5612C617319DC395975FC2C
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xB534BC13B535AEBBCC4EC4EE0B517ECD
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x0D0CF6EE1253B4412481181AB46A290B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0xCC592857C04FEA29F93543A4434D984A
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x02C97DB040C611A780E7DC46D41F5165
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0xF46DDA05DC5DD1A1D4323C23220520A4
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x11350CFCC3A768D2A462474559239F3F
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0xE7CA35D02D92D62EA48B520F50EEE68F
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x37E529AF683B72399744C166DAFA5AFD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xBE1F7D3C8F8D869A1EB7DC72A44842FC
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0xE9C86366A73D3DE2D251C97706242336

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0xD45AF8F61917B15CFB53BA647EE70F8E
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0xFC8A7590FC8E076DE24803927E02A337
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xAA7748130214B18BBF3AA5664F41B62D
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0xADDA14C2D299C0C6FE021A7D95C7ECBA
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x56875CD736B5084BCA3B5B2739171FB9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0xDDE4FE573C68D2FC1C0383FD50CE619E
your grief away?"
0x2DE953BF66441D949E3A8E6ABFC210EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0xC08E589D65429DE7ADA73E21591C944C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why?"
0x1A7509121D2A3E91F1A46D4D531250F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x4FB1925EBA9258787660AE749C4B0911
will now think me wicked."
0xB48680880CCD1B80D19C41063EF053F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x8641B95987773F2A6CEBA59628704B83
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0x4229C650C506812661D3478FCA22A81C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x40B4E85FDA93502B6DC1CEC5F0387015

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xD09758DA60748AEB67EFF1590B2218C5
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x45AC18F534F3CACADE982E5137DA8C81

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x2A5D05CA387696E6F98A589CB1B4B1C7
care."
0x21B554F33E83EA16C6735E8168CBE5B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x2B359989A37FA589DE5BFF75A1B7FB36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xBB6433878EC65368D63628AA690E382E
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x68D8CB5396F2BC8C75CF6AD9A13EB66D
always keep me."
0xBEE3170A08632C492B912A5DF09C22B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xD4A82C9901B4AD9C6C1A494D6AACBE70
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x02886B8CAEFFDD7DA8529EF49D255FEE
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x3100B584AD82279CC5804E8F1F6FEDE3
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x32032553480F5E46D9CE6D6B213840AB
exaggerate nothing."
0x479892D4980000EE9FAF9D1259C82584

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x33DA7FFB3FC59F1C8182342B41FA6D1A
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xA34C3F60E9486F195158EE241FB0D38A
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x78C6A63ED2CF3C3B0B6735E858081689
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0xB876F7F2E21798CB230A57429569BE22
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x5C03E2CA5C2729FBA6E6A2512156D027
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0x9A0FE93B9EC85A0A864D36AC6C5DD2D5
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0x569DAC92FD07F7CDDD0E491C7EF0D838
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x8660D7E458D10C7B04568FC85B8BF51B
Temple fully believed me.
0x0687ED97167AA13C3FC331E900C27202

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x72F3F18171D0846F7618CAA7F5C341BE
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xE5A9033D8FF89BB8606824DAEA2C0C8A
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0x4905F7D912238A788D4D8D0A4E596673
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x68086717A6EF2E742909BEAEB7D754F6
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0x9E3AFC8BC78268FC1A81BF8C24A512FE
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0xA3A62AFD8B820F041689D926206450DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x2E40FD3844E00BC0E84DCC944B62FA89
then said--
0xCF17AEA492029B13248833E00BC35890

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0xA619E830BB71ABA412878BF80345BE77
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x7CF299D292816BA15FB9D3B8F0FE7661
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x68C1E4794F8CEE1FA69733F8E43524FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0x46E444E2DAF809B08B2C01DBDC4AD4B9
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x6B4359612234C8F97E84D1A7FF0ACC95
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0x7ECD8BC00FEEFDDBD53816D8882B0B56
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x64FB53F0B5F7D9A2F22BED45C90F8D79
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0xEABF323FAA46A82997676715B4C8DF5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0xE55475B0646866754E1562B30A4F86D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x383B7C6C0ABE6169C4CB75120D484BA0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the pain in your chest?"
0xDCA9B84DAC444243EF8ACE4374FFE41C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a little better."
0x494FDD3538C33513C6CAD19F09116771

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0xA637CC2F1FBBAD116760F788DB11AF47
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xAF0E1F16F49CACEE6D18FA49DA3D5B5F
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xC4388FB8C6CF79E589E970F888AAC4AF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xEC0AE0E8CDF14C7DC9983927640A4935
rang her bell.
0xC0A7FF074224B3249D3BE799380D1780

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0xA30568356E8219620A97CC9AFACF92FB
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0x188197BCD0C9160DE7F36ECB1816910C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xA4FBB87620D8D2EA963F9E0268E96A52
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0xFAA2EE7FF5E5B7BAE4B86EF9849EB6DF
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0xD6388C399A7041E17116F8C1B4126598
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x5DF3EF457C77580784E63ACF8F59EA0E
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.

"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0x7E36FEF273FAE7F0A8FD5CF6AC544A1A
There is not enough for three."
0xFD0CB40398E5B5CEC4F53E444476931E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0x3E0793E31DA85BB7790673CFBB357C60

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x79DF3335FCE9D3340362E6C09C40F2A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0xE71BAEC88494CB9332A5A813B3DEFEDF
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x93815760F37BB86919F5B8EAC6572B0C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0xB23DDBA800AD75BA18F6E11B125E1190
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x66F14B8DF1CEAB42CF1696EE50763136
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x240658CD0EB81ED8F33A93DE090C0C5C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0xBE32314EBBD558659912EFC09844E2E2
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xFA7E4980430A12A210D8631879D2655F
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0xC6D2C1D6402BE3B563293FF1D617C996
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x9EBB8CEB31CA9AEA8180C6A4FC3818C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x6AC738BED4905A503AA09CB528F6918A
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x6CB00A94E0242DFEC907F6EAB17B07FA
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0xD0F4219A8A9A158CC4A1D3B870CDCE18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0x8484904580ADE0C4B33509CC2083E163
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x1F1BD0088E2B0C80A6196B8B322216A3
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0xD06F33F614FFA27AC559D0BF354D7261
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x379180EC33A6338D2FE982E7A1E78A41

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xE6E3AC28C45ABB807D006990929211FE
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xDC577F2BB17FEDC3B60B1E18ACE973EF
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x8DDFF383D76C346D5E42C077581C6E75

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x91B4647D14EC32CC1E16CED00EBD2524
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x16006D6A0AE6E02503201A90055FE624
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x92E778C612922A6B760D1463FF6AEAEE
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x406DB4FB2A0F3FCF0A282BCE221EB5F9
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x6872F2BB1803DCB470B110B619371159
struck with wonder.
0xD0A076AAD831B8EBBD099D1E9D538EB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x716DCCA44253DF89D0F86682F1416542
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x14FB331B2DAE7639BB28D874B7F134EE
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0x538CD25D408366521E00E34DDC98FB6A
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0xECA4D0660C57A44C243D1DB9F8600ED8
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x9C4C415C1250BE3E526BD592068DA084
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x0143A7C62D10958288D4AD09AE0662B6
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x0D2AA70841C6DDE1AC75A71A491531A5
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0x60133710044A4FA9E9831DE05F6C9734
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x1633B220B88381486DED2B27F3071D76
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0xD352C9A835CCEE1502A94075A38CC24D
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xBE33673DB6903B6205911A52A79FC2D9
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xBAE97AB5E1F18331E5EE3E9AE0FA81C0
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0xC09BC91464A9BC699DB53B97DE1C0760
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0x97786BD15D90EAEF98FCA5F49F0E2F18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0xEEAF3CB7AD76C97096BF59F140AD3213
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0xF3EF70F0EFD271126143A9E5AE2283B1
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0xCB57E1D98784227CA0369403E46286F2
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x17D6121DA59CDEF36FCDC35FA41AD2EC
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x122FE478CDB2B5FB633A7C4D562B571C
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xE20324292853119EC58C4C9B06AB7060
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x626BDB16C7B239559D125F281FBF6C56
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0x1FABF780C0059DB5D018100C00A6CA27
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x60FE251B481329F52069903A35B1B219
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0x881D3178C4B696A8064750E9D80F4AE4
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x9D12C129AC4FACCB10C1B3281BCBE31B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God bless you, my children!"
0xC8B0E0D137F427D827CEF6AB2DC7D225

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xB2C739EE1728164D7664B338A6EFCFEF
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x6474B98564BC7E12B6822599A22D83E1
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0x4BAAF6DD66CE376116F0F14CAF960437

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x0CD6BB6EFF4FD1F9B9B52E550EE7D983
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x675047FF374722642680F29267BD6319
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x8B021751B1A3A0B1B3FD802EB2E4329D
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0xB535A16A18317A021FA2642A6972AC0D
shoulder.
0x89039575B287988414399A7428E9D0BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x792F7315826F1C7C3643067DC69CEE47
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x0C5A98117DE629C0D5F08BEACF64313F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0xC0051C64CCA5B1BBEDADE7A34508A6EC
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x7D5D963872F4B70C95C1D697E5D8BCE4
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0xBA9F29F07A1D3242DBF557C36AC52C84
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0xB1EAB8F6D33FB9370ACCE485320D2A78
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0xD7BEFE23FBBBFBA4FCB580AD1ABAA2AE
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0x637FB43F3926E7838E26F7A6001DC9EC
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x846FAB717A0D6F8A86845B01BDCD458D
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x0D6CC11A4F249B585A051D091F1D6EC3
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xF08B458D0B4D89C7E641E43EA0D948F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x0D4BB76EBD5F9B012A356E950EADBEE1
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x28E2BB8A56769144D154938621F835BC
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x2A205AEBA4780D96F560F2C278EBE62F
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0xC566E2F135C2C36D39C45EEFAA56B583
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0x94DCC670ECA5639EA4E64EC1F0945868
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0xB0A2D5D763EFEC6B7EC86BA480805B9B
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0xBA8817FD57EB3AF78F831906748A3E8C
through the ranks of my companions.
0x23A270D682BF9BE4EABF5BB0DC4AF6B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x01208D08CD2575320487793E85AC77DA
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xC0C752924EAAFB809557C990B8FC26FA
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x6CD966738D0E75A9BA0B3357B38C087F
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x176F29DA8BC7B3C5D8E92BE7C974EB8A
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0xB539187049AC0993EF14D1061D72D59C
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0xD2E3E730E0D54C56ADEAD5D9A70A3FAE
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x0D230930CEF46CD969EE1DB4F4BC8BC6
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x4ED9C7D56AEBAE6393E98E10F69FE715
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x890F544B66B6CAF81C332781D522DA48
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0xFA7197B402961FADB728751C0EACC265
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0x376E50E5D956E14E196E30CEF13F3D28
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x124AA94AF3D3AB2D44EF30FCB3118E9B
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x018B8D701D94881CC509016449EE263A
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0xF128D481E9DA124EBDACB06E47323F01
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xC20DFEC89987803D3B41E6810D7AA667
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x536AED767B5E4B6E0AD991EDE7DC1784
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xCC87BD5209F3FBB26F5B829DCFE8DC58
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0xAEE9BE30ADD2EE82839021B4B1493E6F
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0xF293C82859E33EC87D160C790CB5EBAF
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0xE79A53FA079560D184AB2AC0FF5EFFDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0xA0F56580CAFF402A3281860E9978A49C
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x7CC498454CB6BBB8671E290B5EAB9176

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0xBD58BE0097A30685EA2482B78242D7C1
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
0x1E9B7DD511AECC77CEB4E3D4960A1E70

CHAPTER IX
0xBF7BE24770E1CC1D6A469AAC2203182E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x427480232F07E5068D55C87139DED66A
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0xB847808AE8E7FF0782B1C79CBC3D582C
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xF8441B92DE4D5B6E429F10357789FDA1
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x2D3FBA6BCC95B7DBD0B2D49C537C0AE9
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x28DFFB53C2E2FEADB6EF14D34459C1E9
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x7BE13B1FA208F888C216AA15A3F9A059
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x2D68DC6C40F33C2F0F565DEFBB14B656
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x8FB3ED151A60DE96A64509521B323040
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x4917971315093CE67CE467933EEE1A66
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x9857A1BB32F7A24499AC241F9DC081D1
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x39F24A6D36E745179BF0F755921498DE
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x1C837F2FF03D574D2F656A1D6F1FC93E
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0xDBC67EBD114E3FED3ED90BE6BB84DAA3
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0xE6E79F33FC00A8BCA2BEBC48AF5CA8AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xD3158FFEF64F64E0AACC3C7EBDB7AFE6
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x89CB53A0C28376B62D032DE8687026D3
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0xB024524E772CB3E6F221E9568209359F
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x8F29B6080FEC8435273F264B0269066F
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0xDDEE5DC96F6C8AA3E50ABB77424CFDF4
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x6F6AB186DB51811FA1E904786381743E
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x6194C2A1B24E230AB51F1A532D6DAAD9
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xC5D4BD4E596CA8D4A6875C109CAC8713
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0xB9601EC05268ABD5D862FCF786247A85
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x299F325B2B7E9433B172513923A72F41
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0xF48F3109FDEFEA5256CD79CF6E22A18D
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x413A6E9D1EBE589C2780899D064D5FC5
of skeletons.
0x2BFD42E56CC335BA57ED56826BA0B937

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0xA17ACC2F853D4670048DF2762ABF6221
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x0E7DB279434A3CC005CE7ECB26449292
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x3627CA3C52F52C2BE52E249FC6961AB9
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x50BF2042A8BFED914D9C55539CB0B608
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x9584F1908156BC2C18684BAE9CC0D6B3
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xFE299B3EBABDEC6DA1C6BEAC90EBF220
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0xC53233D7CFE491EE1BA1A7564582E9E6
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0x3AEC9E09A56A81C179BFAB68FE336011
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x42566A8844EBEE95C2F9BA47A53F0588
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0xEA18166822C35DAF855C746B8361E29B
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x1804C7264EC4B62598C16C944B57A1FE
advert.

Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x7CE59C84E644F9D8307B57DD711014B0
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x4154A9951DBD38ADF93F90CC12E4900A
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xB728AAD2B1979A216FCB3C857B7F05F5
question.

That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x4223E14745568BC749ABC021FBB83DBC
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0x1E04417420F2CB854C11568E17D6BA2A
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x5937D3CC3566B1C18EB289F40A31110F
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x473D595344716C05BFC8FCD09AED4B0B
hospital.
0xE06FD4D43E6B3A4023DBB0C6555D54AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0xD2692C602B9C4F1F9C069E9A5F3461BA
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0xA11CC6685FAAF6EDA7B60E181B68EF11
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x4815B75F2BAF41ABC04F59D82241E0AB
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xC0CBC8385D228F0008FFC046E99ED2C0
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0x644545B33E11400C83A658CC17AC1C6C
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xB65FFC5B7F8ADC1ACEB0F937E9EA5629
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x7392A3A71F24C6B7E0DBDEF9D60FD7CC
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0xE5A1E3AEA13F30FB70A4F5C73A967050
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x60903B911ED0AA8CE033D81621F6E477
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0xDF2C32B2B75B03F570AB4DC094C7E75A
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xA7BFBB3F6025AAAB2DA8275E114A66B5
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x0B3580AFB7887C125851BBAE3EE16CD6
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0xE3429B6C06A69EB3C5141510F3AA3096
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0xCF50B5577605B7E3E6D241E07B0A6090

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x3856AB5A3C1B66BB8D05D287C656F8FA
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x2DE03E50E41B3C996F0EFD1A1F0D5CDD
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x4C1E811A849F6EA69237190578976FA1
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xC58D953EDCDBF89F79A8CF8AED3BFD6A
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0xB923BF85C28549865C4E3954C126EAE9
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xB9D4AC6279A9B5F60B9FF8D53C08DD4C
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x72BF4015BDFE45AE6C78F3DCB275E8B9
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x944C6C020D0157D996C5470FDEA35EEF
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x36B059923CC89B7995569E64A9BE7B99
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x3CB01E094D6853BD0C9ADBF9C832CF6F
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0x3EFC4F4E8F27A2236C10C81342AC0E11
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xD632CBE7B6C4D6491C3C5266093D1732

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x97DA643E53366D3B3CBA89373C0DE46D
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x65A5EE33C36FCC46C5E94E38EEBE921D
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0xFCA76C59409836775828C6FAA7E437DF
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x9FE470713122E738241BBD233D5705B0
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xA273D3295E567C6D96D4A59E023AF09C
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x3D404AF250CB7B324DC3A536AA715A59
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x95BB0FEE5C2AE5A1087D562C54685B34
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x7206FE1C16B2464F04F1CF16697D7B27
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0xDF917753608083CEBB72979E1D6B8C3D
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0xF4B4DBBF06359D4723A4FAC6E16E26FA
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0x9B2ABE295F2FEFB416B074A463000F11
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x186ED3A095B5DBA0C7D745B780CB3C0B
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x052032BAA4D7748F9437EEA66286CD76

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x7374B6327763F6671B67566080BF2C71
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0xBECDED866BC7B6079D1A3784541DB935
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xA5BC62FC1BE208B1DFCE91F4DAB81DB5
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x1C2FDF9CA4347C56B62C16CD34998BAE
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0xB0BCF98C031ABE177E2BB307EBA3FE51
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0x07E6705C6FC1C8E937B41BE93FF499D0
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x3F054B4433769263A2D2C0783BBB02FA
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x843A82A3696C6861E2B368242B377573
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0xB9FB8F6C31A921A47C58AD92EB602E54
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0xD618A1931C3BC559F922E03D6A1DD63F
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x16F51CC2036F6777B62E95D063CBB42E
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x7491EDBBCEFDEE82EA280B681729644F
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0xA4D34553766E3BE81EC1FB6A0566233C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x053695A333F05B1FFFDB3B6D3D3ADE4A
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0x30315DFF3871688FC5DAED5AE310FEC6
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x030727DE48ECA7FABB76ECFEC99EDEC8
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x85848C523882B4B0D6CF4E8D1E92F35A
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x9C90E6773C28F073159B31C7EB42921F
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x4F1B4DF7712462B1631FEBA492ED2CB2
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x70FD36014517534621B6A8B12428D49D
higher things.
0x1710F6FF0C82D2ACD643A21F2A271717

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x365C1F73A2D50910F98C3BC9455381C9
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xF95B8927F2876499E25C96628D08ECE2
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x3749BFA7ADF0FCBF29B8AC15454B1BDF
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x6D068BBC8CA8EF0FD4E24DC725A76790
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0xB5A40D3616EE1BC75090BC4F799BEA37
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0x3E87D97BEFED151521E33DB38C24943B
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0xC07E231D3E39524EAF483C162624F69D
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xA5AE1F6B44B53B96AC0D7B3B7E7CD80F
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x10708534133A2577486E1D384893DBF8
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x451C7711F25F6ABBE4FCFCBD1AC10CB5
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x7236616ABE08197F73C653A51C2E47F5
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0x69C6463A1F778B8CBD79EBF70EA0C2AA
alleviate.
0xA73002B20C23B9FF4EAC2FE8987006D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x958D9A9B28E07CEE25FEDED679E9BA07
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x6B5F708C16A2E2B70577B40A38C80A0B
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x644E6806BA9063BCDF34BDD06B08FE80
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xE86180026482910ABD301185CFBDA501
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0xACA8A1D304DA0CEC76785CC84661C2CB
verandah.
0xC3855E6AAF03A9979212854E3D89D5CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x9E907058CE61C3B70E07BECC99AF28B9
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0xF4D0EDEAD57BBC6452979ABF74C7AFCB
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x360BBBC702D87447068049AD666957AA
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x6244EA17C338582BC1DED62373845044
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0x4CF53BDD6BE5DF842E3B53472DB01E72
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x951A6C9A2E857F3D5B45F3AED7E20B3A
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x2AD05D76247DD1DEB719E018610CA643
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x587E8A3B7A4FD225FB2EB7303BE66136
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0xA1CF9D6AF394DEE8BC72E256DCC3249F
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x2F593B608D52CF81B338F5477A808379
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0xF9730105A9C11F9A0C6F51D8AE37DFAE
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x0F3026BB2ECFECA7C07670737ECF3268
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xD0E4BC593E257A9B73E94968F985513D
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0xA5998012DEAEADE8FCF708903B4378E2
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0xEE2ED2D70BF4861D35A96F795945FB13
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0xA60C1CD4FD06F4DCB0E37ABECE2DDAEE
done before:--
0x01660ED2811DB3AEDD036147A60F1BFF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0xA4EE62636153F11B0970ACE133916596
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0xBFE1D875932C5CEF93F59152798D302B
have to go who knows where?"
0x097821E8428C13BE04503555C5E5B751

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0x8AF6297E459BF8A601FC2636F0F84E10
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x8F0857B1B4165F9161BC5D039D7376C7
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0xA0EDB4BA229DD3CE97D1B1298D979845
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xAB026AEAF142CEFFE252181B12133292
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0xF7E50C99E476D26F65BC56524C0D89B1
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0xBD29D5AF64C5939EEB9E3D9B93B86F3A
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0xCB9585D895642C1C5C4EECCC23E7850B
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x33EE22531E8FD79899045B1B82080BA2
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x8CD71BB19D78F11940EFF0AD8932FE52
ran up to her.
0x3BF90CC1E296C05BCBCCC1BBC9020859

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xBBD6274F4548741D7B1568CCAC52BECC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0x8743F042AFCB72AB99C8823EDC5914DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x93F947A46DD97514E2444025285E1161

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what does he say about her?"
0x48A68DA1BE12186D8B80C9362A5F6727

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He says she'll not be here long."
0xFD40C34E11253271B88F390FF0CEF206

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xEC4E81E330B72C836A4C90443E1D1929
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x06D67CF6D97A855E51601FE87DC16636
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0x682A77D92436CA079B94ACD952DEE30B
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x12B561BB9C9144DB50B619D9FAC51DF6
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xA235A3CF7CD1741B5E9C259B3423CA14
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0x5B45CF7AEA169BE48481EE2DE6AC15AD
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0x5D15D8696DC921ED68E5CB913C79B57B
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0xFCE4003D8147456FC667561806A5A4B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xE016869902F1A0DFC66DEA5CBE28F424

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x8C56883D03B95A8655BBA9D8914E91C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x68BBF171B012DB670EF6A0388BCE48BB
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0xD3D9AD8D911C3408601D5E3855F14B77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0xE109F1704A236BF8D279EC487EAD8663
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x81BD377A156E62C51686240A7B3F12BC
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0x985CE8FF4485B063DDD5DCFADCDAD2FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x24A8A1BA7AEB97D93DB9690F16CB557A
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x3CE784C158ED65BB2DA3D789BD1388A9
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0xAA59886BDCCBA4A276D36A76B8E91CA1
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x9FD03877D47CD6F1BD9CA2E2F08D88DC
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x8565B9181EAD26C7BE3B0EB63BB8DFD9
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x39A0B8C70BC39A622AF14BAAE1E815C2
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0xB8541E334E65B8CBD4EB8E754648D07B
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0xCE746F19236AE585B5227F83ADE0FC8B
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x18FE1699F36430CE6251ED29064A1F00
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x04C018666714EA53B148A5C1BCE1D6E6
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x3D4073A39A9C69CD0AB91178D6906027
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0xAAA759A3CE354BA7D1CB19D970EDDC6A
with her one last word.
0xFB6AAF753B934472E20C159178508187

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x898EE956D2901BDD31543089AB898512
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xDCBB2DBE049FFB74C56785E744AFC031
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0x08D9FEA8287A1A3230D5A92E7078D583
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0x2E7EDA9924EAEC083734EA8389F6F827
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x9129DF151E8E689D383D697EC827D052
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x09595ECADD55B033F6A0623E2F908684
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0x30EE04F42EE191109458D38AF5C681C8
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x81D7F5C4D44951E709C6EEA517BA707F
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x295545CE9D5FFC0667C1357D69784DA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x95D7FD188BE69847473EDB20C2AFF68D
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0xEBCD1EAB21721AD6E2A14EB66A3FCE11
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x4C6F3435247B9074452BAFDCC202540B
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0xFC74601B1B815231434199B6DADC86F5
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0x834C7444EC7AF14134B1C39F7597639F
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x4F9EBDB2348458FE7B8DBB4E9656D617
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x206DA69DF148C3ABF582297B947121CC
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0x8917EEE3BB9F873D3655610BCE236B3F
of seeing a corpse.
0xC9437895D8ED8A79BECAA22972B35F4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0x48A8D46AE4A72B59FEE5F7465FFAB5A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x8E463C61FB0D9DEF8F80C08BFC90A8AE
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0x2D0508318DA6D2883F33E927FF2436D9
instantly dissipated.
0xCF9CB21B349F3C28BD999FFF7B2A6B76

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xA10795B9A6CA0D24488A9022805CB75F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x970850A512ACE1330F742E2DEBD90C79
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0x25E1590629E6C1B5169ADA80D01B2955

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xD13167CB48F5B21D1ED26FE6A37F6EA8
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x55EF3F55F2264F3AA6381C16E0A2154D
old.
0xA4C2944E97795560F00CDAD2C3573411

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0x77D1F456125E65493D04AC3C909BC9CF
strike some minutes since."
0xF865E16E4FC142E17B0336F3BCCB8598

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x7E16B66F9BF3E90B94DFBD5B8519B972
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xE39B98643FBA5DA4807A836EC734858B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0x912761E24E5A3A3830F08D395B8C974F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0xF2B26FFAE6D6BAEEDBA0C6F4D34F5F82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x86ADC75EC1ED598D81C1243EC7D099CE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x1297C511476CC18FB604A3382C9F3E15
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0xEDA54B2F8E27DCA1F53CEA30EBC349F5
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x067EEB16526F8FDDF7EAA0D7A81413C1
whispered--
0x9D56165790DB3F8408FCAE65C7B49B58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x3FDF24D5E1B2A9824702EFE098638B5F
quilt."
0xA0EBF9FF9F1BC371EA49BB0F2E75FC55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0x54DC10256863026B592CA3B9ED0EEFA4
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0xB20FA1C64EEA4B943DBDF08FD56FD0FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0x981E28F5FE841DCB13E85381EA252D37
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x0B878335D49982AD93A3AEB889036A2D
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x461EE4FB975A2E02FF6D6777F892C492
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0xD9B14F5F64601A68094538D335D57091
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0x740161B8641195401305152BC5B32AB8
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x8F613689980B31842344C9A42D8A5D47
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xE07A558F7E7E94F4DB41235C3BC1A18B
been continually at fault."
0x268C72078FFD729A26588304388478E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xEB124C2B32B4D4AB4ABA51C49004AEAC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0xDF4EBED417F2ECE18E7EC1DF2ABABABE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0x4CFA01E831F738F01CF7E4D42CAE6156

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0x8095C73E22FC8ACEAC6C7CBC746B5363
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0x865B736DCD311AE2B982CD3DA270A578
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x4D180EE08DAE80E383DC9A2F7D66078D
reveal Him to me."
0x54A289E8AF29C7D4EB305BF93EA6A009

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xB04408AD8DB6003F5715614748A0C22F
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0xC6555BBAEC890181A311D02DD6EAF6FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0x4626B99B24EECCA1FF0B037B1115AF1B
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0x517EC5BD2998E199B07A7C24A4E6E63F
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0x1CAF4A12EF811891D1B38DCA3BAE5D74

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0xD0160CF1020BC94DA01552DD643FE279

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x2C5AF473C6E9474F883546CB3B0868D8
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x44D102EC4E1ACAAA3B0D2FC53110B302

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x422C10C535D162B873C64E9AD29B80F8
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0xFAB6C7BA5EFA5160AEB52051D1413A6D
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x7A337129B5FDD82B88AC3A8112418549
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0x789C1D8B4703345681D198084BA6EE0F
tone--
0xE4FF709AA83E1735F2A35DC467DD84D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xC19A34A97C4E25D0982EAB78E71C75F3
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0xBD853EA1D1FD16ECE79CF4120DFC2C33
near me."
0xAA0AEAC7C502D12E94C39746DC1B8583

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0xF445EED8831A39BE9BC6DFD5B2649B24

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you warm, darling?"
0xA73CEB851C6814A76D6A2FA8EF86C496

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night, Jane."
0xC6A417C1229C632D4818FB8B6C435F86

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night, Helen."
0x051BDB54A0378F368D651017EE1EE557

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xCDD44EB693D7CA604F1F87627B459341

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x88058FE4E52B3E050D7BFB7C43E99FE0
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x14464F908AEE090BE41621F003F9B70B
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0xF2956A95482A6CA7BCCDD34F9A7542BD
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0x69B6ACE789BEC321F43FA7673EDB049A
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x2AA65F84C8436C36EA5F2CBA3FA6E515
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x16A5BE89C87755EC06F5FB7849A9F04D
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0xBF81F00EAFC7DAAE086D4F684D6589F3
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xF07E01F3BBD4E89EA50BEA347DC11E85

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0x7A17A2DCD2F51ECD13A97C8C597FC63B
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0xD60F541F51A7C751EF9EEB5B53847FF1
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
0x9457BF813704ED8B79EBCD4AF1DD1715

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

CHAPTER X
0xA7C2951E1BA5E2B5F81542CBAE1A82F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x11BDEE9018959784B042181303864437
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x71B16264C2A9335E10ADB32358E16766
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x623644F8CAC9B95A28E98794AA2522F9
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0xA21617375973DCDF56DA6C27FBE7D528
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0xF9DF8BD92312194DADC73A7EEEABA839
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x2A7AB8D2C7FFD0709BC44EB965B813ED
connection.
0x25A5D1BC1AAB1AE0F114959FEEDC8994

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xBAE14B44A845D73AADF2CE489209EFB3
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0xC6B4EF36C62EEB55FA3DB78F44CBEC05
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0xABBACC491846ECCB6BC4DE3C5EC82EDA
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x0C4C10AD251850C71B5092DB5A716BDD
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0xD325737EABDB9D98D804E96780AF58EF
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x35F5F89FAE3524494CCCF9DA986BFD51
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x33BD3605A79840DC5113E87F3192525E
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x3138BC9A84EACABE883DEB531EF28CB6
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xB225FCF7A3B2CE2BEE4249C7688D176E
beneficial to the institution.
0x54E0FB32659CA2328592E4BC085FD16D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0x942E4A57D560E6939087C932BCFD5919
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x8C4FD94DAE108428949F0F7B11309883
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x34D177F352B4F54C9C2764672D0ACE35
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xCBF3C6098FB4E9619AA16CC5DB6B2417
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0x19AAE540FBD6422C82CBDD6DFADA6C31
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0xC7546ACA143CAD8B4419015B0B02652A
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xD10DAC61D9A8F15D482E47AE98A5A540
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xD7313D7B5D6BBDC87DE7D47A5A41B1CD
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x3670D782B36181E8EFA67BBCB2FB4F5E
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x714721E1AD0E96EEFBBF5F4408913D56
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x6143DC1D91CEE05D7BE045F006DFF9AC
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0x3FD1FFC20D18698FF41DAD1EA2ED3DD6
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0xAB985483954BD11EEDEF7FE7820B3A7A
testimony to its value and importance.
0x9EE58810BCCC81E065A27E709A795734

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xF09C48B5D2819D3755541E314A3157C2
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x1E67A6760DC7DC5150AE754A1FE632F6
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xADE00CA2D3A3087714A761CDCC1A6FC4
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x014FE7DC55F9CF254FA8123F6743FA36
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x3DF5FABFA7CB4F3A54344B7F9D92CE6C
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x37702DBA50B39F3BAD94AD97C5D4DD88
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0xA5E49AD0EBABD28E53E911B6ED580BCE
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.

Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x3D06C945CFE1390580B4685CC131B369
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x1A8C0E88A7FD2A5B46F2B22D32605219
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0xA815441EF5E70B32E8D2FDFF0F350155
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0x1A5B5118CEA73E6F7E90F4DBE6FC168C
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x1FE5771432D6CDA6B5BDBF2E95D4E4CD
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x16599E05740FE7023F474AD5D613BDE1
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0x7EABF5D9B126E6668C82102704FD0985

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x4EC7860BB8E52115C3E44860D04918F6
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0xC6D89E1046D22ACAD8C4D4314B93D873
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x7873EBE336C41AE74B141F3648BDB8A2
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0xED4AD3C42D173AF7A3F9AF0C08DC431F
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xFD165E899A46F73C99CFB8DE0B4B7CA2
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x739EF2E6370DD82BCD4FCEDFCB2FF89A
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0xBB01CA2E01DF53813EE5E5B7AD7555C3
character.
0x3C01E94E4224AEAF57A86D9AD026BD3D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x25711230F3CFEFA080927F0BDFBCBB78
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x09640B9CA981E2E052D5BC7DDB367721
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x6B98237DE96785A40871527E566B0E72
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xA37D965F9C33403938E90F2C49DD50D8
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0x67AE1E344938DCA12E183D367EA7862C
of the occasion.
0x21ED7BD9613FFA5C1202B26FB3436DC2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0x11BFCACC30EFC599610598E85C3A0C65
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x5E610D4E6EBC7B725B157EAD6027C05E
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x547E799815914BCE641EE14C561DCA50
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xEB188753D026713CB9894336B2C8F4B9
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0xC2E70742CBA52C182DB26AA6A1E6A4CF
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x579EE826961434EDEBCFCF7156E61B1B
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x3BD8B3A3DD98BBB8A95CF4990A8C4242
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x79515BAFF0404D6B87CD74B856E630D6
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x3F3A5A3FD58DF6243875C2E85D212821
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0xF76983C8A110C41A30285910D164D07D
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0x28D9CDF9032FA4A02266C17AA6FFA363
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0x302A8AEFCD6A8DA93092386CFBA7CE05
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x7EBA13033391B9E116B7D8AF710C458D
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0xD9C640BC2996BD12BF8414D686013E45
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x48B3928F89133E0A435D9934B75E6C9C
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x04288ED64330578EDDB51491D55577F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xEB936FADD6541F85D4F45A237F69EB6E
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0x5D67B99160E3AA553643874AC2CC0C6F
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x71ADA621E0024089502144A021C7B575
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0xB53575FEED8B172FB17446497E43C1D4
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0xA62D37F3C1082C2BF7FE068B3F50170D
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x043EC4681CF33F32714774E261BA3848
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x8858ABDDDA0222B840C73A24A64EDCA2
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x7E95FB90683A6521D3FF6AA6E38E99D0
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x486B823686B9592DE0E13D7545C9EC4A
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0x2F1E941B6EDB60121CE32FAE66BAF81E
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xCCA8DBE29A5D3A420EE2D07E88C1DF73
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0xC6CCFE14104521FE8472578E55105185
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0x54C7E84FC867CCB083EEC754189D785F
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0x1F94D27938F98643B54C6795AEC56DBE
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x34F87B4741302847814FF910589217E9
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x1A8B187BEF5493BE7009127E1A6492B2
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0xC6AD6B99E94DEFF0C9BC4B54CAB5396E
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x6AE0C4AB3F45F48544F3F56B60FADF4E
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0x49DED34E80EDA62A2CC9D7343142C5DA
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x50986218C7E9B6BF2D6653EB0A18E9DB
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x5808F15D1461A65562779AB7EEE7BD0D
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0x733D32C973CA20AD709407683D4886B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0xC644A91CBB7BD5C6DA50B5B3B48151A9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x20E4D2ACF4C9D0B0FBA83CEB61FBA29E
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0xA9F8C499841A9A5D66F47ADF6E13CF31
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x9236061F58872502E33E613C5679474F
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x9BA99DE8E8DFB503599635EA172C81D5
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x9A3E00BA536C4058D44B1684FD998AAD
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x510CA5A872A139A59D68BFE9666B5A73

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0xED50168018CEDCC0AEAAE5D9EC99C7C3
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x863D83A42DD00663E3317702BC4A28C0
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x2AE138FEA1D48A3F0AEB3DD2317DAABB
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0x39B7670E69C16BF9C766077FCF36273C
instantly revived.
0xDC229C54BFEE31CF110173092AA0536A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0xA30150DC470AEF9487EB1A12ECD6D03A
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0xD625ED68E4B6A0E12DD6EAA3688F8B2F
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0xC7F2654547505CC56E2D3537D789EA63
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0xC623DD482FCD0E769405CC6085515541
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x49D9D3744033000BE3249C7140BC1347
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x5A1320064C140ED2569A93E66E3B60A4
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xCA62896F14FA6AF92BDC8BDA028F8274
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0xA8FB12F5F22672FC5B10C58F842D218D
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x928D8AA1CD0B90FB25B5A2EC755F05A1
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xD3729791873565A3B2154D710E62BD7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x12A2B04740187F78EBDB77DDF2FAD610
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0x2221BF98E2C5BB1035D725B2077F9656
think_ again with all my might.
0xB5C2BAA704F6F52FE53F37C875615FAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x7352D5C1BF02A98D57200398BB474266
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x35F8F9A724F00634D18E429947FB68AE
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x6663C85195FCCDEDE38695EAFB273E67
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x7BB38EBFEEB585CE82999B7554F5837E
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0xCAB1A2F72C38182E383C00337D89179D
their resource?"
0x938EE10BD9C24A7A0131395818430EA9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0x58027E5E4A464F949A1B2F0EE19C75F6
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x503754C7EA656A4A14648361671858E9
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x7FA8E09D1544E355AB80C43F3A55CD13
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0x75106185E95F0C3088F0ADD589B70876
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0xA939914D27B2B684EA8E87574C2A7802
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0xFA170E91EA5FC9F35E9D5D8FBF9B7E69

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x78B9D17E95094E3CB7B1756E9AB37316
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0x53CFEBD2FB1F9BCFD57AF74023FF2FB3
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0xD7E76A68703AD2FFCF04FDC9E739DBCF
_---shire Herald_."
0xAA7BB5C89178013BA5276E65A2A8EAE2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0xEA886EFE2D8F09A1F8CE2E6E29C0A119

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
0xF14C051C4FC09AB5EE363579E1893E53

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0xF90745F18280B3237CEF4BA5BD693E30
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0x3658E558D123331DCA0A467B2A2FB2EA
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0xB568D658002931ECFB9343BCEFA47B41
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0x28466CAE60EF345364662E616307C889
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
0x9FF3117DED9F5F4E75838997D073EDBB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x200EDD4CBD5A8A4EFEDA1EFF001ACEDA
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0xC13D752848728A0E5E16BBCEE4A57971

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x83E25A189A6F8E091D00DEA115DB3E36
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0xB0891F6641EBB76522EECC72410FE3CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x07BB0DD0F8E1D532BEFDD87A6C2E046C
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x412105D3EC2A0162494781C6C9BF9FF3
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0x1456596D538994D69936581B7781B9FB
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0xB52C0788D1EA1B34B55A10E70BB76017
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xC8CC912EB1BA9CAA4E228340D5632504
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xFCEDBE88056E15B156D397854724AA24
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x677CCB8C4D43102441CF15C7CB8D0917
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---

0xAF43B0B503FFD1CCEE2DE607F4802F6C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x40739392B6C16972BEC6B6749468E1E8
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x58DD8E6194D63D7BF3E36AE37DB52814
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x013432A561035AB56F78EA4F6899D244
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x811B116239364D1C6951E8FA9C2D0261
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x8E4271C4395EBE380D271169BFBCDF02
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0xB6A5424A19960A4C310040D020891BD5
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x9603B40E2018C0FC5E9542AE9397D701

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0xB92CAB40A4346201CD7C431142D015CA
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x2B3289A23F628A5C8527A5CDC35DC943
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0xD9D342EE2CFBB781BB26C64BC09601F9
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x2918F06CFC699C6CE9C35CD3AE810AD7
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0x84978DBFBE2FA8D1607F31AB38C8E6E0
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0x049FCA64FE7D5FD1B98B3516A9FB6C6B
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x6AB14456479603BD9FCC0C6B52E22FA9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x7DA80F4A3F735B95E918E6B4D5955855
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x1310E8A2D883F9BCA875997B98230824
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x41C4A97E74539782925A5942BBEE25B9
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xE955A4ACEA630F44F4842EC9F6810CCB
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0x6D94931CC3992C5856858EF63D1D0D25

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x5AFBC3097C448C26EFF09CA583BE8909

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0xDCB9E5A7C4A5A56218E744E0D8D9D7BC
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0xA03B22D7D5FA755A5716A62DF7110F2A
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x71BC9775A1D17A631799123F457D370C
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x99891AC87A45622C46D1225F79475610

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there only one?" I demanded.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0xDA17BC06BB3678C4C17054ABA322B4DA
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x9E225093C2ED1F9083B4A4AFB621C2E3
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0xB40B832636C991E7C689CFCB05394BBD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0x50A9CEB1C188F755109A13F569B91890
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0xDE7338386F88A846A99B69135AB8E2A4
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x2700296C42BCF06F15EAFCBF8D40D988
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x4424EDD60D99921AC2694CB70F211DDE
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0xA3597579B6E0B028674A4FF336469519
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x6B435719F9D04162C7A0E34C73D70459
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x4AE9BFE75CC09D2F5169A8D775BD978F
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x2B79D14FD6DF7E6CCDEB2810EE71EFBD
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x3788BFEA7B531A7C2A7642192A3B76E2
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x2E2D84C3EDEB92D2C82C5E831D9BA067

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,

satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0xA4375AE9207E705404730DBE3F3275DB
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten

"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0x4C9A5390FE49FACE64389A3B56B2D739

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x6F4BBCBE2607AC7C038186CD2831305A
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x6BCC6CD150A98FE8294ABC2839FE9C8B
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x26F3E35E784F1E805E3C7E4EB55C538B
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x01C344B9A5B615F139C7C22F7915961A
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0xB89154F72B73B5FE048EFC61D14EB3E4
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x8A3BA6EC31B92BE3B824C98150B69188
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0x828EDA0B9ECDAFB75E8D6BF7B90A207C
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xE8435DC3A58851059C3CE0391FA9EEA4
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x2B0136D7C661E190E4DEFCB1A7B76C31
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x601F86E8A6624195EC0CCADC814BECD4
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x50CC7E12BE14C135F5CE4BC1DF38B2CF
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x0FF94EE3340EF340EEA00110F8E806E7
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x721E452F5984FCD6B269B6BA839AFC59
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x8641E411E0975E37E907F8F29165E9F6
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x54AF36C9954D8F0C24899551B21BC39B
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xE80FA0319E031FFC1C065E7F5EE10F5A
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0x5B679EA5FFD2E5C7FC59C7A4462CF7E2
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0xBECBFC639C9005F750424CD4A60EE242
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xA769E46A2DBA5FD1090FE883DC238907
probably, be a good way from the town."
0xC85F50C78FD846BE007E44B6A3D4D034

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0x12E3CA6BB5896F191B69CC115C77DB97

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x0982C32A5B096B4F87DFF2BE262CC3A8
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x209416F9FA50B116777146E229476C66
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0xD137FF65857EC7533EF0235B3CD8AFC4
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xFE1056A22E6AC30DA63C5D6DCC70C00E
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x2AD5018B8166DF0A455CCB360140966C
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0xC4F7CDECBFACE6CBC89489521EA3E10B
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x36EF6951DCE0D8E36D0B095113CC742E
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x8D5384CFD420D3CACB6CB9BBC92DE640
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x9899947D8370ECBA2005D204652D34C7
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x0B9A6FD0D0D8C3B16B15A0D918087ABA
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0xA5844A3FFAF059D5492671408AB0E342
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0xDBE262FB5566C03095CB4C70FB7E7F9A
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x5A22CF700CB7A2C8A562B667842B3FE4
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x491EF9AD892811BA06D712634DD74822
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xDE812B6D35A05A99E52B9CB2069777A3
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0xD8971FA68E843FFFDDD5A103D6E03E46
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x4D1C45777B4B369E077191D82A5E3DC6
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xB31EE466DED06A2D8236B7DF673B6379
forthwith be furnished me.
0xF2E847DCD5A5CA8239D186909E31EA00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x3BAAD1D1B56A045AFF43E248BFB18BEA
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0xD7BC3F7B9B4F286247C2E2174487FFD4
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x8103F13EE305AA02001F42C0FD1EC95F
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0xBCEA34F325FCAD1B1B08535A06CFA9DB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0xE24910F244FF0399B7E325632EF1A9E4
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0xD80FB55FC05FBB9AA27AC1267295AA2A
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0xE125E0705EB24BB9F631ADC111C65F86
years ago from Gateshead.
0xAE25405208F9D5B491D419F9E4FD90CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x100A521381CA10CB330EB2F58148A2CF
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xFBB39422BD0375D9C083E7A519F4D988
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x5A50974FB916C2515717A9A02FEBB3CC
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x98EB03DCFA135C1D71CF7D710206D934
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0xB3844CFDB4062316041C84E211E617C5
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0x7C6C1AF144B0C4FBC87734B62202BE86
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0x25FF600117A03AE5063CAB4A0EF8BA38
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0x044DF9C9217A78688816098028D063AA
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0x544650E04DBA6DC8BB6AA1D450AE3E5D
while the change was being accomplished.
0x31FA283E9658CD03E9C2ADA071BF2178

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x3C0EF98C13C15A92F45CE8907939D24E
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x1391D392986311960A5D9660203A7222

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xF9FC33ACCF51665FCD3F9F566FCBB088
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0x2ADB84B474381D8E64ECE36CAE34D9F3
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x87E04991D257C74DAAC9B8554762FA57

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x853074208A53136BE5FEBB2A61F5253D
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xEC0AB0AB9708CEE374045025FD957866

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x1D9247B93A8D0DD54EA54759BCE958BA
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0xD96F069B766ADEE7B48DFB52197E5031
complexion.
0xA582357B48C169FF55E01A2308EC4CEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0xD3A5A268A5FD1377A5CB80B6FDCD69DA
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x86A1A47EE514017DEB96A2FFAE975FDE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0xEB65DE8E50998E3108ED18D0CC96EF70
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0xA8B9C36E98D34503741F2593D07E9053
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0xE977420A1DCB8DF08F76515C0EC8A3A9
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x9B1C889A2712749A9870C55853BA55CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0xC0A3DCB405E58BB2585CD32DA2492CE1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x5016F50D786B199BF9B9D3D5D2EA0BA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0xC56D3810B29B347391A19831C941D823
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0xB54FB45F3501E8C148E062175084A91F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x3D6BB24F6AC88826045338C35EA1C94E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x276994B7886423798961620412E3C9E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0xE20119C5B7F531B6B8EF5DAD3C9165D3
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x54EFF5178A5A14C87B79C79103AC1386
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0x3AC659F4977A6E95F42654154DE840A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x74B73795A568CB2F6BCD51FA217207DB
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x35005F71DE8E8BAE7912D0F09CBE33C2
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0x97B210739C3631EFCD06DE1A053431DF
would make two of you in breadth."
0x612A7396C58FE2261863C2C453BACA99

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xAE51E33DB08C23C551CCBE4190B9D65D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x3588B457C2BC4B1B3E15C9403A025C1E
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0x5E96A8F2CC175A06BC64BC37E9B6775D
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0xEF34C1EDFCBD9080B9CAD8E53DE23879
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x1246186C05CB6F2A54E1DA85239FB60F
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x00EA817C8FB3D92DFFCF560270C22481
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xB0962B2B657561DDA4873DCF07C8C841
quarrelling--"
0x21D630D630115EB6AAB6ACDF24474309

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x076849BC7914383A2249500447B0F2E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xC05227EEC4F9CA3C7B9766559B3E0993
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x5BB86C802D72EB1B79038D941EAB207C
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x4A8832E9E9F92170DD8F624563DC67F0
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0xB016C67E28AC92363F6BB505AFB5B0FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What does he look like?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x383DF56E3876BAE372463B7F26417FD0
has such thick lips."
0x3EB4EAFCAA72CC05A2E4262CDD44D1AF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x722BFEE4BE714DE9B12125BBE7FEF5BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0xB85A2D366FDEEFA152DF42F834659631
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x63F53A3EC83C01404C6018EB090E512A
a deal of money."
0x1840A4DB4671F57736C1834DC59C678D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0xBADFAB7784636B622E67046B136FC701

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x237AC6EFF8584DF1CE31AA191E245B93
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0x122435F9D1F1099DCE70D197F3F13111
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0x7C755474FF34E9114FCDD5ED1CD3EA5C
you were quite out of my reach."
0x71E16A4C042D7AF4C20D8119C8400BFD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x3AC59D894957D9195EC8A98B86520432
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xD2060899ACF8B79540A0F0ABCC493F88
shape denote admiration.
0x6C0FA350941183EC49F270728AC65388

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x7FF22C254FC2B342B7385935C46847DF
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x8BA343D89BC8F1E87B00F1C170251250
a child."
0x43F40DF441D090399D1C90E678B159E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x87EBECB3128409C4B577877D10FFFB3D
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x1AE12DEFBDEA2D951E490BAB95DDB51E
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0xA170B609DDD5FD20D0ECA8FC4717AF8D
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x5D51C9F75A689ECE7E335267C6CC1597

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x18134001DCC25C68377BE6813C2E045B
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x8FE3B535363B9C0444B5040B0394F449

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A little."
0xEA46D5C3C1888C2F5CA759A42E6C0A67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xFADF9692F9FE4B40BB55C16790A10C97
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x1517E16B2E2B68B16D87CF09DAB338B6
charmed.
0x5F7E2B73699713BEA472BC16DA03F469

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x7306CF18038F95413634EB72AD0A7D4F
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x19C98FD7A075C92AFBBD8962F02A414F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xB74B11F7C616A3955FCC00AF4AA1B680
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xDAE343997864C362399EA44069AFAF54
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x4E7D9A1A00D7F31432E49A699967C257
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x39E64DA47734454B65067D6599E9631C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x75E9DC58E768895A3B63CA64673C36B1
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0xBB2EAD0AC0DBCB92834258B6E0B272E5
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x8710CFA4B80BC211BBCCA040B55FA8BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x6A9A2ABE29C7FCE8B245CA833C1C6BCB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x245B8C3667A685659D781CC95626BCEB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I can."
0x45BE586F47B65586D6FA7C625BCDB905

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0x55AC28608F6BC0F4CBC653F086F26188
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0xDBACC61E3CBA6F6FC0065FEA58D54CA5
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x13AD41D3A25AE5B08901E43A53F41D78
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0xC03AF65B9FD18132279EBF85E3FA5BD5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never in my life."
0x5898FFF98E36903CDD179F0CADF1C793

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x36A5A98358202D13930ACB32E236A2CF
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0xFC021520167FCAE5D619B129EF85BED3
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x3CF13CE4DC2B979985DF6313F57EDC32
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xE6F3B41EC12DBEFDEBF81DDC4B3FDDAB
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x0D6D8EC5B0C80CE10FDEAFDC3FDB4260
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0x648E2D48534DFE99EE71B2C73FA25D14
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x584765A5023013A7AA5658F638B352DD
father's brother."
0xD824C8CB42DC6112AEDD4681B272D99F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x5DD9D6BD6F38FEDE2477E2ADB094784A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x5C9BECA4E4F979B6B3CA4D675D2E35F2
tell me--"
0x46EEBCFEE32A54C2A6BCF7D00F5E1D64

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x8D95C41EACC0438382DA5E1CF0438F18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0xD8C85CCC6E4DC6DDA29AD17FC57B1179

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"So he went?"
0x0A2B8BBE76B9AB76A1083E0A25B846A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0x760CED32DEED01CDA2B8152AAA4688C2
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x1D424DA0EDF88AC66C8977D6B703372C
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0xE553938350AC6EE1ED03FBEB2B417620

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0xB80BB5CC79D47F857C0387AD502F4424
wine-merchant."
0x115E702353F3CAE38AF161B1F9171B6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x2539411148E2918C2AEBD513C9DF0005
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xB3AEC9DA6BD472087BD0CD5FB50433D4
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x908635D8E377311889916068C788F5D2
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xCAB7D031929322C7354FA4A046757CB7
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0xE9833D8E425D8BE78B4CB4D6CD6E0340
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x0447F024090808ECF8387052F9ED3838
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XI
0xBE00406D9EDD8C4E44229DF202CA9BEB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x140A8D85DF7D2AAC509D79EF2B329DA4
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x667C9A226359A06F207A049A25986A96
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x9D2722B17F5B2888E05AED1B8383E8C0
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x1EED5956E095527532666F83E05B4BF1
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x9B684D187E463048CA4B956C10DCC571
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x9F980C21EAC317617A27A05516AF823C
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0xC72CB9A2830FA653CEB1F06C515269C0
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xACD4A7AB8AC507A2FE8BBB3470C7E43D
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xEF7464E634E2A712298F900B090BDD7A
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x4D0DF32651405FCEE557DBB0C562F2BB
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xCF4826D224B79EE9C73479A03707204A
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0xA9777FCBC48DB93B69D6044CB65F0FE7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xAAD115E43CD47504FDD62325BE088355
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x5E961FDF3B6E04A71EE17E2BD2BDAA45
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x1846F55C5CCCF8214A8225DC0FA569B5
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0xDAA478A262417B936CA25B262ED40AAF
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0xD6C50C9EBCDA08A645A0E6341AC4CB55
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0xFF8F031BE33A6C7E3A2432651E175510
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x952AE4D39AD60A86074853BF301D163B
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0xD59AAE6AB52A6134D05A7B6A343B8315
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0x4B1DB2B2DC6DB13871540C0A6F95EEBC
troubling my thoughts.
0x67C9987ABD3C800C7CC33AC8F5443C3D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0xA93C4C8B03B9069F421384EE522FCCD9
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0xFC21ACE5ACA8C2365D124F5479E09ED8
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x318B9DB79338E6817AE9733B7905CEE6
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0x6D17AA42399152B7DB3E4F9EB5688525
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x4ABE0BF6A5347E896EA059E92F107A06
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x0A0E33A336A3988632B85091138E885E
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0xC907C634DCFF5C12C34D1361A6DD7FBC
the bell.
0xE120BE8404661CDDD5812213F59BA607

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0x95FDFAD432094C85D016D92F0DEE3254
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x24E18CDBCA01ACCD7CA3A0D6E2CCFCEB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x16AA492786383B0C1D92DFA7F16B07AF
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x4CCBB09B4F3A25012D498BCE02F8D69B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0xAE7D41AEFAD73F859164B50500B2D8EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Person here waiting for you."
0x1A3BB6F393D63F0E861D4FB5F1B27AA0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x230DFB8DD1DBFF3F3B3D6B81A8BB348C
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x9C3FA7A9316FB9984D6EBF8A11942309
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0xEDFB01F29C5D8EBF5F6351444358336A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x99D752E4E2C766CD8AD4161BE806E0C0
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x61FA019807DC63E754E3A28B8D41E060

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0xDA7396EBE74DD626A11339DD96581CFD
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0x7FF5DB4EDE67E22EE7C3E6E5B3686F6F
Thornfield.
0x6D208C72B11A5989306C8466C1ED3D1D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A matter of six miles."
0x63524A578CDE9F6FBF8A06D88E5FB4E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0x6B25542660E1FABCD413440A36DB5B29

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Happen an hour and a half."
0xF63897AACBDA8472B10E0C71E84180D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0xFB394CC67AD61A0A67EA3C5B4C82C0F2
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x375D2A19F2B991B9965C3F5DC150C7B6
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xD5E206603764C6A818F45C8808660BEF
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0x14151D2538BE4AF71235436A0279929E
much at my ease.
0xE4FD780A74B01B7C8E62BBF43E352D17

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x345D0A31BCCC61549DBD6587FBDDA8BD
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xDF6A859BFB907A9B29674A99C66D671F
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0xF4246194400520A2AD57B387D057DA3C
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x83729AFCDB581DF714F878D6A0D10191
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0x5033ED3B403B0F35FE2CFBC8732031BC
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x34C395BB6BE4FEDC6C2D0CA3176EDC59
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0x9FBFB273DDB6CAB500EB7608C7924818
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0x62D48CBCA3107FB91E53CF6FA861BEFD
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x8CD394F054A457762269BC6D74161BC6
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0xC0552E1C3736F99FEA722860427A7EBA
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x949658632B0A875AB923ACE4CF525F0B
road now, I wonder?"
0x45C914A9CA1A05F6AC02FAF7D3ECEB86

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x3C4BC75EFF9789B6656068418D2923F2
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x180706C4BE65851D51107FB9A1E033E4
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x82AA77E233557E1EC0666DBD65933EEE
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0xCBE3A417C3F26773978C16AA5E5CA876
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x3ACD39AEEBE7608B95BAA136BFA87FBD
more stirring, less romantic.
0xFD62D482A6504BF14F4F6FB7D832F2CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x0028CAA52DBAE66DB906EDE0186F3CBD
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x1CA0DCFA8E97D60E95018E0C56D73DF8
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x46E7756DE1EDE43794F61E087B24B6F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x7A2891962368936D9225F53E0A49CC13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x89A9D7E584352E1F035D105B5A48E84D
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x7BB917A86EB7DBD01651C25C701EA5B2
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x1999E9510156F8C13640CD69BC8BD6BC
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0xA67C9129AEFF68B79D4838759878A9D3
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x48CBFB61A65A65C874329A533C5EC0A9
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x051BD84D7EF18C7EDC968FE5A3E658E7
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x7DB140A7B11CF0499CBB3DFC6B5AC81B
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x85CDD53A73DB25760DBA0ED279C98222

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x1695F74EA2AC3EF4E31140F2E37FD40A
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x0C46DE318719C75175958DE478B1F414
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x87FE578D389C99DBC136094A587FB188
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x34C223D984DD953495EB8490DE227615
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x991F3DE520225F19791CB1360317BD73
itself to my view.
0xFE924E7F0E7489B960CB4278C392AAA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x8489F6033DEF3F5F2FE4D2A0ADC3848A
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0x403E7165E3335B883A2C404BFDC9E1B3
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xF5860BA549E84928C8BE95C767E3ED2B
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0xCE356A4BEA56EF20FF7BBAF4FDD3510A
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0xAD5DB5BBF617E0EBDB2337D5EFEADE3D
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x3AD9F5DDD5DDCF79F10DD1FA3A802F6F
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0xE848C87BDE319DFD4F24613F3AC30061
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0x842587E1166712288E9DB31296BC4D39
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0xDF24DFE656F27BD0FBCB6167E5BA3150
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0x8A7025E19CF7EA07C1888436B5138A1D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0x24952B0A18C9C22D9ADB3022B675B9FF
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0xC9D01462FE864D047C4E9B78A4160640

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x3DF31238B982568C4FB364C2525BEBD0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0xFD27BFCAF6228E547AE86FBF6104B5ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0xF8E8F1BB21B8AC20B6D0A85618FD22B9
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x49CF6688059AA02D0F6AF1B0273462FB
trouble.
0x11A8906BAC2589E16CCB69FB62783947

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x0C15F01BD6841750942FF64105EF6F70
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0xC8B5D48293B0C35EFBBB316FEF783406
the keys of the storeroom."
0xBC46D98CA041FBC034FDB7DE2A4D5206

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x086171DD7F342663518855AD39F4F5FE
delivered them to the servant.
0xD965AB1EBD14EA85E659E4DC3A2A2ECF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x79157D9631DD6AEA43D6E75F54570233
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0xEC4AFDD02542D55E79A8A3C3FFF53A34

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, ma'am."
0x2879D498485C98754F956C19D1F129E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0xA6264EA3241868C08C6BF7741A383EAB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0x31571FD43B5D34811855D4AEAB166A49
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x89094411F19C43630E30CDB8D41FAAB4
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x082D7D1AFAB3854A67D4FDB48F032E86
too soon."
0x4F39364DCA2344C9DD7D8B0DA73AC56A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0x7C85FDCD92B81EB8734FDF7F487538F8
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x9841E712812A7E45A3067F365298DFFB
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x8B6CCBEBF85CC72F1C7BC992C65D238A
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xAD7A25C7ACA199498F8C074ADF948561
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0xBEE53ADC7AD066871E2BC24707357F52
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x44035666D92E3D80E8FF71ECF7029FF8
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0x48CFF2767124E35168AD4A8E07D7F62A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x30D92D05FD13B3B57085D67A45F1F2C5
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x9D221C2D2F5AA0141277899FF88B9B06

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xB5D931663D762BCA17908E3F756E3215
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x6657EA87E7A8E18B8D71ED184AC589F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x7BC3500F117FCCF31EA8FC3A40BC7914

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x03171D91BB32F2D92C5E266CCCC3A958
future pupil."
0xA7A581B0A1D4845D9200A35663F5268B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xD32E3D93FA0C0DBC74317A9509B4A26B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No,--I have no family."
0xAFB265DFDC8430A267A2F1EDDBED5030

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x75FEC24262A3C9518216FF9B0934CE46
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x795EC9252416487B4DFAB3DD3B28855E
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x053C73EEE8C73EF8D1DDDFB1E39A3FED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0xBFA7AECAB469559BFAB5413A09FF1643
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0x23A94E43C15B7617F2F1AAADFFE84DFB
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x6DFC2B035EA4853617AB6D6360A039A6
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x57B98784859DC6E60EAC13D23F0B4F1B
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0xCA1612E689CF22D1760358EE08387576
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x2A40D8A77F281864B7C7B032022C7E44
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0xDC4B1CE23C5FD8B485BD5E96BF1FF46E
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xC02799A2481AE0302D0F2C3C04D61055
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x9F4AE8449E6EC24C70951F2B69C87FCB
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0xA811445B055D1ED7722DC61E13BDA87D
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0xADEB7B7CCC02CC81390B2826284827CE
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x19741D8F2C86AA5711BB84136257127A
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0x45890EAC18B2F3A51F76706B53766B1E
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x81FE92A0B522F0066B4A4B2CDC41A681
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0x17EB7AC36428F7E3EAE2B4913E48FD83
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0xE70C86292AAC3331A463238A49FD2DE7
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x0F45995EB1E610767846FEE8F9A3429C
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0xFE6F55BE375BC750223385B6BEEE8A13
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0x37E43539D0AC0E9371277F7FE73DEC00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x96D0AEB186CA81480A0CE5BD2BE7EB39
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x7F36B514E235B85AA6E06A7601596FD7
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xD159E2FD5B9CC5CFB5A4C678427CFA8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x8D558EFE240DDCEAC375EB72F1CD646C
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x1BDBAC4B2A6694D38B7816A6FE80C394
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xC38A02DE0D7F89E32652AF2C94D8EE93
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x2D8A7045104446D84547F78AD692D2EB
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0xCE28F7FF7142EF2D702B1B2C8A5BC0E2
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xA9CDC81DD8232204A5D91E208D6EDC9F
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0x37D1B68126C88F8F3FACE419639427D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x87170D4163E01AA47017A4FFEC2DC673
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0xF01435CE6D93C11484CF30C4D853DEF5
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x7A662411A2F6020E4B92B60C12BC239A
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0x92184F8C5EA47F3B3F08D12BA59E5B52
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x0CB2B7173969A045638448567DFAAEAA
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xFDAAD8EA17637B3716E25D2502AFFC08
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x8C789E3E1CB360DE46576282E4E394EC
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x3459F38C6DB3C1048225900A70B23D7B
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x6E65920202D8FDED2D43DBA3C08369FB
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xD5ED92152608F3CE7AD3E033486D6FBA
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0xCF59D6BBAF671DAEEF2BED6FA0972BCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x630DB433FB636BF91B44276D1ADAFCB9
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x6AE13A06B041BD8FB5BFDD3ED9A4669F
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0x5A0A2B2F081293F7683C486638BEDBB7
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x75C7ABCD39D9B112D247CC2DAF246127
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xFCF98A73C52951779FA2B1ED8E6ADC1C
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0xC1F01F11979FFAEC3AF66DCFBCE602F0
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x4CA8E8309F1CC294578CBF35BF4F8EB5
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x546BC04E094F8DD3905F29412AA33633
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x23029FCBF414141FA1DBC4BC03AE9A81
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xC377E26745C03BB3FC9594E8D26A9C5D
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x6E9FA42094BFC05C1AFCE5054CDBD3D8
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x46199D10AA660C3EEC4B1F09772AB2C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x1D255391F0622D1CE6E1F3D1432358E6
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x6A19DB4F85B9FA9903871D9F4CC2E2E0
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0xD6756955591082FD28BBCFE93747E7B0
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0xFBEB3065E46D6D43B4A7273723F0AE49
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xB28B5D75380F631DA4E0906346246B50
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xE3C3C0AA431B43AEDD512550E475CB17
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x2A9FAC687410D3FDD7B4F17623BB0ADB
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xF384E69815ACBA8E2D07AC8E9D51FF81
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0xDF9A465FD5A9429815C49711A1C246FC
an indefinite future period.
0x8B97346110D00383916A7F6A1C3BD638

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xA1EA23C100C97B5985E1EC795DD9CB30
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xF5EEB4873458985D22BE1EC524B1E3DF
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x5FA03037B13E00CFE8330EBC5F20FB83
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x56F5EAD6FB78AAEEAC0D3ABA7DC24475
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0xC78DDD6BBA9EB11FB305C0EB6A28D380
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0xAFEA2B67B52598566232F827E5DDC414
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xF8E67BAF32D2632D9235DD36B38E8B2D
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x646EC155A1B3A8DC43E6B1DCD5FEBA44
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0x1C41F5C7DB6B552978185D683D0E4279
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xD9A2D132F657116E8F9B9EB7D2808648
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x70CC853A006F5310B4AB2D6C76E9BC92
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x54681B4E2BFB8FF90AD599137AEAB4E3
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x4F360B2125F9660DBB3D8DAC33EB309B
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0x2447823D8D0FA6C523DA26F027507852
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xABDDE07F3C2AE88C82613E81F8418E8A
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0xD0CBFD3AAFD275959E44E01AEE2D5A15
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x31F149E81EE01E19ACCD54220C5CD6A1
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0xACA5DE848827ED27A93050A4BAB20F3D
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0xAA0CA00250C6387B60E2F16F439E44F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xD60F0C2ED5C410415A359D33EE2359F1
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0x966862FBB2A13F143747672537275B86
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x57DE2ECE531296B4F1BDAA031BAC0A68
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x8FB51EEE4E8DCC81D233B6554C9152E4
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xF2283468959D15D1D57A3B707154FA18
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xCD94505AFF5E0D1D00B01C8C7CB5DFEB
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0xFE321C5039A6F8D042E24479758A8589
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x171DD590B0727B0BB33D262B78AD924E
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0x05E1C8DF1075CBB560C4B91F160D8685
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0xC4E35BCCA8B5508E7CD399A3575774C4
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0xC54E819A2DF681CFEBA6B443EA9D4CF5
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0xB9DBAF0D69B6B185A1C4130661B672A4
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x51FC87609255A718B38AE1574FE8B35E
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0xB56D87A44E6BE74F63EC89F4D3D5E7A9
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x7B83ECC10C6231E8A1280D192D663711
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x677F7C3D19ED083993EFB8777CB44E6C
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x2DB80CEEE943E8AE49554C56D12FDEB0
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x0FA111224E9F2607B71D0B615B87A4BB
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0xF172B391108883DD32F52154C462658B
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0xD3EAA3101DFE6603FB1A2F6C4164F463
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xF7CDF26A5F28AC3D0C85811492986549
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x0705470FFF658912C814863AFFFD33DD
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x9051E16621394F365F31F46836E22EEF
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x0848A9DEF11909EC3498C368D3BFE769
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xE0638F2A8C1ED08E5CB2F43DC5B9F433
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x0C9F2A8D9849E99BF1D1CD100011655A
house and gates.
0xDD3A817645158E5398AC3986E73FBA45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0xC91A7C350BCED48A480DD1D8E756D061
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x94EFD5CE16B78F0DC0EFF8D2240E2EE4
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x2419B6CDF0CC0BD87AB42EFBA0FA4A3D
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0x1B45C91656AF007EF800815642FEA4BF
appeared at the door.
0xF31A01F4B3CDF04AB379A1FD97919835

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0xFD680B8943C347387828907945C56661
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0xF523D54D553C267D30F5670912996E7D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x6A2BDB694F5C52E9DBB75444B9CB6D17
much.
0x1C8B32BC37F7B06F71192825CFA08EC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x722A0FA0E1E94C5B3FD041E2FD9514E1
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0x968965C852120BBC798391E76A6D9B13
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0x5F69F85768986B4581249D9229F6283E
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x200C9BCFED7526494F366DB937CC10B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x1949817C024E364B13AE735E32EB8B4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x17C34C2C4AD9BFB3BDA97D96B2AF12B1
was called Rochester?"
0x44DE5ABC876DF9AD4D7EC956399C7B26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0x82EB809D662F0F02CB7F83B03861308D
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x17C80568D2E72CD9A5F25D9AB79C9765
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x3617F2C8180038A00B7B88A0A9A5F40E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0xA41F1FD9C3740AE95B7C6375ED7C802F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0x8A8D4A43E65DDCF335B56F92595FBB52
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0xDEB5CD51CC8BDEC7BAB856E735ED94F4
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0xA0A4C97BB7B47A0590B4F97BEE381662
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x14BE1F44391D88E321E9EA8B61CC5290
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x94D1BB3117F57FFA380FF72914ADDDE4
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x8CD77F94761E855220D5CF4A64D81D4D
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0xFF425AEB2B25E6E15471EED36290D541
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xF2588C81E37B6514284591E7A57045C6
expect nothing more."
0xB61FF774D37850A662DEE345EBD9927A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x1932EBD0DEE18E83929C36E3074C2F65

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x74E4A619E5B0A5A2D5BDE9D72A3EE8C7
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x89AAF1D9D87DA2A4AB1FB14B0423BB5A
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x7E170B9371E22A96BCD70E501E9656A5
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0xC1BED7B2F56A878A56776EE3E1E56744
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xA30D402C1D5E1C81736CD80DA4DB5FA9
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0x175653807C3B6CE8CA680C4D70DD307E
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0xC8260C920D176FC5F0752D5C55951DEE
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x4D29B090B578A8EED43A8F59F7B946DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0xB8C47E07D6D8B641E5C89A43F8EEB7D9
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x4FAB999A14B3B87C591DD8642070A83B
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x0617749058F56B178CFBFC49F9C9B16A
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x80160E5BC906295BD1051D3A5487F907
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x057467B88B462CE7D5007175FC03F06A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x51428BFE008FFC0043AD8EAC6C6A1D2B
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x08E2CF33E85EE379F08478C5229F4DA1
approached.
0x58AF0E111F8F10F3F048F0F372D8216F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x86668717D17E95E739CE906673DE515D
nurse; who answered--
0x589F9D93B8245B5636EB45A7466272FD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x09662977C05FE05711DB406169681977

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xF1578DC2A35B2A01B8165ACA16B13AFD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x5DE85A154B9020E1E3792D16F4604035
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0x87474BB5AF5777A2D57565CB87125CDD
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0xC0BA1F89F1EE5A0EBBF280C2D6A3F334
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x6A00B873E4956BDDE68B2A284EA86C2C
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x33BB6E8E7516163351DC6024EAD09AFC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0xCDDC1B7528E1810ACD1DF34AF72D3771
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x85369DB2660CC3B2A9BD2A6828A54D5D
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x7B82B30816BE17421FE93F517B05E5FF
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0x8DBA448792EA76F84F055215A84C67E7
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x627839A05C726918F506B37B92155379
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0xE8AF4795BC7DEE62D00F15D6462A653A
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x97C005F961D093631D844C298CC951EA
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0xEA983DC67C41DC005B5753DD5423585B
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0xA0CBF0A8B14A5DD922A0FB94C144E2D9
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x6E175B2BB06FB2EB79C3A4E30E082A17
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x3E6637BE1721502323D703549263C09C
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x0CEAE12BE461F4A47D856AE930E031F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x7D4DC57190EF3067DAA726F55DCB25CD
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0xFF3C7B42D3A0B7C9FCABE3E4B1CEBA48
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x69F6DB3F0AFE045AE64C0BCFD63C2DF5
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x7B14C400EE82E80BEBA492C980CE50B0
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x81BC2C6BECDCB2FD95FC08BE4484956B
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x546C21520771F33F631C53A6CD68BE05
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x99BCDB6193D209466ABBBFEFA7670465
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x95046C7DF3913EBAF64DE750B7337EA1
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x9F05C40B28457C74E2E70E330FA6B63F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x465936A6023B0A2E2129AF2ACAACD791

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0x4192416FB5202F5858E0AE7FD00D5FDA
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x45BC2E4CD3C62E09EDECD46C9484437E
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0x292FEC68751810CCE95F6E25A9C42CAB
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xA1107F3DE9BDAB09CD6AF0864C8D07A1
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x4C17C3BF051C1C08675AFE9A701E7F01
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0x06254E33B997D3CC91AEB54924556A4B
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x4582841C7C517C291AA0C943EB5A96CA
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x2E37ABE87549F211B15E2D7F1F6B40DB
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0xE25C58A08BFBA90579405B859C576494
fed with crumbs."
0xBE4176433AC434C01E6E94DBA8C2D2B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x7F7BB9A5DB1CA1D9BB3DB1A64EB614CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x8F1306CFC91BDF16F06145FABEB9CCD7
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x47A1FC5EE527BE4E665577F140575565

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x02D8376ED5E752C0C59458390BF39524
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0xD090785058E832918DDEBC1FBC9981B8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x569C8DDC1C2F1B65BA8ABAE4692F2B28
clean town you spoke of?"
0x5293FC4BCD52F3A8971EDC4F069E186B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0x9F18018EDCF2C75F1349F71693CF62E4
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0x612DBA30FB88ECC9A21781A9D4EB1430
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x5A18A58C2656FE04CA33451CDE3E9DB1
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xA28C7EE6CAA6F50F5694B0405BC0087D
hear me sing now?"
0x2DBA812CD5772A8BB5A99B02CD588252

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x82E5E827E12CD7983AD32C7C90792E12
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x91DF05F0393FEAA1A9484A0CD0B18BB2
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x17FB8494D3AD8847877178B4227F8B9C
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0xA14338ACB885901D3A87C6714818240D
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0xC22D40EE42C721869387C994F5897766
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x9873B418E7FFBC07035CA744F70E9F15
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0xD4B8D07C703E30FC4949BEB92173D165
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0x455DDCF94E469B0DE5A45BFBFEB55DA6
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0x3831C9B82FFF3A1BE6B0085145AABFDA
affected her.
0x2D73067C8F2F024030C16F223F582DDC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0xE1BCAF716C82626B97A892871ABBC593
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0xC0E52442B312F0C9E1CF467FEC5AB013
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x9F040AD1297F94E652466504846FD473
at least I thought so.
0x066BEBDF3B99643911ECA674C58D8B13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0xCCF4C5F33AF6E6CDAF7A075C16BA1891
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x78DB8CB2420A4C9FD02DE45A9FE22800
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0xDB4D5D7EAA4659991F4EC1D6D19F6C35

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xCF1842128BA1AC72BE816866EB525E41
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x7D897857B8A38E63C307EC22538462C5

0x24403924F042F4638BCCB22949FCE852
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0xA765990B6D826F9B981D84541F2F0A85
carefully trained.

"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0x0F07399EADB445ED40D6021943A1197D
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x3F22F3B0A9E24D0FF750ACE502111437
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0x718215A8883AB3718F1DB6105E4CE598

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x2F569B904B71229E5826D7D517A9271F
say, with whom did you live then?"

"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xEA6F66DAD498EBD27B0702ED229FD335
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x211541882EBD0C353EB7F1D2B6CFDFB6
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x89A5452A74BA8A3C60771A361569FBAF
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0xBA140A8D3CA10CD59D5ECAB3D5AF8E83
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x11C0F67EFC254376FCDD017A2379CB53
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xC271CEB4493AC771411DD3B794E9CD36
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x94E0ECDC3C631359BE501DCC9981E12B
and I never see him."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0xCA25ACD9D8E74F8A506AEBE47AD4A78D
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x279ED8CDA611C047198C8DFF25CF16F8
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x2292FC2666F82230689C9E8490A3C9A2
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x89C400D4517B805BAA5908DD73C289D6
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0x7B1ADE0D92EED1529E059952A00D3A81
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x87E95BFA1D4CF152F2059A911011F248
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x91C53F7A3E0A5F0034B6D908897434DC
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0xA39ECF342E971F0EFA28058C436852AF
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x6F6812DDF5077590682381EB9B1B8CF8
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0x6B2B26E2F8CB27BD08609ABFCF04566F
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x44C9E2FCCCAF87319632495F85B35B7C
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x6A9354BDC5FF64EF7974A6062137AE98
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0xBC1B1A29423078FC8F408CEDFF7F58A5
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x547F1578D337B874BF72008123774E4F
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x5DA98228787B62F3D5C78A0DC05B505D
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x06A44320A278F2B5D3A30503161D7482
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x5B15A83524272CCB86F3DD769F15A1CE
use.

As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x9399EF2511C9D63C0018DF9C34F1F349
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xA6DA3002159E70FCE699044E83B1E2B7
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x280EF448DD69873FD56861861F6FCF28
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0xEA5FF7433264BFB980D3F3388FE0BFBF
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0xC54CE57885481CAD41263E3E507C18A5
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x263F40FAC918ED3EC705FFFDCF41221E
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0xF353D8850599FED9BC1A508E596C777C
sideboard.
0xD31B31FF5E7E13414AE6A74245CCF93E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x3F08AD8680CF05F412313AE58C9BAF97
before seen any half so imposing.
0xE5A60665F50EC7328DB304948BD56E71

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x31419E2906A5055B8AD85385589C77C5
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xE248F637B3BEF608027BBDBEF70A9B08
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0xD25F0B66842680D5935D6FE3C12FFCB2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x35B4C7AEA4CE2835ACC2B04F298BA168
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x5620B0646CAF655801A364D2904BA31C
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0xEA524B72DAF3CF22CAA5040BF167D68A
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0xDF525E2F4E5AA62A3CD9DE56426DE5BB
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x687472E6FF72715C2CBBB61B17E6D0C5
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x4E78B8720BD2BA860023AFF4CD022507
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xD6DA143DB64CE80CB1FE6BA07A386302
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x65D04D09007896B66CF6785508F4A18C
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x2DBD19591C3A29BED8371D5EF2392287
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x45A5832460A69E5B9CDF890EB2090950
general blending of snow and fire.
0xA1915D954BD8D5BD41BDCD7B27AF2FB7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0x9C9DCE302B25AB78682A19C7976CBFCA
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x24E03F8E88AD82D8C85438B0593E0E61
were inhabited daily."
0xAEE97A1FFCE6814C696D5730185A9903

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0xFDDBCF9BD1139EF20785BAE85ADFFAF9
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x13758C8CDB2033D3D981B049DEA14DFE
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0xED173DF12A73989F6617505AA7D0039C
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x7002E7D47D5AAAF0DBE9ED576750F01E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0xA2BE083341A97A8FCC6CBCB81F8090D3
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x3F4DC71B3287D67B7975226D3D3172E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x00C28DDB5742AE27B92F7D2991C34FE4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0xDE45074E199BD18A5A3D84E1704B5BC6
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0xD3EB297981051E8BB6D4526B15CB618C
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x93999929436DDE904510FE181BD64180

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0x86676D964664E0F70914302AD343497D
liked for himself?"
0x0E6C1C011FA5C37BD988933772CA5900

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x6FD9B699F4B278375BBA14D52291A0B1
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0xAB7BEF2080A9C02011602C453C6A1D4B
lived much amongst them."
0x2E03576A4451E9DB2541B60DDB0F194E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0xC7EBB8461BE8F062A2BD030B3CA3AF44

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x32371B05E1F02B1395843C4C24BD9D21
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x137CBAC83227C6AE26032BA75D481740
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x0FE4FBE4BA58AB67E6CFE225B70A8126
conversation with him."
0x67AC318BE3F9642A4C0D7779FA80BFDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0xE29504C699A7B0E7029DFA9C3348CC9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0x551B0DCBFFBA2730737AFF092C8A630A
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x350D348AC6F6FEFE71A0C8A4B076D227
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x97510782255C07F5F84AAC8391E59EC0
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x42107FC68D4A0C3909EF7F3BCE10C56B
he is a very good master."
0xBE1ED6135C853FCC8DC97F533DFCF95C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x9899DEB881FCBDDB8E0A6B9070461B61
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x85FEF05559C5CD17EE32B71CD5DD3492
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x101E53A093C34324BBE353A85BFFDC2F
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x54E065F587AC262ECD3E544A1FBC7E34
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0xE27FA6E34259D993C40B93F2A24E4EF0
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x1FB24429096E0FB7FAC48471F5637086
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x25B09E1DF6530A2A36234F84A2CD8420
definite notion of his identity.
0x6F0D4AF8102D74E71C31C0670884BCE9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xE4798EE7D5DC1FF03E661B19107985EC
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x36C30CB53CEA36238FD1CCA74EE9D2F4
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0x2DECBEE157320758E7314A33916B98F4
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x27DA25CDC1813397CD4E6A0D8A44D61E
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0xA1337AE2E891F4365F1EA6545855D917
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x5B9FB18E5DA1461627D6C6BEF15696D4
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x6A3380D63D1D124384B7DFFDE5BB0B0C
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0xB080718FA16BEBE130EE2F1B41B042BF
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0x3F60AD787988F15A8972C04B1561512B
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x1B471048D39AEFC97F30CD3E511D6B40
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x1AEE40F165B0DC984C2BD7F2512DB238
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0xE13705351B0D1332DB85E7253A978B18
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x9D690A75AE6582CBC9DE0F8D4FA347C3
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0x064C813C6F5D27C9929C968BD9563B12
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0x8A8B99D6E1388C6D3007756AB5D909F9
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x1A55368B058FCAE90EC814E4969BD59D
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x8F7E06A1A43DE2D6BDE1A373F025EF9A
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x24ADA2217A58669A53577BB3BD510DFA
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0xB49EA735C50CEBD8433092BD905D3324
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x4FEF0D0BD81B296D4462C6CC03EA6CDE
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0xB06DA90D2CD7B7CC57C33006C78F429C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x4D83AC47270EBAA0F036F84B27E647A9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0xDB6266B5C9966609A1809B2F2A13AB80
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0xFD5B503917CEF8FDB54C328906E1F09E
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0xA24CDF9EB8B8CE207C5F3CD46507A208

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0xE5C5D19CB3D92E405C66AC661828AE9E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x9BF4E3F9A20AFB9B65BA8D69BA06CE8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x33B7EDA6F14A8370D8213D6F7F23F873

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xF1E0BABBC60284E4DBC6E2C626A34ED9
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0x403B6C6D185631415247831A122F31D9
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xED3A9C5A52A2386B757E43B4F6F0434E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x234D7138CA27337FB5E2DBD53B155A02
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0xE73D6ADE167C91758D95EFCDB6E2B096

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x3B8D629A4DE9BAD1DFA7A4E87F5EF7C6
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x96C55A10147AD83F3EBEBF865DDF66EC
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0x00BD2EE932F7D30EB02718298B374C9F
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x44264157C3DA2ACE919CB0209200E88A
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x75411B7C379F47687E0354D7E0974A4C
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0x1E97EF3876F01D603A84A62B08A014F0
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x290F8FDC0E9F676C27B3E7001D4E93E7
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0xADA05F264A7430C1E46E47E02AFB4AF3
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xF2B783F3703B513EB2D852F6A4ED3EA1
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x1082B13C7E850374D33D5234F1CE95C2
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x6F29215710A8A8EC870A11BFF013AFD7
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x9913966886ECB13D31A54606C54C6C00
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x5C69D5B41CB9BBF1DF472689C3C92260
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0xDFB3FBFC69CA88B92C11AA84C655DA19
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x5A6AEC5D192587879E127137A2777DCD
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0xFCC57D429F89FC9A19F6767B8F3284EF
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x8CDF18625FED77651C69DF426D5613A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0xC13FDB5068B62FE6D8A90364B7B06E89
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x39037A467553750C519E91C25AC25FD7
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x03082CAA5B9FA59D524334A18C5C6CE0
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x68A32121964A82D66486D63CEA42BDE1
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0x28AE2300B0CE8D440C2C03FE7B14D74F
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0xA310F94AA887CF6192DF598D230A360E
Bluebeard's castle.
0x15E480F7D4CD30A5E48828C938668F80

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x56D7D07E9E817E436A1BFAA8BC8C55FB
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x62B3390BF398585329D0B1B0287EAA05
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x9D2E3E0D13FBC0C2FD83DB6ADEE3F6A8
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x0BC21CB7AA2FBC2C22A0DCF5ADBFCD47
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0xE0B1574F1635BFE5D540A7AEED58B14B
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x1358A33A769ED78F40AC2E36BEC6F261
out the door whence the accents issued.
0xA98A8A5BE09CB2514CF60C3F7FBCE9E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x4A55AAFDD4B2BE08FC3CF35CA1DB0AF4
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x3F400EDD422786F541824F70C1E071F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x2FB23DBD3396B0FB78F1FD775DC65CAC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0x07C0569D4D688B3C80B5FF676A436B4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0x67B02842A0C3E374B7794EDD3CD5461F
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x2EE85BF300FD769B3FE506420817D532

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0xBDC73AD68850E3561D11772C48C1C8FC
odd murmur.
0x9320213064635FC4B585AA29CA203019

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x53B644964AA5F949CB4CFF3AA2A35076

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xCE156C49FCDF4D0786838E00B9E09709
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0xB7727426132463A97E003BA13A471710
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x4D7BAAAE366ADB99E853857F1A4294A9
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xD335B4930BBC69F086C4035E66DA850D
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0x1F45D4921C806FF0411137581B22D3B4
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x684E6977F1BA5B920370ADA880BA7B85

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0xCB1F7CC7A486CD0CBA43FA1FD70488FC
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x09080E48ED33DFB808C975BFCE84FB1D
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xB63024AF1EEF77C90C9C156FAECEE218
be conceived.
0x7F81ED78C4602D969A0AADA179BDF7B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xAD2E90BD9D86EACDFF19504F83163EE1
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xE1A9AB564F710D793EE293D2762BB152

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0xD5B4344CB5109C71B648F59405D8C3C7
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x588B0361A665901D041C9F193D38CA70
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xA8BED6B1015B8D5622E8BE322AFCC222
pupil this morning?"
0x3166341F4D1380502001FA756B52C8F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x762F395639ADC608C526C26DA23D7A5A
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0x169C29275B356ACCCE5A3C6A366F67B6
hall, exclaiming--
0xED7D927AEEF2920BF8B476AB6369C293

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0xB7B8D132F2453FE5079508D82026C789

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
0x5ECC99492F81DF4F34E98F1AEF5BDF84

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x2F65A44EDB04374765D9C114F55FE6F8
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x4FD625B20680494D13776D015C0E7455
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x891A033B6DBDD9D868B1B7801B760259
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0x3AA1620A4E708AB4CA5B10D4E5142DCB
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x386B97E97536E0F9747DABBF62F43A56
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0xDCC322D99DDD936D34D49593A5785293
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x767F1DD781F984E4758BB58B0908CC57
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0xB3E2BF099ADF8B828EB8553D56DC5652
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0xEA9E55F5CBF2C5E83DAE4F2708235DEA
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x0AA82A27D1870F0DD8AEE377BC5991D3
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xEC02F3EA0415F9B19FB7FF59B837C568
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x5E97FBF97DC1D00A503EADDE966DD070
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x20E46F281964D2F591DAB07A4569B163
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x2AA067208E9397DFC58FEFD106A58CA7
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0xDBF089C6B1673C4B4F46E2F671737558
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x15540534A326BCCA66FC05460F82663C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x0F787C1DC8D98D99F0FC71455F0B1739
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0xABA5BD6AEE77487A047A13ED19927546
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x91D4977CD0B5B8176897D5E6A051E49C
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0xC4256087F8F86B3BA4A0182C291E7D0B
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xD2F9B6E0C1331C25A58165BCC0A912EE
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xA3972A943F7CFDA9782C6F6AFA417896
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x8B7A51836C7F3E12E2D45E58DB8893F5
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x8743A12A1A353F5BB6B4CEB363EBD183
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x7D1BBC7217566EE1F9567C8129439573
of her mind and character.
0x5CA6EF482C2CBB499D11D88B55BE17B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x88E6C8F06071B16EF27AEC81601AE334
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0xBF77F8DEC67711D40EE22010C5A621B2
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0xC1101170E9F8BF1BE9E3986569792260
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0xF685B89AAF2E2BFA7C28DAED810A7287
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xA6DE8D937CD79F503BF9C4C0317B7A86
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0xB5201774BD97ECE3B2519292D6C31384
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x8A49454A623EC69E2CA31793406C8ECB
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xC9D174FAEF1AE2A926286351F4F1815E
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0xBD37FB9D6BE28A5C7D5F9F7AFEBF20B7
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xDC2076A1510FD83DE4AA4BC4FC6D9F28
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0xE4B8C6AA2ED67F6D8430A04A19840EEB
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x8CDEC6743B4AB4A94E5C82D1B953955F
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x45FACD046C5D9A582657B93ABDBD711F
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xC64A4697959C7E4A5AA5662A143F3746

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0x6D36C0987D27D4FF902E241A190382E5
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x70C92CDACABDE1216F4E7937A6F76514
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x2B85C97128D8DF4F9D47D5465E65464F
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x91DCD6508B9697B854C1A83164804E9D
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x2F56F7D18E401079CA637699481F6F5E
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0xED3A984572BDC42066205407283F5A44
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0xDB152BF6B147D833411FAC429EE7BAB4
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0xC90C9BF9B463A023567C34ED08690D0F
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x21699E3E428147B0449DA3321D1B1F1F
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x90DA659D629F46D72A388C8772A4C205
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x9A92328D5C30EA74DA2921A5A73BB7B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0xA61243261EF88B7A8A6C15F3A11FED39
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x3B16619EB342CC95A907ABA13B92679F
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x84396E7B8EF8AD33C7254E5F4D80C55B
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0xBFA27F7B34B6C2AA49095AF64720C4F2
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x2F9C70C33C27AE4B040E171C6C547C9D
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x34F1FE7EDF15539602E6EE8F7EF86418
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0xE93267B8B09639EBA7F24AC9902A085C
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x46C3B6DE2641832E0FC3BEC3B1AFEA03
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xC498F49E7D6EE78F43F6D4217B20F255
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x20958353F8CE7ADC13026E6A05589FBB
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x5FA63D06D9062A7EB89CEB767FD8E78F
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x6552AF6F686F1D2914978ADE8E0220DD
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x6478B16324B58DBA5513032E48856106
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0xB91AFA94423D8CB4339A4ABD2FBFF873

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0xA5F9846400B8FC2B81AEC518DA3EC0D7
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x3F83CA4DF5E73D9007C579F74F3BFF4B
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x15B89119E70A66CF9D8A53A77DF4478E
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x3A4F7EA6A3F13F20C64100BB10BAB0A1
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xB5D950B38472DB7FE9FE2130F47AEA7A
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0xB1653DA7FA0010D12F8BF4F516228E5A
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x6C95F8C77CBBDC4534EA9AFDE22A8EC6
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0xD0E4A3BD6C296FF06C6509D38301ADC3
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x5D75285DCF98C7F93C99D147D3D938EB
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x36AD28C31580421CB9C60FA432FD35E4
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x05A67EA249DEC7D31A583E0E9B8676AD
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xFF5A8B3696C3342E7D3114841804CCFC
every effort of that sort.
0x6DB97CC8E4EF8D4F51CCC1426EA29BF9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x3C71AA41ECF431851E654AFDAEC744CF
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x30BD1B6D7F344098483C37AD6EE31C2A
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x66BAAEF60493032C5D9EF3ED7A673CAC
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x28FF888B20B374825E60E58521A40F4B
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0x7228EAD21378C1F1533E78F345068F73
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0xC64A23F343E2CC4579A10A3E7392F2F3
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x7D13D19570E8216496054615B3DB854D
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0xCEDA93966A868E2D45E1797A883AE5E7
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0xEFDCA582E6CC62271105DB34B0BEB942
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0xEE7E56359E76A99D75206D64962F61E2
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x306ADB454CB9F0D0FE17BA2F6FF7BEB1
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x3476FFAB914FC916E0107E45C318B325
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x08030AD3DEAD1D03A43533A925D6ED83
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0xBE7F5996C2203AE0BC4F87136035535E
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0x39D6F73450DCDADC3403019DBD0C792D
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0x8FACB1B50713C5F3A63373DCA69285E6
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x01B8D91D4D56AB229125CCA760368435
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xD4B887888353431F6730CF22D06E0377
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x84903E55A2A74F92785D107593E02995
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x9D59802633F530053A49CFD02BE5792B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x8427BF1E2B8701F2BBF16891087F17CD
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0x6CFF5725F1D8CEEC7F3ABE72B98A749A
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0xB6C1753C286CBC0B339D4D0035981B0B
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x46B77CDEDE636497BBA6F3AB730970A5
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x7B5AB51DAB5432E61AC4299F123E93F8
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x342C71C62CCCB2CC85799C6774688F8E
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xD3947121F25B02A455857C35053A396B
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xE3DF339C693F05CE4E7802CE1200C518
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0x2CA6318DA2514CA560B88D6359E27382
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0xCD94D7953C12EEA86FEB0D16E3682469
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x3C7073314A32B40524781CFDF5383C81
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0x19C12C8C1962001E9A643AF6B5B497EE
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x240F4C4262F083A5BF95C3863AF7ED7E
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x537EF0E97961A47CF090248180CF42FE
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x7355C2CDEB1C69A513972D66CF1007F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0xD439EC5038FBD7CB786F6B63C2A530F9
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xD9494281116EC2EEC80B21BCEA60277D
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0xE5C50859C0AA9C095AA0C86113C5A22D
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x5B625E7B78323FD4532842704AE6D816
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x882CCA4CE7B8C0B49B7C1EE7AAD07E8C
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x690789C369B57DC3FE10E6960DF568C2
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x68301D8D7E168E8D0F1B1D878F8682B2
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0xE1871163BAC68842CF4A317D06214AF0
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0xF4D08DC84D11861A40614148FBC5A17D
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x288875C241E54F4D9086FCA554F99A5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0x1DA9F4F944657B0E7099C4276F583366
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x3189E4506F4AB8BCCF798B589B5F3E6D
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x26A18FD7F40FB8DB3B9398ED76317270
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x3A4A6FCB95C4823C55B6BABA9561D151
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0x204210B61DFF0E1C12BE7DCD8A327A1F
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0x9D8BFFE0582844B32530DDDB1EB7AE56
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0xA8B0F9F6EDF180803EB2B5022ED7EFF1
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0x729B3019F61710F835253E820717B7D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0xC7C47EA3DF24EAFA8F9FC43AA503972E
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x89F4AD23E0A785BCEB6238CAEB16D4E7
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0xB5DD86E5DC01A21C5A943488629BCB8C
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0xFF5748F83EB5AEE24741F0962F7A5483
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0x00B092848E5512E8150AD68E1EC03C7A
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x58E253982D9AD46BAD58F044ED85A9CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x11F0A6888A3A87828BB888614E96AAD4
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0x6CF5E1590A7E3F263893C87026FF5480
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0xC7297709283240A3433D650C9BE8D527
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x9FF2C3C189480B838BF36560ED5B9748
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xF9BF6FFEA8C8A576B97BDDE5EA5CEDBF
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x8A218F29D6972DCD324DDF0A464441F1
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xDA925E68BE01F09EF4C2D736642BD787
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x177D850411C85041B8EF4FF8722EE4AF
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0x5765F26BF2DC4B4D761511D0AD518C5B
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xFD6A166E0FBECDEAF1DE9D7B303A9E14
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xA55785108038E207CF5522299F4145FC
me.
0xA809552545BAB0B7982C5C268CE94848

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0xC9591BA79484EE88A0F1CE587AA045C4
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0xFD98F60507D35E998672CD08BA4A7EA0
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0x1EE4E76B919685EA4FA9C7C768C310A3
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0xF2958CAE18688D0F134B2C3A3AB02C02
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x9F5E7440651988F743499F2B9AF1830F
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0xFE916B22AC16E2ED658575D749D9DCDC
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x677F7C91C48B9995BF48A7966994E6B4
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0x2C6608C1FC97F747C2976E00C9E7E297
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0x1EBB73D0C079AE028715141050AE7DDF
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x7C61E64250794E089B71A88A2B4B0835
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x556509B948275B41A1D6A4BE0BA58139
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x717C929CE4D1DC0AD8660080D7A8ADD4
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x4A48973C8D573FEBDF016D0F09249289
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xC5C918856FA2DB9F651685C1A20C1A49
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0x2C88D068EE56ABDC246B739ECEE70C92
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0xD3C1385A920CC9859B4A0F3D97FEC6A4
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x56379C689BEA41965BC87B410AB1DD3B
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x5B89E25386FC9AB68C1AB667EA389E20
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x97B9C1CDA2FA72DB8A09F5355FE89E80
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0xA77DE9ABDC60C25EA713628ADC754811
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x44B009528C8A382019360451872E03C2
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0xFB0ECE2F26B6B72E8145FE2F46C56345
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0xD81F9B2F1F9A2F0341A4E1FC0D48F5CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x7B28400C57D3D7EE344862F32A8AC349

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0xA05AE22960078EDDD78027AD999A37B7
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0x6EBC2B2C4DF1EE5573C2969D796DDCAB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0x21DE0FE595EB2E19FEB04603D3F14481

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x017CE15969A3A109B3962E896E4E3BFF
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0x71C8A2FB5B6C05CEF7FDEB88200D66F7
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xFDC5360DC9F32FFD2DE6518ED943A76E
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x818C4CC846775270728B08250425EE7B
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0x50659625E08AA948364B9D8C80820854
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x97C36195EFE0E9175D9B1717B2703757
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0xA948D2252B17621EB38BACF3FECC0C75
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x94D549BB6AE779E72D0CFF32A389D472
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x85059AA976471ACCD659861A6B549574

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x78E984B91E3E6F663798D1D53D6155A5
now drew near him again.
0x9A390C8D65AD3A9BC672AA28CB2BD641

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xA7394ED8B7BA691177B0102E28D4A215
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xBD787229257EBE0EF3FF354EA2F05D62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0x90AFE9D9FC14A912667E260FC88603FD
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x2DEE3CDB80FE685143342806B2B4E2BF
involuntary "Ugh!"
0x18D082C7423D29B9F29C284E4FA0530F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x0C8A561E0D7BF2193690E861DA0CE964
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0x61CFCEDD3A69C9057BDE8A496B284B63
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x297499402BD4DCCD57C1CBAE5EA0D921
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x3B9401FDB1BCC20ECEC23E64E2BFE92B
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0xCB6CCDCA274B3720B9DBBD2D5A6D51D7
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x13F4AF439CC99F0DA2F29CAD90FCD570
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0xAF028D72B90C8FE4B9F115FD33EDFEA6
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x1C2A0B30F0C7AAF38F4C94019988ABEF
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0x40D4CD619B304AAF67EC09CE13210D6E
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x825ADC2217C3154D2444B3B9195A8438
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x531F2CFD9DBC283AA93186D320401B1B
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x459B6E4E27DC7BB2E0F73C7CE3DE176E
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x3814786CED49D97559038F599034C69B
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0xB43639E417B83D715629CFBE5F29D5E4
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0xDB1EF6848C0DA4F5876660BC1A953334
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x1818296FA408F677039A50E2DE7A8E40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0xA56543D3A45087E77342BAFE9EDC1815
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xCEACCF54385EC992F7B39674374F39FD
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x05FCBCAD06682F1DF3A411821B4FC388
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0xE8360720B6A46B7FED9C7DDC10D40B72
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x79E0D2FCF81693D16B25F476566CAAC2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xE926CAEBDD937F45A6DDD2C8F312CFB1
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0x323FCE97D81E89916478E049745E5514

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x15B6C74528BF1D3E2DA149384EC71FAD
direction before.
0x28C95E485E14625CA51D5C3BEE78D6C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x8853595815C0A2FF945E9D4F730DEEB3
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x7CB6442C567EE2C25B065C45C9D972D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x663EAEADB9684D096B0801018FFEEBA0
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0xB2019893EBD2D2637EA92254B0248112
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x68A0AD0ADC435AF0EA08B821D26E8B89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x8F855BDF0312E999B8BDB3D53B123699
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x04CC78E1744964A5FA9AD7FA931ECB0B
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x5FBD5BA8BFE80A461584C1DEC562D55F
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0x73B235E113AB78376A886C7D4297C865

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whose house is it?"
0x54E72BE48E3D29F0D4A939D4A91966FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester's."
0xD16B2942B59C6615BD0240B017966E66

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0x3C1F0135FF9B665205EC8F4CAD803A0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, I have never seen him."
0xD2318FAF42ABAF5E87BC7837C54AA37B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He is not resident, then?"
0x02314C5CAABD499A4149A97AC5DF0B45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0x3618D08DE02C13038E6A08EABC6528E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot."
0x93295C3045DEAE0602A9C148DF4DC524

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x0D72828AA7018D7B4142E50F0440543D
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0xEE66F803205BE5C6E242DD425B1CC00E
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x76B7F84E5E8FD8AFDB11BD4CDF3ACDAC
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0xBC14C900016F7189A789834BC86EBC65

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am the governess."
0xDBA581292623A9CBAD4BCE2B84383677

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0x778FE4FE0061AFFF748E1CE350415E0E
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x5676553198ECBB121DA1ED671638870D
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x8ADA86AEC16E3AD86D23A1274AAB0408

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x064DBCB1CE8B28958220BD1C6EC626E7
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0x1B17EA5D60A78DB76277E2FDF48309BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0xA0750E8EF321E09C4495AA5A0309B777

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0x957B0A4F4126A7DB03270367C9634783
afraid?"
0x451460DFA1322AD6D23251C112F4F036

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x7AA4E8B1F113E28D29B24C9610943349
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x7A56D3EF3E1AE47A87BB4F807EA72438
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xD0002F636F6AB4B8092014CFF9BE4CD4
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x653BB0D3B1EE532E4AE3FDD5572E1254
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0xA460CCFDF797EAE865A11985D4AAAA17
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xDA7BC3AD3E85975DC6FEB565F2323048
he laughed.
0xD3987A2A52D20224A5AE887644A4F84A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
0x60B4CA12E7287E395E13AD94BB477052

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0x5D7397ABC49BEAACA2A99A8D9410D5A9
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0x8F9137C0F03642D4F73AB5A495662161
come here."
0x70D0C5F9B1262CE072ACCBE741C01B2D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x8472F04F9E65792C9863FBEEC6F4BD11
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0x0FC2D08913AD148B2425B7844AD022FD
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x5C51DD5DE13AFC7BA503D7A6CED6CAF7
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0x5BEA657ECC28A30143D8F4745E368FC0
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x914A63998C329B44692DF1205ACF69BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0xEDE911D8DBC9F58B93F580E0994DBCB9
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x05E3286B5F112F048DCE95454EC75888

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I sought it and found it.
0x10123D57ACBEB3817FC16E061D6F92E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xC8752208765A7100F54254BA51C14529
you can."
0x87F196CE1CF89B3553FE235BC4423A8F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x99622F349D85C416901E4A158DB51BC7
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xEB5BD995D7C3EE6418B8C1B51D8A897A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x208E24B8C5083B39F9B9777A19359332
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xD008EAE499E7B536B7A0ED1959C1EF40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0x265B5685993B57327FE951CBD7CDB13E
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x14E70C1F85B1326CB98795D7D8F5124D
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0xA56FA7EBF554E51D4CEAE875AA7C1953
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xFA4C8A9A85AA9D4E11145E3FCAC028B2
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0xB107F6216E7C2F84E82E574798E6E58A
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x0D5D6BAC272527AF79363DDD34B6EE6C
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xD613DF4091782CFF0DDB359D2351718F
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0xA9EC8C0CDCABD938EF16DD6A28925D5C
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x7687469CEBC5F67186DB04CE1AB4CD68
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0xF40A02C499BC04425216FE5FCC49E07F
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0xF98282E19297C99789EF9A422ADAA0D5
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0xC70AAB546D0E878B1FC1E6D330DA252E
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0xCBEC03E74FD96A03AEAB77C9BC41DDD5
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x78453B08A3C791D2F6FA57C3448A4B4E
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0xC1B90F5521C0AC59A26BE0A9AA43BFF4
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0xD72AC1DC2CAB66400C67E521BD92754B
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x0AD37BF8C78D4BFCCFEF514682267B24
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0xA41DFC8C489EFB2AD3EAA7E17D47F0FE
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xFDFE10015876CE2B74E827B679608E1B
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0x8AACDB27BD38EA45DC448D6871E805A7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0xDDEA8C20C17364158C6FDC97EB1C67BC
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xC543FD326578D98E409C99B33561D5EB
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xE22326144CD90F4E290B9C7804D5E674
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0x77E017FE09234A1BE85FACADDB79C5D6
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x6ED1A475A2151FC157D2651BCF5C2F67
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x7053E229D8AEE714E9670CD0F38DA6E2
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xEDEA9A1966B73E63D6CA411256009DCF
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x959A8B548FD22B985E4DA99638D868F5
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x7A927A06751278611B3160D2CD3BDA18
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x79634E5DCBCCFECEA4B176AB23A166FF
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x00B7D8DD75C40F46B624BD5BB8D7DA26
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x9D9892D21DBAFFB8789AF065EE286A0C
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0xD6CD1F0DD8F5F8BEFF153143FD51B4B7
as it would be under his.
0x12708427AAF16F28C66E162220CD0442

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0x1CA8B5EE2C656EECB0DA229DC5FCC853
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x64D52A155859D8CFEE0FDCCF72D0B18D
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x8A82D12265360409A260A800EEBE2BAC
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x48EBF235AA86D2305F2B514A094CC2B7
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0xC3F54527054552C89DE0107C5DBFCF98
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0xFD5A3156678F097120D91987B97DBDF2
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x5AA55D9AB51C54ED1E68BB4778B76E8E
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xE0B1725E8A1EFB8D48EAF0B6EABA1956
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xAF9699772F1796FDC6B67BD1D2D631D3
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0x15CD1D0A214F962728BA91FDDEF08062
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0xF926413F023CEF43324827490C468B10
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x325F6AFE87977E1B6F6F956DB052D61E
door, and went in.
0xFE28BE3BAAA4BC24669DF1C4495FE841

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x7B8D4ADF0AC500BC01F2E63F7B3B8C3A
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0xF67D29BF640CE04A7A1131CB9013DFC2
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x90E570585A2976EFAA974DA380850B8B
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x266DC538D3BCDC678266BE9924B582BC
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x4774D5720231732C52626732EABCE989
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0x9462DF35E52A3AD4E8F3ABAA6E235F1A
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x8AB60D45409858BD917B3FCFC1CC56D7
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x45DB9104D39C7CC311A79EFB036C3989
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0xD919568035529958F68AE18426511169

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x30C39BFEC705CAE0E0CE3883EC1717B6
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0xC25768B764DE8EC8305FFCCF6CE330F0
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x08AD9A188CCE53A9BF5251B7E33D1443
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0xB85D34B3F542863180A091348189E847
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0xFE6FF3D46B569994025FDA4433CE2263
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x3C914BE824D6B952AADC8E8C2DE46D8C
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x9DC90086E0D52E08F0F27FD38303AEB0
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0xA13FF7ABF6BBE1F0A21295611A664E71
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x94902AE27C3A00CD53B943D3085D4415

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What dog is this?"
0x0224468B02945231BF43C523195F8062

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He came with master."
0xEEFDCB9F8F0AAA168CB1A4F418D37AFE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With whom?"
0xBDCE3A58BA42C3E5ECE6372C0928BE18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0x8CA2F7094F609C44A5B0186713BE4B98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xADCEB2A16E4A461E4687322DEDADFAB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0xF3E86F2C87B7F228331708C3EEC677F3
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0xB1D07FDFDDCB13C9405B1C6AEE9DBD62
sprained."
0x4CE25A56F110AE37A7F83DDA90D052E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0xF9D4600EBE67B662DC1F6B0466389B1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x252AEB6E4DBCEA519C77CDB133468FA3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x2545F5E4BB3027BD01C0C8AE34911068

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0xA5D7B7577D1D26E92619D9A5C641C2AA
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x345E47E5F0ED84AA1099E6D2ED55CC87
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x837DFD3FFEC56DA040D970C1313C2F98
upstairs to take off my things.

CHAPTER XIII
0xDA8220BEB5911E04A16EC8856B4B452A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x93029657A47EECE1274501C9F3C871C8
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x90EAD121F23EF047A0F2653B93208BED
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xDAFE9400CBF038C8DACB972689E337AC
and waiting to speak with him.
0xD07C89007EDE92A9B4C483616693639D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x889E783F2FFC39977C8A854B9990D24C
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x9F8A808D8C916F0E3CABAD22893394CD
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0xD75C09E4EF076306D45BC3CBF5EA18A5
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x692C9F5F63B667F0707165E5C35D8022
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xE1B5A1FF3FC95D89799F7BA0F954A904
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x6B33B4416DE80909A24CE7618CEBA6F6
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x9D48947C0CC0D8BCC730272767372DED
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x6FC8B26483D6A79BEC6A970130A492ED
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x7156FE92D32BB58B3D8E792E30257372

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x9FD52A655588E62668A86400034AC088
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x805D0AA537BA3C896CB89BFA660E7BD7
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x8916ED306BD5CB23A40F2551BDAC1C35
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x0440FFF941F031E014C13B7CDBF2470D
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xF0A066E41E90E06BD60809B5BF7A95A9
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x6C579FD2C610D19551689280EBAB1976
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x043BEA287E731D464F31D5689E765458
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x5B963872FD87866C4A86ECA660B9E0F5
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0xE2EDE6246694A92C2391156C500ADA7A
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x00C20F03452C87605B464E9D1C7EC722
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x980A3687727D4A49CDD709AF630D659E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x89788D07768AE45FF396D80FEADDE5BA
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0xC3A68382D92C64BD7342051FA78BD0BD
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0xA941D5B90AE101A3103848BBF7A50860
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x96CE709557E65DAECCC39DBB4C2E817F
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x9E04D97A120C3C3FF1600090BFAC05F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xED7CE13E89BF64F870B9A5BF77116F66
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x05F96B684CA7D18FD24AB5C0A4B76759
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x6D08863648334045ABCE463689D1DF9B
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0xFE9EA9C884BBB73D2C6BE722CEEE4EF1
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x2151F4670D9E8A8C702270B2860DB8A2
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x3483DDAD4D63C4942CA60C6838EC9E2F
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xD8016438218F73D1EFD8B795D252B67D
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0xFAA272FABA8C332094103B1D3A8C28AB
fireside.
0x66B4F4E5242DAA48FD5CB31FA5D39CF0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0xA4D96B34C1EEA50E15EE8FBCE90E6ECF
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x2BB61109C004CB51A1ADF786C3364831
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x266AD7B0096FD535BDEC9A64ACC8923A
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xEDACE3D1944F75383059455062379EED
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x0D4C89E3873D934B44F036A28F02DC80

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0x25171CE60C8E32658536E70EA40DE7B9
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x3996675F9639471B19FF57B9E2D5F36B
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x40CDAFD01B7645DE5529AAE91D066735

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xE3BBD2A9491907F2C14FC5090CEA9275

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0xF1C40D27F18F6F2CDEF1219AF1F566BD
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x96115C6A0D57A28DF0F9E9F82310F95D
candle."
0x3B614BB32F78E39AE712A399E9528545

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x425CB6E407E510A7FC81D39B414E2C49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x984236379078A71C6F7110F95B8C3E00
is here."
0x24DEBBB5399E5F50EDD06E62F53D5B54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xAC220A1B2A2DBCA356B5FCF902FE7E1D
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x3CAF3399EFDB803D15359E48B6D8D61B
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0xEDFE4AE1537DFFA5FD906A83AE867BB9
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x3C83310615ED95A0ADA437BE6157293F
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x20A9B5A60898F44E8DE22164F77991BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x7FBE30F1135225451D87F90D122721E9
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xA43D19CE6FB2755351DF941937C87970
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0x1460A3F7D1AB0949E75EE47EBE0354E9
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0x06A350F0F88ABBFADDEC6CBE8EEF80C2
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x2D7C3C1D87D411853300471BAEAC665C
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0xB64064E4F3FF596F0F141D7ED04FD021
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x4919C426D9BC8199F5FA9D31A6ED8107

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0xE3D3E6E6A6D22B04BCB157A67DA7D1FD
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0xE8958B73315C1DBC51A563BF84661171
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x84096AFB43CF53AE18C69F73276DE752
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x9DB0C2A28D1DD2575C3636597E457D97
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0xA9512AE5F781FCD417257ACE6B693521
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x8EBE8312214B338A4E4F0C5815E10FBF
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x4CAB1A8D31D0028EE3646E1AC8171DF0
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x92FA76820658DC5258EE316ACFFFEB1F
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0xF522FC48F446970BAF85F70EAB25D9B7
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xE38C2A9A80ED56230152197DEBB70B54
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x281BE9DDA648BFD643FB4F676B91A6AC
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x58B1828DC820765BEB7C5EFE55F24F88
neither tall nor graceful.
0x2E56334BE96DF1DCD297E3C75D4E2F3A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x92FFCA66207A96F821AB303336D49EF0
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xF253783427EF0BF5B26FF6C8BD526083
lifted his head as we approached.
0x42399AA4EA1833951E1B4198E7FD9EA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x3F952EB4642E2638D4EDADF2F44DB8DD
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0xE49FCB12D75981CDE3D6C3C9A40D9AE4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x02A87AA8AD8C77843B9C7DBDC220C79B
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x1519A5C457BF169E82FB14126DE08959
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x8C35046850BD63DD6062A18F1E6DA151
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x982B4D10BDD6565D8B2CA0E5FA4033ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0x16DBE53A1F2E65C83914037F9D5D94E8
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x2F83F8E69CD9A77060BB3C4AE13E936B
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x935244578F9B7C31381CA4E39F355A51
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x9EE165E8F5E97436C94B77B05CE673E5
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xC8C98F036FBFB05A9D85E42CE3132576
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x9C3CCCB832DB94353C7E9B1BF8339770

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xDB4F1967757DE8B290F35C4DF0444FDB
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0xF56D31B6A1821634B679C204BA1196CD
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x66F4851FB2ED772B8D5E202563C2D36A
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x43D23DE00D38B7B6EF17F1DC461E4B8E
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x9136997D9CD8D6814ACED0D02B27B769
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x3742F1F586A2C8DF14DE46A1E9A2A1FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x81EAE828040A7D3B8B9A5CF6C08A5761
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0xBAB7A63BC46EEF40E14005682D09468B
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0xB830D34BC0123C281594F7783959303A
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0x061CAD82084A729A80440C97FF0A9394

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0xC97B920CFAEE8335397FD476B67C4572
might perhaps spill it."
0xBC69E4C8B9F59FBDE119CFDED683FC89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0x463CE9C0559AC0ED541B21718019BEE2
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x9A7BBFC71E37D5FFBD95AEE4ECB0A436

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0xCEF21631989C40B4DB3EC6B239FB41F2
votre petit coffre?"
0x723371CCC997E30703DE58DE208C3FAF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0xFC425673BADDCA0D81798D659135B83E
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x008114C986EF96B973BCADAF6CD0B80F
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0xA99DFEC835666AF7510A29135919A995

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0xFB35887F7F0A996E83FE219E5D22A390
thought pleasant things."
0x60262485DB1832BAEB7A58D1CF37A12B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x66C53977DF0334D2E61404EDA7D9029F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x165B753B2ECDDCE7E83E913A4D06512D
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x3BCF460C62999E09CD3152220A051964
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0xAC4D252B405E162D54614FEA49ABE159
nature."
0x0778D12100E9FF331B9C7ED201C4D2FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x4B29FC73F5F2C7D8EC13DE88617770A4
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x4584715828DA152B162D59C58EBBBD0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x54EEB90864DD1265F496A191D13A33C1
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x9405C0DFE13CAFFBCB6E5463B259B61A
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x454E99699965B667267FAE2146519844
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x10ECA280A038D01C87494D672FD6B43A
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0xBC646588E034A3E3BA5CAB6C7439EF2F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x142BEF76649787EFA20FF618041FEDB2
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0x94BC0FC21F3453C0AF809994C3E72E0E
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0xA5232A69EE07C820129E56F4074C7036

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x754833D1B5177461A3485D8A58E41AE5
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x64E0B267BB60278650D42BC188DA3A1F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x98678A08C72090DA644528B5E8C0A922

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x652B65B534B09910273A8FE3328C2492
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x5BEC6DA35B828A2D1A0803B5E6F5027E
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x4303790D16D7D9F64AD67693FF3335FC
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0x9AA023FEA86EA90CC3418BF6C1279DB0
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x99429ABAB88E68B1BF5E9DB3C2A82955
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x927A6B1AC686847C0CA07DCF335F21AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
0x3B5BD3F2310CBD6DF2A81C53DDE84344

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you came from--?"
0x07729F3CD7842C23FE5320E0AA5E25C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
0xABC87C102813C81FF780A3201F19D538

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x78F3F606E98C758E46A9B9D2DBFF1E2F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Eight years."
0xD1955F6F1CBB2EA9E6C7258BACE5BC96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x64F656556A1316BE847DC2301948AD28
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x2BEBEB7DFB7297C585943731D5EDC67C
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xDAC556397BA5BD3AE5C7E8C0B8953F7A
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x7367A4ECDE40875596EF5F5FC6FD7870
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have none."
0x5719D3BCEE6B9C800B3967A8C3139B51

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x932D066807DFD3ADF5992877728295D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0x1CC7D8DA8A5160008010153D889E9E51
that stile?"
0x53386B8C24217AE33EE67D929C71FF60

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For whom, sir?"
0x3D56DF5097CA65D5FECED3A625E87134

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x28634C8F6F22A8A096B88E93F8EE08A8
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0xF6802F85FC1DEFC244B49F9CBA688FDC

0xFE5335BAB25383310FDA80C8CD54237A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0x6FACA13CCFD2F044B8CE5FFEA22A97E6
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0x91CBF162FFC1A480AFCBE6A36F09AE49
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x3A1B6C36A28DC67C8933B24FC0468BC9
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
0xA98906EAD1C883FD5FD999CE09B702E5
revels more."
0x0CD10A79E023A49341E0AFBAE76ECD91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xFBE25E89E81E0F8A81F4BBEF1F6CABFC
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0xF1B87D48E45610CA822F3FFE100C96F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x1E935D238AAD24596343B84C9031612E
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0x6425F6288F8C2558EA8C9F89540D2D14

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; none that I ever saw."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And your home?"
0x0AC1BF31469C68B43A6FD637FBA9858F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
0x004C8FEFB4C83A69A73623B154F9E1AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have no brothers or sisters."
0x094A8434C5A785671EBBEB541AB8E28B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who recommended you to come here?"
0x234E55FD0A4414BA9E28CDE581BEB576

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0xA7E1A9E0127386E81A975B16055905AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0xF1EEB6D9084EF13DFAE5B9602FAF1DC1
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x918A811563D67131BD81DC329A59C8FD
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
0x3726517887D1E9EC0A921E92EC322D88
Adele."
0x5343946B6869BBD01FB7A26ECF4BF616

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x6A2A5F235F292C34BE3B4B78F049489E
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x221C8A79CDD6A75090F02ABD78853358
felling my horse."
0x445D904163DF6D565C1EFCBD0BE74C5B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0xC1E5FF0FFC415A416E6D35FDEE4DF9F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
0xE72BA2EACBE009553582961C3BEE2B07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The widow looked bewildered.
0xF0A5D1B60BE0714F1B19FF77485504CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0xAADBD6026F72F7507FC29208AA11B4A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir."
0xCCC46D19079AFDAFC76975E486C8E90F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you seen much society?"
0x2511B9015B9F9B545D19C0126C567558

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0x0B461F9A04A2BA3D0645C2CF7213DE9E
Thornfield."
0x1E88C76C5506BD25492E545205B29166

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you read much?"
0x29CC2F70F14B663323DFFA7BF41F6D52

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x49B30026324AFF2DEB82843DE0FC772B
very learned."
0xE98DD70C00ABB58C8547A8D232373520

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x423657401DABDE341892D5602CFFE99E
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0xA2D7E3CA21FA2BA267D25D42AD9BDB56
parson, is he not?"
0xCFAB898DAF43CFEF83FC1F7CC276BF09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xB10BBA4E69502D55CEE25A85CE2D372E
would worship their director."
0x550A2D26073B4A7876D7900A24E9DC9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, no."
0xA52E473C3DE16C94D8930DC34BA3C852

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x58017C2BAF8ABA027AD3337A3D8C08FD
sounds blasphemous."
0x2F5D2535134DB9FB26EDCAA49DE1B4DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x8B9D5C1B9C35BD33A2B31CA001A495E7
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x75B0434E926F0B3D0B78961EDF81765E
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0x1B95DBAB22A7E36F4E04394FB2906330
hardly sew."
0x8AB1C93801B1777D210697AE5F9697DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x0595A6252DAC08C8E8D1D7CC2276EF43
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0x1E18EF02C2AB6A33AF0FE066B3D36083

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
0x7231B35A36A0B3D2E264158A24BA7A92
Rochester.
0x447F1F8030D12EDE4DBC79B4F4D0D967

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
0xE66CC24669B32820C95FD74D1EA0560E
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x1D076DABDBD62D2057C9CCB5C36CB198
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0x46B0D5C5B98CE94E1589F7E412B09F3C
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0x69ECBA8376CC546406068AB9EA77D951
to bed."
0xC2474FF3B8F25A760B31B794BABCC6D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x624BE478D4CB1E0FA6A5B215BAD79E68

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"About ten."
0x51E49080720347EF8E9DF08CD3895DDD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0xE8652C485D4DA2913E13F6C63D983A6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I assented.
0x9545286C5A1CEA1581E7C377F142BD19

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0xC4F3C67CC303E64754FC7B77651457EE
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x87083F6A10625B126355A93E3B633F79
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0x9D7AC789DBAA22928A7AA11F5D7EE257
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x6406EF8F2737A3B65D93D69990F8FA59

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A little."
0xEA46D5C3C1888C2F5CA759A42E6C0A67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x3E8A74D075CF68B8FA63B407C62CEBAA
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x506368A1AB34039186FAFDAA7D56D074
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
0x5459C922F6294AF5DC290573CA6A30DB
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0xC66CF824145A4714AEAFCE7685B7CCC9
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
0x5F13274347A06B5A7B3091C0562C3196

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I departed, obeying his directions.
0xC5E6AA8C6AA3B3D8E54BC4CF13133BDA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0xFDFA5331DBB00490D7E15F08F450E1E3
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xAC5FBABE369D9231E94E354F418BD098
not well."
0x84332A6C24E7D1FAF7DC3D5B699CAAEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0xAA5584B8CE56D2F546DEFC605AB7D519
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0xDCBA6D1796980B07BB8483C985065601
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0x1491CDCC7D7E87810A37AB8C108C10FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
0x4D47B3EC6372FCB78E1ECE3CBE173F16

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x0CBCEB52307E67C0D6A8906D6035042C
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x26FFBDA84471726502D0118038C4C77F
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x013998E7B0F020F6BBE240A91157F071

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
0xF64545DDBA6547A961B5B637E8C57CCE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x89FEA7472C5B2B73CD28E97BA1365B5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x93BC3DAC4F44C1CCE7804F59BFA67525
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x7E6FD0572E8429CB591D5E74907CD397

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x634BD23969F53AF5C3A8A337F7F80611
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x4E23A6B12E3045749410C6FAEB580053

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0xA12B349DB1B441E40EFB31367D1838AC
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x64E5DCA5AB886722859A74E4C209E0A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xDD3A8E38F3887B8AE94CC9C223F814BC
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
0x99F4DF3ECD20928B8B4187D02A7195F2
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
0x35A2BA902A2A27836F7E970DE270E9EE
hand yours?"
0x26E4A0F415D39D9AFD478CE40ACBD675

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x2973BC94E217ECF35823DDBB67513599
some thought."
0xDA737162AA71B2CFB2411C5307C48985

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
0xB34B2680AD8FC304CFA7BDD03C24A605
other occupation."
0x99789737E9843BDDBBD6C2A15CA70E3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where did you get your copies?"
0xE987F017EE7BD2D0B44736E7C6A0C77A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Out of my head."
0x61208B3793492B4DB9AD206F7E461948

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
0x1E692D9E6EA8247B674E9E281B369455

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
0xCD2AE10E5CF92665A8E8AF13FB21D600

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
0xB00AF6DD2643E31D20928B9CED94A639

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0x498B64FA1E5239A7F72DA860965F7EEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x6E4AB19F2948E448F6A2973931400DD5
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xDD790CF1F80FCCF44D985D0CEAE085FF
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0xF4C8917E221FC4D5B850C9B9F067A685
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x8605D2C7B082AFB651EF18A007D455EF
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x5AC28FC32AD2CEC882DA36C857FD9CED
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x23E0C6C3C9420F9F39CB4E442D350EF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x9D14083F49BD54901BA557791AC24335
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x311FF8D5E216DC44C2D97750EF238C3D
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0x204DEA201A5A4DD0459D59DCE515CCBD
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0xEE7BB9FE03E800EB671E588C7741C9CA
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0xE5C68D91DCC8F707AF16F237D0801C95
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xF98DCE794939DD1CBD75325AC3AFB95D
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0xF1A50D09EC0E2C4CB2A31FA513D39C93
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xEC68E0F67EC494F8F5F3B6BC579258D9
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x2605715A0FC834A345E33B761F6BAF66
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x047BAB69054DD0D0994E26EE80E109E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0xC5091E9EBD6B04D614EE23F08C11D379
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0xCDAEB8FA027068EC58C09785C14CBC86
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x661548686A05A6325D2F8ED613A3FEB9
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x88C9172A18C146766A0FA1597CB17EDC
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0xD5D02B76C94D67F0BAC53212528799C4
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x8B0205807A66FB071AD065B8A365E8DD
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x6D8973990874844B65577EDB6461A402
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x965E3E924161E4245B7D91BC89A2AFAF
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x46357C6DB024C68B4913F70405C6974C
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xECC80FCC8B7198D08533854542557B19

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x3343AA5C80CC24E8A3799613DE23C827
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0xE6BFA98241249C658C3E997F070BA562
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0x8E6CC67A9156C0A796AB114E9A6E2249
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0x5E025A34B92837BC26108CBFF2D22568
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0x05176BFB732D5A7ABA1DB88C336FD488
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0xFA56EB88E660B36E39EC73008C6B5D4E
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x00010311FA05BAF37BB63B182B723E91
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0xC5D6D92550D5E551247BEE6888A7CB14
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0xC2B0965058382CD1F24A5B64DD904768
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x7F4CDAF1CEB5E7817F33C887EFA9BD38
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x56E34B4588A441067F3E78D0FA432396
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xEED057200A31A618967827189C19F29A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0xA4E61185A9E0157DD036DB918A5990A0
presently.
0xC720606CE758493ADC101DCC0E3A1A7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x9F562DEA273BDE576AE1BDFAF05E7805
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x114F9BE08A178B8B3431D3E7B0416C5C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0xBE3E6CB48C456574A944F8595277A856
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x9AC6F1F4D1E867A6EE1428862C4BB976
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0xEF53431433D49DA9BA18C4D0AFA4A597
each day?"
0xCFD341EB71879D05A1DC5C343E834CD7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0xD6C9B243BE3A5466698822629116B6B8
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0xC36688D8D8B766E39DE0B1E7E63FC2B7
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0x981367876A6FFF63CD0284FD559B88D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0xE492066AD5CBEF4A1E0A942B77C656E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0xBA1E9EAD82128036C3B33F6B4F4B527F
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0xCC02F2450C6D73679F5BC8C41582B865
powerless to realise."
0xD5D105237CF488D511103CBF78282231

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0xFFF2F78EFDB27316F348A9742CC4ADB5
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0x893BEA98AC5041ACC0439609663F1270
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x6D64FA859F24FBAA221BE4D2100C86AE
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0xFA734DF569A1908E02F9C09C2F836CE8
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x61D27BCED87D04D463A2E520F0E52D91
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x84E6784808EBAE9475C47A7A234CC36A
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0xE62D7458091DBA351B12167EB88784BE
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x01E032E20AE5D895CCE42335A31D7C05
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0xD2B285446FB93CE21A0DD36EBF098E58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x04F31A6BF61F00497FDFF0C1E380C99C
watch, he said abruptly--
0xB92837BD76046A69AD2FF6EDD8FCCFC6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0xBB02F9A92ED0C56D787E1E6996DF4BCF
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xE5E1DAA4AF9625B84A5DB4C00CD4CA56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0xAD5840043B4B4DAF48954CC8E2E903FF
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x918415C23776590BBE80B5FAE5CCECBE
much.
0x1C8B32BC37F7B06F71192825CFA08EC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x520F559BE40DD42599E555211D820292
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0xC33BD042C0CF8C3FB74D358136BB0522
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0xEABB9AA56013511384E07C65C9A43C13
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x324E9094F5691800ED96F4F71FF8500F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x525A9C13A975E4765E12B79F0CB64EBD
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x06BD66CED8558C22403494CC23824138

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, is he?"
0x8359D09D89346B05E4177CE3E36218D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x951C9E864BFEDBDD474BCAE544562582

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0xF7552AE993A696277E8AA4419EE36930
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xD045B1264CDC6AA60AB0188BC1510FBB
temper, allowance should be made."
0x1BAA3DC8492A71D9180FA160065CA95D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why?"
0x1A7509121D2A3E91F1A46D4D531250F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0xB2A5FCE7A334CA923D92A5D8BDE6F53A
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xF932D5643AD6649B0DF40898DF5AF6BD
make his spirits unequal."
0xB433F54699C17451D06C501C07349941

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What about?"
0x767C776F0884848A07F423EA6B5F9D7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xE31D5E831EC437C26F9A401B4841036C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But he has no family."
0x58D3CCD56F3EDB6E7EF1C9012AB427F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x9BF01117E37709077B89EAD5E798CA08
brother a few years since."
0xB53AC980D14B6AAC5267F2BBCC7DA2A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x3386F3B4D5DF5464CC344EEE4315AFA0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0xC7752ACBB84B6293F6DCDD47EAEFC31D
the property; only about nine years."
0x55BBFC47D1D4082C0FD79A96CC095619

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xD59C1F448CB40D3987A3D444C596D523
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x3D186C65755276882E05936F35F54F0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0x862A7DA115BD39E35D0AD780A42736FF
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x498C14B4CCAE8E489EE293D83E5E1A69
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0x735D75127BBCAB146292EC03F9F3E122
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x70E1A0B6822D3E320A0C0701E075F186
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x056449782224CFD2EA0CBA063769786E
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x1BB2340A171DA8BBFF4D35A1883F2013
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x46A441DD3B67CA912B000CEE8D2DDA0A
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0xE16FD3CD7F20CB1DF41C042ADCFB3F7E
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xB7DA2E35C3181E7773F2DE841783E9F3
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x1010EABADF73590C3B8B54351A59A787
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0xC9C77B0884F82E214013D44F93B84C7C
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x8CE29646144277E1540231A36ECCFA0A
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x376F1769EE8BF500064B0F2FC48EC55D
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0xE18AEF468BA6EBC94B4622E40C14CC2A
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x399C55CA69B04DA7636F86F41251E68E
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0x28F0C79F9287FB76E38DFB6C61DE410B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why should he shun it?"
0x108D536EE1D30215E34BEE162D233F96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x15074AA67A77C1D2721DCFF20E34090F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x36068F98CCC5BB62AA874FC547583C8F
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xA1D2A823889F9EAB843BFCA244F69FF7
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x4C16D2F8B6668BAF8A48F9C466015FF7
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x260576504595500CE9FC3F595D5614CD
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x1D14DA0F2AF612E01073A15CB316A306
subject, which I did accordingly.
0x7319B8E6FB3030CD9B7776B1D6F84ABE

CHAPTER XIV
0x20B870444B380B2504B204C42416F4CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0x556A45791170C54923ADA21CBB799DBE
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0xEAEB7B07106AE2ACFFEC0103C56301E4
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xBA6FCE93C27DDCFE6BA7274F50A5ED88
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x121EF4543BB65FE275B590C68AAFF1B7
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x4A95FE793E12A369705379766830F7D2
generally did not come back till late at night.
0xD43D3DF43A3E772C97CEC878AFAD078C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x6F11166C2E32B1DF8B5402F83FB764A2
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x6EFA4EBF1B194D46DD9D98E841D2DBC6
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0xD7353EA69A3DBEC8378051EF89A111DA
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x4BDE090C875C2A939F6F6311120417C3
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x61C8B6BB203DB099979D665B66F6EA7E
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xFBFC34AA93867B5C3EE695921A7EE2E1
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x37BC24A76E3C251640680BB43F4C6257
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x12138315B34D2B6A647238E67DD7CD5B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0xCCFE8A7D9472BAB60931987EF27D3574
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x3138F57C498E71CA105F74043632B5B4
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xAC55A665AB4F02D184AAC2DA1713470E
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x9D3638F9A683600EC3DC815BDA51EE3C
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xF4415B58ADB9F8E77701B98459B1AA24
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xA327798C083E1A1746EF1B495C8575DB
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0xABEEE78556CB7F906F561D2B0B32DB9E
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0x884FF8B039CD88ECA44289837D9D9F01
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x64BA6001ED53AC6E2F3D94C6EA4743E8
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x7C5A4383590FC340AB80520DC2390F5E
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x643EAE63C239DB201A68BAAD18E6DBB0
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x01DB67AACA513383258E893A84097178
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x821B46B2EE548FD7B5FC2A5E1F978FC5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x77919D7049583E85B9C8872EAEC58065

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0xFAEF8C6C9AD34D4490E6B3D2CCA27F94
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0xC4F16E782D50E12FB43308C159F73D88
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x183A165D538632538E21A27DBC4C5AFF
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0xBE976D8AC5801B3BF9A926984A470B8D
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x02BFEDD874C773468B4118885217F38D
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x4C3BCB697B97C977380D10EA5E336077
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0xF7A63B65CC4AB3099031E0F4381ED401

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x6577A16C54499324F2FC8846A81278D8
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x2A979D1682B68F93BC0F095A50B7B0DC
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0x6D8BB69616A4690D5A6E31B56F47F55D
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x61FC4481154B251244798898BB968439

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xAE39AC2DA6C92E92DACD4345C478791C
contemplation.
0x7BA7DA6ED77E892247F2DA02B59DB686

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x9D9377B49653865D3DBDF32AE2DE6FE7
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0x4B46E7CFADD5DC79E8CCEF9118FF1D96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x076C373968F44B3E337F5ABAFA281AFA
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x15B2B7A70C7582248FFD829F4D34994E
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0xE62A9FD35C45FDF5CD7919AE43098B69
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x8DACEE1C6E79C191D796EAA41A51F009
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0xB7794A374D21D29A3890AC3D5D633EDC
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0xA1D7E65D54E2F792EA6B98B33DC44AF3
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x33A22144C6AC98679ACD000B0F69C9C3
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x342118C89E8F67919C255AD60366D2C7
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x079C89FBA2795A49FF9256D459BCC22F
said to be thicker than water."
0xB301BA57B771014EBA970B6B25F16945

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0xF47268D00FE994166D516B4BDEF8A774
knitting-basket in hand.
0xCB28E42E64C03FAD312DDF507CB4DAF1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0xC13814028C4917E8853394E1A8E90EB0
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x1A8D50006DD93874EDAD85BC8913C85A
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0xBDB95EFC74B142246150A03528B8B917
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0x0683392542813CD2C3602F30CFD35B26
performed."
0x3D84F7F89198C7A46AF455C3CD74626C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x3A33989FC5C205626D7365A1F1865C1B
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0xE95C1919F77DBDC522A45E688C1D16DB
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0xCA7F1023F929F2FA05170C09CF12C4CC
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x3274F7199587869928EF10AF0AB01E19

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x8358FEBDD75C2144CAFE18CD8161E2E4
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0xE4C05A35FCCAF8DCBF4AC6C806C3AFD7
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0xFE4CC5588A478F9A9C61EF08D998A554
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x20B8E120D4CC1B48D824E6EA219F6406
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0x4A8881C7EEC3348DBE7CC9F75E16EBED
mind to do."
0x973C13885F8AB0CC0838E01A994D4FBA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x61F31FBAA255628F45E75DE02510A12E
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xF88341A859F41A510978083D9B037F7E
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x3A1FD08A36DE54E65F4969657318D271

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0x6C7B5047FBAB49F99446192021201FE6
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0x71FCA29B98E8617A9AD38B77DBD04239
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0x0D467CDC4A470E6BEEA6642B1AA661F3
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x14D02C2DEAFCCC6EEF87AC0808EA4B16
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x6C0AFD16C2D15EF3BA249FC6FCCC4FAB
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0x3D66E3CC2AEAF502B7359586AEBF4820

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x845CFEB66EF5A1A935F5B9C767B0106D
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x2F437B6BA1BBF7080FEF72B718108DD0
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x12E25ABD88C972C90C2A0518DE3EAA02
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0x2E7EDD2768788E3268848471A52376E3
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x55D925373871B356FB01915750E63B95
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x48DEAE6301209BC085B9BDE2B5068C93
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xF67A60391E91A6FC7BD687F225600DA0
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xF8476C170D546B9B37F5CF0196D79720
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0xD1DBB3F4010EBE804E4A2808A8F05EE1
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x87EB306411E631AEBD778A1859625DC7
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x18D7DA9CE33E6288D03753D5A30A6CB7
feeling.
0xF161110467042B32D34FD120598EA4D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x6E7F46E7FA236B9E66CF3C23160CE39E
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0xEA5B9E599F169157F7D0AA24FB031BDE
fastened on his physiognomy.
0xE6B361C1AAAB8F0BB3FAD7D63EB06678

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0xC124601562932C472AE95359ABF3A17D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x0B2C565E6A39C86C275DFDDBD69E1E79
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0xF673A522E659A72C06A6A0CA8FE64B12
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x595A965279470E0CD41A7F4E53661413

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x9F4C76D18265DE9CD8C00EFD44FE945F
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0x846D29CD22451335ABECE811B540C6C5
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x22E762054750FF868CE7ADC90883DB2C
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0xEB2BD5294F9EE005C1CB9F0F72F5E159
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x92CA3B800122066F841A3E4224A73372
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x98809F9411A16D7F78A38F46C774D7F7
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0x8A639727173204259E3AC0309D1ADEF5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0xACEDDD58973095DA2C77C15EB35B3ABD
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x34EB65D2CE0A68FB2C30E6305D35DEA0
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xB0DCECC02AE77F6F24FC40BCC7572B2D
consequence, or something of that sort."
0xF5BB6FF1276B410654429A4E775F6EB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0x71E1DEB4E0196119B667F62BF88E3677
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x57928E27697F9BE7329D4BF35A41398F
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0xF22770EC12DC34257A1E7A3C0257C6AE
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x299AF002C9CABA963FC78C35FA340322
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0x3A0C485C56C0C696D4B6D413FEFC7931

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0x45ED9445AC106A5BF57ABCE471F33F02
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0x758D1E102066AE0D4AA9F46152A1DE30

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0xEA1E471F7EDBF6D357047AA2381E4F86
does my forehead not please you?"
0xB2DE41BD7441A2FB87E8B0CC57FB2124

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x6B22B9DFC0D2377B21ED266540067D38
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x9C08A800EBA62CFA1649F3C4DE8E1C34
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x04CA7C1D7E33AF26F135898B22644CAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x7E86361C70146A8EC6A19AEB9AC2E754

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x716344331B475DB3A872AA493F8FDC79
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x517670943F60B8814BD6B7582D7AEF4C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0x8A820665C8CBCFD5591C182A3F7A2AB4
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xD3899C05017B30C52E636FB9751A650C
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x2DE7811FB0F7E9936804A99158BD9C51
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x33D9712E92E28786A7B24C174569232F
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xF37A2A5650E565FC00655AD939FD05BF
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x85EACC997B535B99F512CE743353DC12
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0x1A32D6673EF0347D5936D74E5082C5D0
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0xFE5BCBEAC8F228E56AD22BB566EC7D8C
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0xC990CBEA569623B06DEB835DAE53930A
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0xE91E6AF6B2088E2C247E55D64BA1ECF0
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x05CADCCA86F13EC980C7E62791136245
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x0DA6C1D9BA148B3EA05ED8CC6A2E0924
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0xF3F3751166E8EA4AADCE8F6D6D403C97
me?"
0xAC1D2F157969B8C351CA6192B9CB1CF4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hope of what, sir?"
0xD2C2740E15388DD31976214A3159B290

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x99191704D5AA8531D60C9B6095903AF4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0xBA3E0EB3A28515D793CCD7F011CA2C15
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x780C6C17907CFC0ED7E3BB073ED8F7D3
capable of being re-transformed?
0xEE467A2DC857D732639A825F67836347

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x4ABEC49A39CD33A7C72D158565906A6F
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0xB784E464429DF90BB532783FFF61C08B
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0xCFCB4008ABEDC7A88442356CC2514BBF
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0xE89327BCBA680CAD787A45FD0AA1550C
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x9C6E2159C78AC858E1A0604F6F7610FB
to-night."
0x4CBEB891344B4720078CE31E5788FA59

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x575E08008CCC212AB04259EB555B6C37
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0xEAA79E51CD487741A344C9611FEFF4C8
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0xA5D7C33D426D4CC13919B8FD2197C098
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0xA90EEB359B3D49D70C979292671F2440
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x9B27F7838852F84C19444BB3A4EE340F
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x16CF5F411F059639BEDF231ADFA8EEFF
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x293D01C4A2FB81F44321854FC44ED34D
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0x5DE883E31C72B97DAED7D03B5C67F296
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x2E9175EC329A4B678FEB22D9703B4CFB
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x80F6DC1C44D6EB73B176594FD7680FB4
confidence.
0xB08552BAB14CE5A916641FB34B2541C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0xFEAFA8407378719B5D184C5055576B80
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0xE9C7E8B4AF96072429028480B8ABAB8E
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xFDC538722F7F867738D74D140BEA2BA9
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x5B8B139883EE2C51EEEAF8D042CE2539
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x7921D1B5BAAE4E7EF008EDFDA27F4E09
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x73BB39ADF3CD4B05BE85CF16C97287AF
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x9DC98D04063FDE0E4C4A56DD1869C8C3
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0x1C9E2C3CDCE85CC1C81B1B7DD26FC434
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0x237A304AB21EB9249133779C7E13EDB7
you--therefore speak."
0x8A94A0E0D3F24007A91A2C252C73C0C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x92F96DA8259321154E908E54F898E6C7
smile either.
0x69C79022BE3CCAF572DBCC06B3B27F29

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Speak," he urged.
0x2AF66FB32A183551376D440D1010482F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What about, sir?"
0xB0E001FDCF5E78599572AE5A8B164571

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0x7A5FA811F865F5CF453563242C155CEA
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x27ACBFB5F026E43B6850BAE862811A92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0x4F23A3C9A78724CD41EF671ABCFE55D2
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xC3590BCC7A1CD6A31DBF6AC0641DBCEF
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xF743B25C8C7FC88D7BCC39A20295CDED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0x9105659643BB7B6E38D4768B1D678C23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xA0C883FB95B74047044E0302FF6C0328
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0x6424DF73DC53360919BB0EA1AA92186D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0xC6DBC67B5F085DB8A59B7985D1B355C2
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x7828F923E5B79A58856F59E8D59327FF
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x3DC1C66539572C6C96B55550F8BF2BD2
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xE2040BE6E4E4876B90D873A9A477FF3F
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x1F78025F066BD4580C7192EB85F830EB
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xF3859642162B41DC82CEAF4062DB3BB2
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x9B23FBFE777D456259B33FB479DC194F
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xD277A4E4FB8F79F151C9889689B6C55A
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x2464D4420A47661BADA7428D7A4EF5D7
rusty nail."
0x7504EC2721F22C5683157C3F1354800F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x008C3A96C53F7E209DB9C45C44D217FC
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x265EA3D1B1FF73C304AD001DAAEECB86

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0x14608DFBE87361108C148D60562D49DB
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0xFE4C98491E2F3C69A6DD0A6217E3B9C2
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x460EF1CB8571ED7AAECDA20884943F67
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x03DB67B7534AF7A11804F82470C5F97C
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x1D8BB120621CB17A62C51B8D9CFECF19
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0xE7045EFCBD58285658DFA172008DFBB7
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x543C6BD9FCC6D13F8D0DA0CDF81902A8
people in one house?"
0x8D552B3F9A1B02B676DE880F31505C6C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x8150F07684A702530A25D8493F8DB1E5
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x538633CFE010FBEAFFEF24553A541FC7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0x2042E950B52FD7341C8306A74A20B1C7
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0xB2A8BF7217A4B7A3A0D1EDAB13B82F76
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x67BBF79A141D7231DD0931D43C7F5F36
and experience."
0xC257E82DC08D1F21B241A5D5D55A50BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0xD479AD7FFF1A560DD18E2F3124BB324A
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0x04831D584E686D11F8865D0B0DA9D582
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0x152538E96A568C0EE01F19932CFD9540
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0xE78826ADE6FE5E1806F57922F6DAE961
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0xA9EBB6268BDD30A694598DBC1379BBE7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0x165B2719F1A9E94FC10254A5008FFB11
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0x8B646E2EA4DFBCCE0DF7C4634686A8B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xA7F951A47C11DE10C515A151E9DF142A
expression; "but speak too."
0x0347A3CAAC0BECE5791150B0A7A1A186

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0xF0D0551493D76C35FDD28322F23BEEE7
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0x95F3C5DFBB4C2CF6DB9882FDCEB2CF55
their orders."

"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xCA4786A3C4318E7DC9E59137A41F879B
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x0F60B64FF6F4AC20F73CBD81529D58E9
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0xFDE2DEAFC24AB36C8FCC4F9D29BCB491

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x1265016A6F7B45F1096BB4DC6C614B3D
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0x44E0DF2740BFDA4BC257EB5C043C3889

"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x837FBB892A6B7238EC8A2582C5AC186C
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0x32A68C3A4630B6BEAF3811D32220F47A
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a

salary."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x7F85AFFBD074396897AA3288D8CED9F9
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0x563AF79E096BEBCAD59AC1EE25508135
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0x5B46AE2768FE9A728A39BF4DEE9EE263
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0xADAB5F08CAD366CA52B3C45B5CD37937
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0xA820218B0579A905CCB1C354BAD8DE90
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x6B9EE607B847DE4B3438995566ABC5AF
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x21C1D8AF10D7455296C6907D4CBE1039
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0x94EEB6E3AC9342DF072212416A32FD27
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0xB3E859E5E2C6033CADF514FE928EF503
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x52BF1CE5F8CE761793770303C6061BE7
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x96B7873936DDDEF19DD9BEB60641FBB5
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x5C205DA94328FA9ABD47D2625103D756
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x46FA8D9D80C55D123337833F490D6213
defects to counterbalance your few good points."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x15D5C30821B748E59B323E59D88A43E0
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0xA6C9F3A02F876A9B0990DDF77CEDE3D9
as well as imagined--
0x208BFAE178C27323566F8FBA731532F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x220045BA6821F33E793D8BE131350C0B
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x1F648C9A87F80E3471F7D1FA10B7D0DC
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0x45848E4A5D5B46E1C40D4A1851CAED6E
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x8DB3707F644207D352FD8CC361F5B7D7
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0x3EDC18188C292D65C965981620D3C74A
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0xCA1645CEDC5E179DB0D311887A9AF751
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x565278225FBE4FB4B365566EECD1F933
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0xBE36EE23E5F6A397D095ECD0D52881CD
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0xBFDAAA97213FD05A3F16EFDD5FDAC530
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x667A100CA85069EDE2CC54F64128A9DA
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x8087EF9E99121165B9CCC856D461E7BD
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0x203FFADF141A01B5C6064A20E47DD32F
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0x646F6191A1AF4E44F0C6479BE8BBA794

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0xACD7C2274FEE9AD155F90E9DDEA809AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x3FF01FA8D00F028F23C6188A88A5FBCF
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x4976E86AD3093B683E6559C09CE8C05C
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0xABDA7147DF32EE276928988952E518E0
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0xCF27C48E7C7FED8815BB903371EC8B4E
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xCECDD7A0D4D8A9C3C130D986DEEA02FC
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x80718404560E86673E413E22EDDAEB03
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0xC119F3B55B3D9065D18332F9DF019466
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0xE74CFF8A9EAC520DE7A530911359F1D0
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0xEA348EC97F7A27C1E4033D6D63D3A7C4
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0x313E1BB7FF73772CD90A07260E9CF543
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x1E6937255B1E10D8BAE32488AACB6BB9
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xC5011D345ECF353F65C87C06894B6E90
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0x6B79BF9C5FED8D7346D650D9569E80B6
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0xAF167E51CBD2C7505E5621FA1F9221D8
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0xB6AAFA562F3367661A67A4C1B00EFC8F
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x8CEB2EE635E3C3475F67F1010AEC108D
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xC518B563C32C24394B84D8FC7E97C359
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
0x39565BC4B89B7032E40D7D5AA58A49A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were

writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
0x4DA27AC78DC51EA55FEAA1344661FD33
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0x6D26D7EBDCBE7E96586EBD3A7B0A4C48
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x43E241CE650BFB0AA613627E9B8D6A14
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
0xEDCFF4369D3083C7AD723999566D162C
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
0x9823E1750E09AC6E2FEB212135B73AC0
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I

wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are

tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."

have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
0x19B2C686263EB9F50A3BE36C423EB193
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
0x6D47719A2EB536EED52B1495845AAF9E
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I

"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
0x4724807D83580C0CBEF4C25D6770A81A
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
0xAEDD74A3A06D3E43F89D71A10FEDB6CA
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
0x0C3B8C332B86720307E9134E7DBC102B
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
0xF96A991DB0D5C8166790AB9328537D0F

disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my

know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
0xD7CE706FF6B10C96DB0534E5FF3079CB
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
0x38D1C3547A319513253BC143B2F04281
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
0x7159AADD45DBFFAF3F54093A980795C6
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
0x747FC46D6281FA8B2AD8F0917436F28E
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
0xB787304BEBB1353AD6F0C0B92B736698
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in

that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at

The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your

features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
0x26BFF51B05A50DA2B9EC7B5B59C7F01D
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
0xEACBF838A5007ADA768EA1196D4E73B2

impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements

watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious

0xF04FF97D81554B5478B65E461543D4AA
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il

out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
0x72A5DDAC52584279FF19F8099805300E
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
0x49A746847DAA56F4E26E09325DD1B5EF
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the

0x7713684CE9213E141EBEE1A770A5E803
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it

will be realised."

Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She

entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
0xA3EAAC130B309B2F5BB1E118E72AF2CD
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
0x392A229172D181DD8BE19E81E81BF71C
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
0x5F8217FA28724726A2BBE2DC590C885C
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
0x02CBD0DAF0546ECBB837A35EAA916D4B
and small white satin sandals.
0x1E1466BD5CC3CD5AEFABE526D49F85B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"

And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having

reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,

then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x937D64980B2E07EE58F53BA1E80F2586
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"

Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once

freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0xE3385CE13A2832BA5F78CCB6A56437DB
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not

valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x2624C9DF101DDC895653E756A06BA8AE
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the

Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0xC87D38919A0D2C0EB0EF3217E6FAAD25
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while

she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and

down a long beech avenue within sight of her.

Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x5F95813F35676BBC90B2034CEB194809
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0xF4271AFCAD904E717BEC24AC4ED5FAEE
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x270F027FD0109940031F45206E9CCB6B
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x4D8C4D74E8947DBD8A2899B56518D8BD
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0x4C6EE62F783FF79289C15F1659FCCEAA

"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x32B419872D094280265FBEBD01BE86A7
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x779A443AA2BF887114CB20E09F936E4D
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0x1AAA0C6A2F0E6CC8AAA1E7702897577F
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x373FB938D5BA7F036BCF8DA7D8075438
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xCC6AEF2D8D7C13709FE137FB6653BDC3
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x1EBBEFE3DB68180C79BAEB05283539CB
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x76F5B87A72201E892EF67B81B116D53D
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0x5548EF9F049708E7F2659A3C64AF5461
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x9954D75388F18B59A994F4EA1F3314A2
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0xA211E22F3CC85C7E6E8C280A6F99184F
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x779E4EFDD02090D6C7EE446B999E5D01
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x94E1CD409D65F913E0C8FD1B72DEBF84
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x7D45AB03FE417238D6103A79ED20733C
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xAD57A1CFC03CCC3DE75B0A2AA32AAFB6
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x18E88DED2D753627B07A53CC826B1341
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x303AA392F8ACCE519C92CE2E7300DC3F
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x043EF421ABD9A9E25FFDDA0BF8CB6945
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xBC80870C9063D0A99960BF64FD3C41CF
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x542C0D88EC180FB8EA8D09210B15D071
now, if you will excuse me."
0xC5126AA84DE213C499C14E40FD105B6B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0xB77BC9E41E0CF8778D8995342D6A3839
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x09DA9BE572036C98FF5763E6B99E8456
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0xE8EC9D25F54CEEA44394B889D470289A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x9AA1DA85767056FC751199B7A4F39933
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x9A07CCA46AE874EC3A05CD77C0DDD032
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xC342BEFACB4809CD127ADA9475D683AE
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x6F31DA585F0D877D78D603E2507E55D2
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0xCF32C602DFBDC9BA7425EC13F1F5B684
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0xD70C0C56FA052F87C0700751AB20407F
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0xE0AA933532D75FE53FD3E4B2FE3A996B
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xCBA432438EACDCCF83E3BB3F7B88A691
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xEE6A01480E83783CDB3D1CD86F5B5C92
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xAA12C82418727615DFFC5C540315711F
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0xEE0FCDE136784D3F4E3BD80331EB331B
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x5FC6CBA6A4F39F0D8EE30F424229C66C
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x52A8D2AF6DE9D47F095C38BFA9A4BF73
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0x6ECB4C8B3007C44664CC434448B34CF4
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0x9DD236832A53A2F2A520555CFAE213E2
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xFD54E689666E389D928CCA9E1FBF3825
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x3A1F0887DB78116ED5615F1CAFEBC886
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x1F031713C9DEEC55E98FDF542E011DBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0xE84FA976BB465F421F5D39887C78388C
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x6B6F255239C2C1B2D85439C27882AEE6
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xF9FD2A7D60A8A36B7CD059C19D895016
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x1D5E8F0DCC100CCFE6295DFD5AAFB5BC
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xBB9AE7F2EE36C0D1EDED5B888793EFAC
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x8F2B23E0641F6798C60849E5549A3ACC
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x816504039738F868D2AB2CC67975F8F9
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x6E21319CC7D9623F592DE35D2EEA6F67
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0xD3DA0F4ACBC1F493861E52285010F16A
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x9951520340A2DA936511FBD41F340C4C
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0x4008F5BE39343767D1D876D71D9B5731
current--as I am now.

"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0xC0B6BDDFB586295DEC8BB8440C8DB3FE
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xE7B21079746B592A09F03AE7A22E5B2E
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x08FE06CFCBF30B41AE98A2EB08606B1D
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0xE4B69345601942482C7B903896AF28C1
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x75ABE080BAE3776211321ACDA9B0AA3C
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0x8980A6355A0A6292342492988C417B08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x4C3CBF39FAC292FFC4EBCC79D7E5D59C
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0xE923BF879CBEB2D20B8479919003CC6A
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xD3538E6ECBD4E560604B35D1E905DF7D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0xA0F018D8E9DB50FD7FCBC8774122971D
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x7ADF56218D4B1953BD7DC469B89152B3
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x147E6636E6BB6CE9165D36AB0664130B
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x3F3330B43A39416CCC6CBE06EFEE64F1
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x98DC2FEFF624FE769E194CCA32FB8326
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x5A7F2E634541C78797FE76D0AC822C13
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0xFE295317FA283736980455FC3C4442C8
his countenance: he went on--
0x7D9899AFF39D9CF6D56EE7144B063D9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x7E42978DC2C2E0E9EA57BCC2FE8220F0
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x18EFD367EB12E942538A2E22B8ED27F7
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x2DD0CDFE0152FC73FDC5DD82A2C0CE01
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0x7BACA4C06F221B10A3D7D4A1594D8D5D
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0xA24EA3AA596EBB8139C359EDC3B2C426
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x894719383151A0E519F9AE20ED39B3D8
if you dare!'
0xD2A7386A2CB80422D8190D7BC81AFC5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x9C1BF11B3C87580C023A388AD413299B
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x8AA506BDD12B47CD1588533427B1B76F
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x77B3361CE0285966FA0F56F617253571
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x3097628AB15D202FC5B9FF7A3A6531F8
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xB93CF5117EB72522955FE996F1FAAFE3
but straw and rotten wood."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x08A0DE1D43E5107248CF0B1B76AF2DF4
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x76AAD819AB6C2F449D0E99980D2809E4
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0x153341A1DA618C09B3BD4AC7E2089612
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xE5A8F6669E1BAF76A6B2000BE00DD250

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x50A0C000F51AB6BFBBF7FB404E73AA77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x22D30103120AF6946159C75C8367C949
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0xCF676A4FA31E2188F8414949479C0210
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0x43CDA778832A39B5EFBC139B67012CF6
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xDC9F875CA7A616E18530909CE59AB5B2
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xB367057181BF3FCF24CAC15D4ADB1853
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x8C1B68443423306BF4FB6664BC58923F
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0xFEBCF0FFAEDE58E5336B5786345F253C
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x667F85706B58F7FDD79332C78B299303
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x7861E20ACB1637D264B46AF90204DD47
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xB0303774D61E56AFAB8B4CB2911E8182
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0xDD49BED262784119DDEB8260EBD67BED
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x78EEC3F45C3A7576501828DD5A81A368
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0xBDEACF1148C2E6A09C388D92CA05F1AB
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xD65B866971A82671517163323CCFAB91
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x23C1251FDCA2AD6F4B6B1BAE39A6F034
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x1C097D4B0A6F56155C5B6FC4EDE138D5
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x239116FE4606165E7477EEC6DEA6622F
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0xEA5B944DD01539A5D2DB5740D13D04E6
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x8E9BDAC4CB972273BA3DA6172CF7F918
After this digression he proceeded--
0xA1BAA8B75734879877026CA79035F347

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x9B4DBA8C23657C73494BD5B07BBBB1AF
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0x990E4833BDD095EDB68C7F11E36DD97D
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0x6C5F03CA9304620CE579199DCE211B30
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0xADF3324D10AB9BF41C548E596C746484
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xD396C1339496032333E6B1F4BE1B9424
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x21DA45347D56B908F5E5A69F78BD500C
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x52EDD1B2D47C69B7545A0E450B27D554
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xBE65712D646C0CDC799BEF06201DB810
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x4288892903BCDB398C574ACFAB177015
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x1BA8EF5F96D7E8DE32551C42F915CD02
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x5C50003E11B87AA8D7D432D436B081FE
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xCDD0D70D27607DF1B6271E9E60060C09
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x338B01462EF2AE098126C28EE7ACB63B
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0x2D39F01C328BD8B60F268CA95211DA1F
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0xD45032F355F9ABB081F5A9E68D80F539
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0xFA85B5ED4269AE5170C32C9DF3DA22DF
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xEDCD12091D9498EB962C3336AD049ABC
who had been her dupe.
0xDE123E84DE277186D14724E3C9483B73

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0x910DA35651670DA499376D00F99A473A
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x481C94FE968DD521D399CDA8376D89D9
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0xCC1BB595FF39B1E03528AC22BF6E3FD9
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0xC38A4D3A72951CD1CFE8D392AF11DAF4
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x4B0064B7307BFB0E93ACBBF905A12483
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xDA25CCC3CC1D99422188E08404A3BA77
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x296E5EF0F13B0E16D1B57CC8D4D0E4C1
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0x01ECC423471751CAF7A47B3C1854AEE6
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x273F69CAA60FBDC61D81446291FCDA28
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x10CA25DAD3A864C06CA5EC116EC14D31
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and

wishes to see you."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0xC10B5F337E91B9242CEB3265BBCE2486
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x94C0E1F877C89E6BF0EE69A9DEC3F6C7
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x51D49F87B737D84709040420C5D19CF1
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xC941F6220AAD10D3F15B59CDE35A00BB
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xF4A8975A94E01BD6898608C7D507E2CB
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x1D6884B012E4833AEAF54AB6C922B3BE
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x8ABB9131B6717D92569C2501E633374F
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xE2A8D2767A4150E2E497E175D5186681
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x05B8E20C4B65856A4508FBE31B1C67A8
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0xC07E15F3FB25B7097672A6990900A5BC
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0x8B4B5E8A3AE9EF9F25407B53739BEE97
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x391CD8871E699D211A49AD9141433310
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x3F1BBB0A7AE53034FAE5DB702B5AC1EB
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0xD4A9C0B5F0289712EE59750526550DA9
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x2625D80FD463F100022161F789F1301E
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x7C2EE7FD389A1BC86356524FB3F16FB8
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x255CD2ED4298E58011081A83D7F29A81
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0xBE98CF67CAD23A60B140E1B8D1BEC67A
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0x769961CCAFAA00D6C75D212470B40DA9
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0xF59EC9442D2472053327FE8F9F168344
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x7C2F51342B3413ABE824E7213186AB60
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0xCC33E7EC612DBAAD0F71EF391CB517C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0xECF38ABAB688F61B00E666FB9E4D7E63
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0x84DBF7A833A4CC65FA8D389BDB65DBAD
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x97509F5454EF6873E39CC2646491C7C0
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xEAD8699E99CDC5FD63DD3E95B01587C2
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x96094B9EE7D9492FA49ADC57279E69F6
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0xC9330BA89219DA13CE938DE95D4DD52A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x8EE23966576F6D76E16DB2A79E28D6EC
you too: it darkens."
0x24FC4960A1703A654B477A7BEB601C43

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xCF0FC75B41EBB3A14D27EC55D16EE339
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x25D8617CC33AF556485DBC952930E109
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0xF51335C8E0124B759BA843515B302D1F
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x8E450E5A118BD59414EF0C47CE9D4AF4
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xBFFD46F27476885E75E7B83B4EB70BC5
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x5A40CA6C21AA38F2836D912E747439E7
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x92B0605AC299776AA5779A5EAFC597BC
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x6BDA17988421148FD0DC0364C9A45950
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xE1CD1B8901544E84BE7DE80E82A8FAC1
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xCFE045D32F4BD01E4EC53BDF3234EE37
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0xF1E329AEFDBE9D094880E9A8A682E130
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x738FC6D1EF83B0F310BB18D4169E7069

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x10C75800700567658F514E0676D47EA5
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x5A90E94967F1B04F755D061461C7C211
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0xC614D5231242FBB21C5312B78F825DC0
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x1FF0D401C850585D2EDAD5426D28AA6D
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x3FA4ACE8CED1A30C7C744A1D84A31B44
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x24429340256087B102BC2F620208539A
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x6B326B66C9909ADF0FD58EC989753B51
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x59D44877716BE3139E8A223B9DB48A36
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0x5655555A4188B9210F954054845C4754
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x77BC45164D6680DCBC51874F15FA47D4
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0xBBA82D4385364B334EA75988D3CC5C0F
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0xA727E2C8CDF8F3D0F8FDAB2FC4E95128
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0x668636E3E50A264FFCFDC74057C688EE
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x4D5DEA21BB7CC14980801DA7EE308FD4
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x11814D1835F50227E4843AF1E628BC32
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x05B03A2318E7720A59C7BB5C4C422183
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0xA2F22A14D8A4B2ED2F0283D83B13765B
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x61DE799DF80BE50725864C4DA7542698
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x703D1673A9445CFF4E0E53050B4A8099
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x596DCE27009E21FB9D569FD6C25F9384
benefit.
0x01A56A70257F1B2F22E366E9F8CD2479

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0xCEED75EBEA3EBE59167A76B2C5FA1AD4
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0xA1B69D652517D326A09F96048977C4C1
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0xF45DD23CECED7A33CFA0D33B6077CDE1
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xD65EDD5A738F7FEC35B9B4035AE33DF1
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x88817584FBE642426788737795D1B24B
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0x17686ECC36F67A3838FB148B046F8EE0
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0xED4CF9D010DC3584A5FC6D79617457A8
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0x776905ADB52C530382D4633462E75D85
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x4D77D356501551A24F1F1AF7B2A6AFE5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0xF8D6BD7B8A683A056B9F0A289CD08E6E
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0xAA5ED3A2DEC73341B6DFEA817503A7EC
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0xB82ECADE78892848878D2F57A478DEC8
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0xB7DB841685679577E2BBE685CCE6B393
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xCCD34FA2D1BE7ED7BA2245A9E33F395E
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x8D2E13979193CF2C0B134C763B35876C
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0x6DD659C8962A607B4B93DD6FE30F579E
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x1F9383CBCCAC99C0AB6E6A08878B6080

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0xA9856979ABCAB90C636BED88E5E9E00D
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x8EB6A082609D738B0AEC0DD812D06067
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xE3132D57C2D8D985324B3B9C0A41A492
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x632097359C6C054B17995ACA21098DE2
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xBD39C5AEA9CC01FA9B4B1233B6B0BD09
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x71547DFA02EA8D39C00A962E15D78165
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0xF4F643EDE6B51B7FF998E17E8CE3DA9E
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x965946602BCEABA66168D806ED84F26A
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xA76E1DE85ABF386F15C2749B95F7A3C2
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x98931934861847029A15B5859872C292
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0x74EC40AE70A365C5A11B49621EB4065B
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x3DA21C3C8A3E581026B4DA68798CB977
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x315A6B3FB2CF288423E5A31421027645
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x6D67A1EEE82C75CDA37D88210CB79B32
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x15C243491261BA839137CD3571CDE0BE
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0x2F3BE4B65533E67490BAE0E12DB22C04
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0xB0471D092A2A8EC24D4EE7204DBD55CA
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x60A0C50679069491F061B7720F4C04C2
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0x482036A4103F7ACEE8EAA9475D7979D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x58F5F780E88714913C097A8C4F742A4C
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xE3AC181E13055951287DF509058FAC52
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xE755311DE4DB86BC511D918DCB6030BC
Thornfield.
0x6D208C72B11A5989306C8466C1ED3D1D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x6683908D0379E828C6C8823669D56496
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x6D66E4DA402860213E4DBA1C2EF99702
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x9D3FEC26249FCB4021ECED5D5C7763C1
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0xAE6D2473696774343D1002DBAE73F6BB
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x703F2D5B6139C206961E202257BD889A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0xB2F44F319A2C603C70565A000616D48A
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x6D5A49CEB29EBAD26B03C8F1AB63B033
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0x1F10BFB53E2A22E4046671AECC9F392F
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x179768317ED534B02AF2F81FB2E6B5EF
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0xEDA5F3F5DC224B1384E8D9482921BBB8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x51C7E8697E9602B6605C1385BF18A179
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0xE6E73942791342C01FFE4F0EB0759BEA
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x6894DF7705157F79CF214738FEE43BD2
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x23C51D0EB761A245DECFC439EA27D7CD
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x5856B30705A3D7ECFB1BCD87297078CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0x382BC2A03B275D48AA2D806EC6967A7C
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0xB38959B383808F04B7B13BCDF16F07DE
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0xD63B0709B66192B8DA0B97B955929F22
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x6F2B7FEE7AFD44DC57E392105062BECC
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0x3642ECFCAA22708F0F0BA76333EC693C
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0x9DEC113F53F58F71C06A3D6618DA615E
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0x92D278D00CAA932B36D15A9C012D8DE7
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x7A1C5B51295D4063C19B92267DB5DADB
enough.
0x0F1A67EB318CC50547E0F68B15D5B919

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x1689C36BA45173C61BF9DD0DD4807B13
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x4DFAAE7E4766BFFAD813C1745126C07A
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x99DA225B7354113DB2950E6A54A77F28
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x6EAEE7E76F7B8F0FDF9201261AD580E1
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0xCE6CF22697C76F9EB4C8A193B772D9F7
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0x5B8FA59447034C9E574F068F7834319B
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0x2D6F64B8AB4A60A2A265CDDD70F54AA6
there?"
0x85E766337CCE694EC7E6AFB55E2C7721

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x68A4D60593EA770393708FB938BD2274
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x83A10764DBD3D04A8744FEC079FCFA18
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x0CC4F3212E5F8031361E36E4D213E209

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x1513E439B982420D2715534CA82227D4
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0xC30F544B864A5D4AF2F99FDD164561E2
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x59334D16D4EF00B47AECCBED0F598D95
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x52C745EB026094D765607503E89484CA
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x777DF8B9A82678DCC0D8FE2124F2B260
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xEE3402E079DF2D120B8300A030ED91B6
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0xFBC121D50321CA425BDFB266CC2B3D80
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0xBBAAE6EEE5E2F73F9B8CFEB1E0B7DC25
burning.
0x848B7FD3B5FD708017998FCA246F923B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0xC07282B0F5515B620F70F6A866374A91
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0xC5265860661678ACD5D74E1CEF3CC8EC
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x5CDA75F005BB8433D46490EE2357AA1B
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0xB2A797D0BA889580AB84E19F7BE1DD08
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0xF5B774E04C4F20DF4452E38282508AF0
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x74A2B0F946F802C12DCE0DCB58249633
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0xAB9BE23105B20E8DABE901F22521E4DC
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0x2749BBA225EA92A50C968DC6B305E570
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x6FAB77A40AF8406214D405044799A6C7
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0x1E47F1D958722B4A3C5CAAD4904BC241
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x616C445D845FA961C8E0DFFEAEDDB939
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x5808C6DB763B1EFA6E3610F0571CF555

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x9844760EA28F34D6BCB4733CE9334288
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0x4A6546C8293A7D93C028699A8D05C88E
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xC7E7E1B9C59FC52E7FE954C76E32B043
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xFFBFCCB6876F5B0FB1356FF26757C2FC
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0x28290A8E3C8A4A2B1FB68705AC2D0169
water.
0xBCF38E0FE8D2B7BECC23B2CDECD3F0B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x7A19371E4714F15A0FF6B0AFCE80E825

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0xE5A71D65F033B14006A4BC772E410A8E
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x0BC5FC1558398DAC5E1DB233648185F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x1CED768DB10B218F4418F40111A04B9B
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0xE9169476605DB9399592748608DBF75B
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x7452508D391645CB6A79EA2C73341FAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x5D59B525079C2E8ED4CF97549A1E8179
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x4BF75A67C467B2546AC8817C19E9580D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x53BFA695B671FDBF54DC71E386BAF962
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x9B928DB3E54322A7F572327FB46BD452
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0xED96ACD40449BBA1BFFB428D3F928837

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x5BB153B0D7C33968DBC03AE54B42E6AA
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x0ACFBC9F1A93E4E19FC08C187937DAA3
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0x38488154522B238412E3747E53C9D425

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x34D50C29A2D306E87C4F876E2914414B
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x07CAD1FE94BC731B40092883318501E3
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x004FF955BC04A67B0C4C54BB8E008C6E
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x49A4DCE5F1A3B30806BC3E5CA397BB63
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0x1D4E0D6FFA3C3DCB524EE5B18EA26F53

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xDC864F9D12CB4447651751E2B8973D81

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x519A9743BCF719512C1C45E9C1085450
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0x0416C4CB4139B54A4EC83661203A89A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x5EE5AE41BFA43E8E3776775A07777AB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x2D51B527AF4A463BB1BACC3DD369321D
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x1D54680B61958F73D8EF20A23B227390

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xADFC627D015DA24665D3CBD2E34AA2DB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xF43A6D20053F5E26DA287E731D8325BE
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x08C8D8002AC0DEEFFECA57CC7CB75034
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x754D142E876C4953A27E7DDE5B6DC606
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0x5C755456036BF83994FA2ECC997676AC
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x977FF428AC205F0389CF990EA8C74C65
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x0A22EC97598EDAFC4B0E263C90CE9F64
move, remember, or call any one."
0x984C73823A8D3B75115C4647C42F36FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0xD066F7F52F2369AB92B93F1AB7C164B4
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0xAB05C2A0A7440E6C02F48B105D1068A1
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xDB270341C9AFC9A5698DEB25278307A4
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x19264D9CD59888A70046A28F0374D4E2
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x9E1F11EF2488314EFCC799098EED19C2
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x2DBDD9B893EB206D692BB742FFAE5385
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xBB94646DC533D9A8A421D02B2478FE13
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x8B4DF16EAC3F413689A4C05380EBCB27
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x48B85A959D6C40940397B82B9705BCE6
"and not something worse."
0xBFC063353558962A84ED8BEBFDAA120A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x155081F713FB17FD914D3F58F3AEBF5B
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x419A23103560704B51B93A8673A322AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How, sir?"
0x707835337382EBDF097124F346D4B36A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0x366A7BDD3042FE12CCC112FC4EC8E516
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0x5B164B2650733785A8973EFEDEF5C955

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xB39AB91B965949906AE0DF9F95112E9B
door."
0x526198141BDFB8AD7DD87574FC7247F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0x0759D3119C164CF6ACE042BAEB94777F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xE06BE458CB1896F7660E8515F382E13D
think, or something like it?"
0x8D62BB09DEE76E2541ACA30A9C32CC1A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0xF420B536BAAD902A966B40EDFE3F9D63
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x3A7C3D17C057CA7520C46912960E032F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x8960B254471B566A0C4309693BFF0D9D
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x5A162421E49C795167650DF329554F43
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x4AFB5642BE14492763DB962DE8B66930
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0x719530071630F587B73B1E2C2757EBDB
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x2022CEB2B2BE2BBB6C4F294542575DCF
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x233EA301CABF0A236DBCEC7F2DF79056
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x8E633392708A150D846175D5B92146D0
hours the servants will be up."
0x691406010C995F9AA3E96A09CC2313A6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0xF4DEF146619FE6801610AEFB95F376DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0x9D5F1B083E0F278607D9A34DB94D9770
go.
0x3236368A25C23D3AD1FA5A1AD7CDE206

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0x1BC6CD7984957CB926AAC79F288A83FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You said I might go, sir."
0xB52E77153EE3E895CD0A052E2666CA4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x5D2CC2AD8CBE3C8E3877B6ACE5C9E5C5
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0xC19C3B9A74B269F3865E524C4B5E978E
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xD52F429D86F17472BD797D521C4E59E8
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xE64AB4BCB472F720F22AB45F6B7F189B
At least shake hands."
0x95087328CDCEB0461E49397C9D9A76F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xFFF984BC28CB35E7C57C77D56C412D74
both his own.
0x7C8B33FFEB15E93667521150BB58E78F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0x20A8F8D87D94DD2AE76D767AB391D13E
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x6D199F3B258F9BEDF7E01392B8E5ED73
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x6149BC49746BEBD73B36D9693F32327B
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0x1F21BCC407A03374366266C9F13C70A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x20A10E92E726597BEE19E29EFBC301D7
his voice was checked.
0x4416407886FC8F2A66249BD2C33CE0C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xF53C84518EA64C9778746CEDE2BD58C8
in the case."
0x48D9818EE2DF33CF260EF4CAFA8FED07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0x814A19DD578533BE75310EE07A59715E
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0x8EF6B8D7869DA77C663B0F82C2663027
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xE07DD85B5FC1D3390EEFC21A3A74EDCC
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xC67C8D65BCDEDBB8DFFA8DDE41E31B38
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x0610FFD2522F057188353798B7DA11E4
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x1C99C161DF1010E4CAD37C1EF3DF3E2F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0xBF665A4802A9C4C22BF836D0F4B98CD5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0x22F4DE464DA09AB5453386E2A46E6452

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What! you _will_ go?"
0xA139530EE2C52C47507073517907154C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am cold, sir."
0x8F749727A61B01EA29E0356AF387A4F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x2FD455103C264B465183890435840FA6
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x166588F443F6E6620693CEC02C79590C
expedient.
0xBE966EED8F29E2470E63E40E47A7B9F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x554E5C077C8C809CF3A8DA8E5E62A7AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0x9BB734E4C8BCABC3BFEC32048618E69B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x78FB39EE5D1BDBF6CC9D6FEA56A8DF8D
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0xC109EE43E882FC92A2EC534506800AF5
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xC4EFA237DEEB33A621FB19314182CE90
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x805FB966877C4E80AC3DBB9C58283B0E
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xFB3603271B83C93372BA4C0A01DD2320
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x6061477801A7C172FD9B92690B0F9C1B
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x91F41E34AAA0CA377E234F2FB4BA3DE6
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
0x463F3B4E3354B33CD9C349D8AF6445C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

CHAPTER XVI
0x3A73F51940D158900EFB065D8EF40653

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x5B5DCB24DE0DCC28FC3F72466B40824E
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xF8A17CC8AC1959EC5D17E2FE1D7B84C5
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0xD5F01B180ABA8B21F6C081814C91E3C7
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x6ECB99ACEE18815DE948D73327A7A56A
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0x4E1C93DD00F7F7A48970D36F7D73B494
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0x21F9D9E5442307BC542F607A1FE74A62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0x8440416800F50E29413D6DA560178BC5
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some

bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x2C40E042B8A05785ED6211A1146D0317
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x778230D9E75C2593D358FA3EC05FD532
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xB7946BCBCA545EE47999D16AE16F6BA4
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x8A2EEECE626B916FA64D8933053FDA3C
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xBF4EA8BEFFB99FFF936D0046CBAB3476
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xC01F0A951A3670B204083D15B4A99346
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x03DF24EF5C4331FBF52D4DCFED4DF727

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x0C464856FB7D36F4B9935B49FE16430A
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0xBFEBB097150B09CDF4617970B552460D
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xD24861B942C4978F72B0B29459D8A90D
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0xCF1DBFFB57A81AD272D9DAEACB7776F2
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0xFD37882036206D3DCC5D0FFA4FB6CAA9
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xD95B436914697F898428649C341DE3D8
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xE988B4AC59A6B52F7A3A17E1100D44CE
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x0F4485ABD7268DA750EB8F515833EED9
no other than Grace Poole.
0x7780DD4D3500CDF10D8507B67EE6A8AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0xD895CE0906B60A9E009DE38612A0FB6D
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0x5D5DB08FD87620E1D2D9259321DA3FB9
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0x76EDA77720C0D7E237B6439D7855F0A8
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0x81BFAAEEA1F2DFBE59880513BAEFF4D7
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0xA2772B6EEF23A67DB9E528C21001FE05
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x6239FAE1B328CF4881B3A0371A645D72
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x5C09DD53077E44B40254021F56343EA8
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x9F0976642BE623386DA22236B5BDEB06
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x40149CE357AD83C1250B4273DBD3E7B7
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x4A67F3211DF154E67C7E4B334F4E3B2A
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0x0FE30E18863604AEEC5EEB944420D6D9
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0xA9E647BC163AF6F584085F0F6E1DD8D9
went on with her sewing.
0xF5F29013E29B8DED42A2298D4E35BE08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x33307E92F8CEF13EF34BA115BE6F273C
is past comprehension."
0x448FC2A37003AA617709DAE1B1488DB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0x631614EE1FC75815606044A459B27933
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x5DD061499A3C264743B0DC445FAEF884

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0xC4432B08B48A790841E4F890B0496462
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xD205FD97DBABB4055D53500D7A0AAE86
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xE23FC37352714A369DB877BA2CA8410A
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0xDD46E378F284FAEFFF6F10169518CED4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0xB88CDBFA848146B07FB51018F930B117
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0xA6B4B190FF72CC58EB26C9A3C8D5BA4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x0FB3055B39BBC6656D51A30357ED5135
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x73D2B683590D7840917E4636B3350C9F
she answered--
0x0B8B5A19DEA16F9D8471DFDBE457EE5C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0xB7411A8E64A6384909E44847B6917C44
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xE85F5FA80ED7971F7965370E48B396EA
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0xE1A58EBA846C2F0AAE99D0CB7FF37CD8
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0x7B03488D12AA43803B7915ABEA115E08
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x8D23F90FCDA9B013B164B36BDEE7280D
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x1FF5A3BF1112DF2B7176FA86DBE08455
a noise?"
0x8AAA446C0167E110627DBC1F1576F24F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x9C8E45368E40CC191BEB5CC363F5EFF5
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0xD6054D00CE37E4038A12469F3495FDBA
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0x752B5CA0CFC1EDD17E6E6B32B4FB474E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0xFD1DB166FCEAF2E870B4EAC1561D2B05
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x7E08913E293CCBEDDCDE76AFB498F8E7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x59CBECE84E22D81EACDA2A874630A8AD
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0xDE9378DE2F39371B72FBE1D9C8D43B51

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x424C9CC10A58C5E8542DCC6EFD58C347
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0x1D42C8A75D6F0B3400FD8FF99356F972
conscious eye.
0x5B0B460447C00971B31CA68F5D496E5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0x70D269EB7FFD4E98D9F13AE5E96B170E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0x0179B145D02CCC102FBF6F4CF2BEB34D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x32B34F7AB68BC2AC45C24DE80C668313
gallery?" she further asked.
0xA139DA3712375B508B41EA6703AD0BEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0xD4D33B83FF938D29971FFB522DAC91F3
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x263AC751F3F6C2B2FC329F193A3215D4
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x5DAD34A3A2E657039231D4C87DAFAC53
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xC6DF03A7264A7BD9149712025F9EFD8E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0xCAA146B73A1B5BAE87FFC67E20A9F48A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0xD5D9BD7A7FC0C5BCB70E07422ECB9F65
you get into bed?"
0xCE7C1C9EB23441B679AC1107E1C3553B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0xC78A0FF7B0BC384F5E94B9C6C46C0744
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x18455B926D28928674E67F8C2286A524
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x501F2EDB0E845DD4673D6FB7D7173325
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0xB667D7370746C7600A6592756B90EB8D
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x8958FE587ED5EF3EC1898EFD2C9D859C
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x4490BFBB8DFF15D44E2249A262D4BE6B
lie down."
0xD779364D69560976BF908183CCD18726

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x25A81735332475546D4F98D6D6493DB4
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xCC3CB8D923816ABA88458EA6065523DB
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xD1423CAA0D49141298AFBFFC0326B41A
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0x2A565EE1B650B04BA1424640B0E4CC64
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0xC4AF808DD5652BCD80C1CD0BD4BF67F6
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0xD05AF81D35D81CF49A317CAAD3D805BB
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0xDFD0AABDC0E73E3B42DF7B79717537AA
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x66BA1D309D1131A45C3BCF74BBB20CB3
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0xFE5C41006876D79326B77D8D6453C65E
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xD461D6B620E98C3CAD47351F5BA40978
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x258C902C69D89B5D210B5292BE6FCAA9
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x9599E48F39B5A6BBEB6151097B5807CE
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x51B936D922E767A01BBB8BF4E303FD8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x30FD582412704BBC3621A629BB6B0E1A
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x1148232FFAEBD6443B6A749146EDEB24
entered.
0xED86983BE00408153B97E5F76C5BD058

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x51580C3CF25144014CE8BD1ECAD7060B
be ready: will you come down?"
0x895221E08F880554439A9195E7BCD53C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x17C5EF375C96EC38C859F2A6C98DF027
carry it upstairs."
0x68CD40706C732ED087E9F7691C5EF657

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You'll have some meat?"
0xD83C5D18ED8F42D9509D862E0B12FD8B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x60C059DC0CDE0EAE7934BD47567684E7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the sago?"
0xC111CB119E6C7970244D4F416A77E92D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0xCC303B28AD2C9E03FA26547EB0E55696
make it myself."
0xC27667F840505A21A51782033EB20BF8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x9FDA01E409BF1FFF851E843767C3427B
so I departed.
0x9B11F2F0FF05652778F3BC01F63D345E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x64062AB27172465FFBBD23A89D7D3C29
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0xD1D0F7AA55FC92C76B4391FB25B5B7D9
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0xD2E043AE82ECD853FC9EF71C096C3FB6
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x39603FFCDB9F454584E6836900E46F6D
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x77A45A1F6D23116CD941CFAABBC6A589
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0xD0786EC5CEDAE5EA9A81FBAB981DB26D
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x00B6703E8A7CA77EA724210EA282CC44
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x275413DBF5BBF9280DC2EA7214CB3CCB
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0x75E8EA757383746208DAD243F19262A3
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0x41E45C01C6D9C1F693BF9A2F22076BD0
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x3403B39AF330DBC70C66F96273A2C21C
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x18FEABA8E5B4B0C9D06FB157F43B2A2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x25E1784E23DC363AADA016BF58B91DBA
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x1B5F331A5543F56A77EE990DF990E8DF
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0x62BCA5AA19BBACC7AFC8481F2010749F
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x11D1A0F533F6F6B3EC57BF82EC624D09
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xFF5433BD57E05F0F54F36A93C1D9889F
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0xE7012719587134C5FDD0BAAE8328CC4C
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x26293206BA16C5C135280CA498918DA0
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xE9B13829E4B27BE3A3F2D63C9AEE3D4E
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0xE4307041BF7DA46AA00C0021B1ED2146
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0xB2A9905FA44B37655F83DB03E5D59150
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xDBC2BB9A5E2EE6D71141664D7922387B
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0x736FE148C74E196CBC067A6237C94718
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x0E6FE811FD4267F9B0DD48D19B80FF9C
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x6B2D580361BB9F4B09D354D83E51DEA2
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x8F63B4814EA661ED9C811514084D17AC
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0xDB17D521F88E55D486F19A39EF64E401
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0xA9CF7ACC98C4B9B053D2D428034378FC
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x1CD3E2E48320BAEA28DA5DA24E7A8444
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0xE3A131B393CE8A467FCC5F45BF1DE37C
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xCFB8FACF5DB2B073FD8A609F802A67F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0xC5838CB70B987CF975353F6F83C8D33A
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x9EF9DC8D8839A7E0AEC722701EA8872E
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x12CEEDDC543DB10E42893B9F066F2E88

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0xC7F1E4A607F2468898FC5EDCD363E8C6
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0x4215F446A9F2CDC092A03920DDE5D87D

"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0x5A739B76DD4C21FE66D1565E6EC9BC76
thinking.
0x9A02E589A0357F9C6504766AFD694082

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x96D336539F65DC35ACB1856A72083803
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xAA12F0421B2B04748DAC0FDD8497D511
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x00B093A05D6C5C35891C1CD4F4308E0B
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0x2E53A1B3A8993333D85F52C595E5CAD1
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0xF86DE0C8E1054B1A0112638AC51AC828
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xA37D10B02805AD9ABFF2255C58C936A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xE6FABE99730D53FDA98ABF322767A470
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x93C7CFF8D1DCE884A0BA499E52EF706B
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0xD22E2E6FC5508473228C01F45D7C5124
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x2FEAFE6C7B98510ABDD0F1DDC44744A0
impatient."
0x95B2AD8ED6A69A228ED0769A6624F24F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xC2BCFB53CB29C66DC56EF6FAF39D9C37
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x46FC8EA1C0DB6EE3B7D7F87E13AD57DD
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x67E010750144B304FDDB09B4F9EFDC71
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x1DE4AAAA06A523110DC610B9CEAF98B3
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x992C9CAA3E3A7C2F00E8EA7327BC2ECA
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0xDD0159CB393A33572C7B6D432775E35F
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x0C6F1BA6A36667604D3571D30D47F371
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x8F607D906A3BD29E8975844F5B27780B
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x20766B08B59232FBC7EC4F9C3826ADB5
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x96A4404E0B5D530DAF591AB898FC1B5C
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x0060D4C5FA3D01D66178A162BB283C30
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0xF52E4AAAFB7A5D397CC14FCEFDB50C6C
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0xDD218CF9D49889FBBAF602C005BA359B
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0xFAF362AB81263979DE12D04D87895E4A
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0x51EDFF2F7DF676E344DA411A011CAB68
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0x2AB61E39764A41FB2F1C49F7E87B699B
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x1479BBDE5FA6D178E529CCEC541A0E6F
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0xF5169703842E2EF1FEBDC7772AB8B467
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x0B0E61A7F06D7D4C97D52793218904D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x127F8DF70943092163A0A5C7760A2630
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x278E0E9AC6A20E05E499BD1EDEE6B55C
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x988B3181E7F1DBAAEA899DF955FEF7EC
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0x8E42B4C981D72C6934F4C90809C3D294

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0x28772EDC6955DDFB9988ADE0258218E6
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0x3119FE74649622E567EA2F33851E0ECC
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0xB0DBEE082F99966F606FE79B05F0C3CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0xBDE9E619EE0EDD8318B39F4E65F8E900

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x9FD3FC5354602E5C07D2C5D084B271A3
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x668D6422E8D1B5DC7EE2BD1B47584CE0
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x2D265C1CE74FD3774793CF1E4067B5E8
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x97EC36AF32CC8EB0F12BDD7C33FD2D20
deepening into total obscurity.
0xE16ECAD4DC7A440D7E5D381B031D2E9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0xC51A16C323655F8B7FC1F7FD90CC6CFC
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x7CAF34A6B85CFA7C43F50AA850AA6FBF
his journey."
0x5D24DCFD33A5BAEEC30D67902AC15C1F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0xE25807F738A4201FB3653E5AF2AA14CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0xF18F15A2BD23F1895E64DB606227D20E
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x3A6E30F686DF234767806117B5EC9999
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0xAADCC8C0458C811EB09439A0FCF428F5
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x68C44FFE99E1973BFC89A86B0BC8FC00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0xBFA4C13F5386E720DE07FB7AEA1F6D91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0x2F240802BA322DB5203DF3443925E476
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x87EE0C7C0334617609D75FF288FBE9E9
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0xB3656BAB3755A5BCC7C68922D722EA76
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x2D632E3F5B5AD459CDFAAE86588FE988
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xBFAD1A148D4DC9741CBB4D1DD1C1CB0C
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0x51732091269F6B2B98220ABA240D8A60
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x78C5DA56E1194348ABC7E7E07C74F013
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x401128603D0709DCDD964DBF310B9431
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0x29F32354F71BEF6E6DFD01D4000AD99D
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x1418B187EC2295B879C31856A970BBA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0x23DE7A948EE1C2FD7C40EA7D9747547B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0xD109731FA9EADB82C45BBC74D372A87E
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0xC6C86413223140FE8BD8E87B9A216EA9
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0xD18D36051433219A15031B414D78562D
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x7E0A414BAAA655BB066128DA8DF5C8AD
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0xA9D1ED5320A08BAD3A0E446BC0EC2E1D
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xCFE9CFFD30CAA01A9B65BFE62A188473
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x29001A448D5C3DC2E6EC6C0EC771D089
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xC3E0B7E00D09B4B1E683C5958C6309A3
the evening."
0xDA869BF0BD1261D6F4086D828274535C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0x777CD5BFA8A48ACD29153E2E8EC7A0ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0xCB86669106A9C94F2B2F65BE64B45A54
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0xFF7AAC53AD613DBAB13C4ECC02556D8C
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xD0954F391C0D26D1337DB9CC6EF2DFCE
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x44E53AA0AA355E4762FEBDA1CB9B187A
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0xCE44A8C3344A6C3402DE25AA58B52917
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x3250541EA77D582B1BBE8B1C6CD12617
was certainly the queen."
0x525E98BD554B0138017AF1EE9B1EA11F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what was she like?"
0x7670388DDB7C88C7616422ED4DAACA9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xD67BD9161EE1B3C4F8298AE2252F9C99
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0xE149B585312EFEE06413B161FF958A07
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xA1897A6CFEF1C739C38A317CFAD1ADB0
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x910238B1A90FE140FADF15F3C2E86099
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x307D7A37BF6E1A7905A54CCA90316F76
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xFB026EC39640D1E3ACAB45F73B84DB71
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x7CB2DA017E1CFAA03CEEF8C6D255E84E
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x43A92E96F1598A2A4BDBC9E7F28EA2FC
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x1F1C1FDA25989EFF7ED07BACC4EA5D4B
jetty mass of her curls."
0x06202ECE62FD58F49BC9A2C40A273A81

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She was greatly admired, of course?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x0845ED3C322C78BEEE536C74EC143C47
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x76779274C284871D88B1DAF57616E014
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
0xE9FE0F7B70770ED550E8EC92F124D1CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
0x039A6945F4B424A72CD0D54989062417

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
0x352EAB1C7361C7E410A74EF8B47EFA1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
0xD6B581A55269AA80D97DB80CE85C0713

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xFC819A864861D723BA267F8938C209EC
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x4041F9A3C9849BDE815A48A7912DDD82
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
0x952C5938E5F2EB18C184E1C31AE08F13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
0xDE5082164CFEB9CF7D710136FFC2E1FC
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
0x0108EE5348885982B90DAA66B651CE33
eldest son came in for everything almost."

"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:

Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
0x721E18108D6492E839E0C74E241E5A55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
0x78B97D5E61A6ABCB4BB2CA0705B959D7
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
0x3C00C72363A179651BD09B595776BCCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
0x51624F26F87F14B40BCF03D126D021BD
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
0x2B89742D33337D0E960DDCD25DD05DC8
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x7C1FCC66BB1AAFC4287B4FD95B5EC8E8
conversation was turned into another channel.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x004DE95D5BC0CE7E65E5EA57F48CD623
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0xAA5AF00FA65E0BC5AB7B4F6C1F57B877
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x6C1E6E121E3800A87F7A87C29343F0A7
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xEC78982818E207F8A3B15B2DB713E9D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0xB2725EF4DDECA10543DC3B567FF9DEA0
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0xC3B12D33E408C626D9264D5D73734CB5
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x7FE9560C6A627BCFA47BDB78164FA1EA
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x01662051E799FFB93C116377B91F0E72
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x206B641ED6D73997B41B514F9E3DDE4D
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x8D07DB771224D87FF2CBBDFE6EC25DEB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0xEF1486D96A26F168A43CDF1AA4580A32
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0xDF4B4680ECD515BEC264F720BF247567
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x58A1796C79C311FFAF1AA75BE0BE46C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xC38B866D30D6DAAF98757D57939569AE
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x5E28C8FA9C8927F25A446B368E27F406
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x7DB42F277A87EF608B9E82E88C1E4A8A
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0xA224002DFB99779468881D1E19B9AB85
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x14EA554B65BAFAE47E32080BBF2A87FE
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x57557E57755590088BAE84986550B673
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and

0x505EF47CC0FCEF5FC979F0BBAE03BC58
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x87BCAAC5B438B133DDE8B9E8150F88F4
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0x1A5C9D035B41ADDB2744E1CDB64CFF13
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x9FC6E85B16BA2BB41094368A1CAC42D8
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x73989FD093030653A1AF8B73E8A6A5C3
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0xA47C16B229B9DBDD5106117D85037CC0
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x5E46B978357FBCCC0B3885A4EE340F7A
is no extrication.

"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x184F6FD68CB1CFF112618F307D6937AE
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xFC28FAB6FB9395DC359CDC4A3CEC3F30
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0xE9EEF26884B302014FDA50379112B29F

drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0x2B77E597224C3C435E51E877537C2EF0
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0xE47A2EFA5867FCD4816D46B65B0E9E32
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xE3D842D58B8973D6B413F6A8BDD33C84
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0xA770BB0F4D26B88404BEE58E1395CE4B
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x88F30E1DFF09F465F0F1CF7D08537663
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0xF5B243119CB5D2E2CF7EE2C4128C614A
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x18D3B9AE7CDF60A711EB87C428E56594
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x4130AE90B92F6ADFE7B3EA2981503220
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0xA1906C58280A2C97167D227949712F69
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x427E2EA0AB29AB4E5F1509D215553084
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xB72BA181CBE3BB97681747BE6B675D27
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xEE9F1C652B12F004EABF093A53FE590A

"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks

well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x253C303CDD0B0EF3E8517DADB320EB5E
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0xDE4B25878793038CB93FA8AEC56483CE
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x59967014A7B04A14619D7A5ABCADB1EA
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x890E5B6634C1CB3CDC22AEFE1609E314

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0xD0EA47D570113FB8499984785ED5E873
calm, and fell asleep.
0x9A8C62574EE8C2CBD2E54A088FB46ACD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xC240FFC0241A3637F412814A0D9D7EEA
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0x8C5D6E33DF7925C03443B7A58CF8414A
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0xFEF47E0A3ACF6899FCB4FCBE4A60561C
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x2B0D487A14471FA72B5F7660D4FFB575
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0xCF35B3FBD27513178EB963593D694D04
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0xD0E4E134BC313286BCC2522E4597A116
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x712D60D410DB32F079AE1CD6285913C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0xE5A552F40F87A11B116EA50417A195AF
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0xE4E2D7CF98BF9BA56435C4416F5CFEB7
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0xA9B8D38D7FD30FEBD6D434EF116ADDD8
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0xA03E3906564FC5BB1276DBF2E6E9AE24
maintain, even externally.

0x7247916335707DF51ABA11743F4847AB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0x5574A7DD1A411F7BBA313993BBD16C95
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0xC3D62B134744034AC3E0EA89CF7E536B
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xD64C63B30ED84915EB27A149A6D52B94
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0x62F0F2118976C70E8458576B2CE2C2C5
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xF97D9F9A2DF73F9797382C7A9A0B2A5A
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0xDFD1E5449556BF75F153B2F362335741
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xF22E212903F2CF934C07BD5EE46C7855
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0xE366E5C4C40F20CEDDB77D7C991C3A71
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0x5FEF778710942ED6AD8F44998CD9B95E
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x18BE91E8B446325977A4C6B338BF8E03
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x6D2D03C2C418C4975A53F0E6BC9C7E3A
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0x9FCF3221D20AF8CC7F55E32F7D26EE60
on the contrary, I just said--
0xA14463AC50880E59F0BAF20AC388DC39

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x80FF3FB989A9D94C6AA8F82D6E1FA1E0
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0xBB2CBBF3288AA92E1C16C62C85406064
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0x1F82A2FEB79E93731844DBF171F96C03
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x05FA5E3BF0E3C16A1C0A491D789BDEDB
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x7174711D3F93D569971EAA8B5B9207C0
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0x191D5495ACA7ECB45DDDE0E3711E2081
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x916321248D06E6C89FA5F67711CBC325
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x43FD5B500942AF58AC38521A11CE7D75
wanted and would be despised."
0x6E14678B220E393672BC94E281CA5E8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x4CCB2668E01FB95CC4E9B05DA62F5F86
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0xC6D84A8936AA4AB092555F539C3EB3B0
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x25C07A1687B438649293FB57043DC8F5
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x2F9698913135D345F19A6E411BB63092
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x64605272F5B999DB13C55C4D801863AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x787EEB625EEA1C04702D1A19062CD1FC
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0xEED9C07E9EDEC5E79BBF7A08EE7FC5D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x26B7187E936620875EA5658EF32EFED8
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x0443D95FCFFD1A23CED47732A262A975

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x45FBC492C363EC0294B5DB00CA490120
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0x661E42E8716B838AF02012ED3C22FFE2
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0xC9E18E32C0C2D73FDE1ED75F56386015
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x30B77715A0743425FCB142E9995FC337
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0xCD89B9AB16C9796035AAD8D3FFBC30BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0xEF86B7D3D3927BAD29FB4DDC79FE10BD
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0xC70511ED9C1BE0520B8F4BA0A061D2FD
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x1F2D7B4D12CB92AC2E7C8AFFB444B38C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0xC8825420391D2BF5C2F95D83C1199314
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x85CB5079565D87896C7F613342E386FA
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0xBFD8D96E05D0E48A57A5D272F95F4645

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x7A03BF853CA5400E3D48CDF14116154E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x9CECB550976491E14A67BFCAF6E3C45B
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x98ADB8D8A7A16471F638717A91571B7D
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x41BA3908E1903CF1214D7446742424C5
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x69E30E913968E0344FD8F871690FC789
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x64851A60056965F86283A9F5ECA80377
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0xADD25FDF84EEA43B469124B765D18986
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0xD0AF245EB8C3B858B0EAE83FDAE26B84
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x0765394B36A2F66322625929584C9BE5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0xA57784358E9ED66BE06386764EFD2AD0
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x12A5C9AF2E49CEC0367278016569A1F0
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x9CE4778F999C7A0A57EFAC9A7C389EEC
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x63241BB14D14EB9551A67E9A4E0AE0A0
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x148D590E5460F7391AAF225599FFAC13
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xAAE323D54B1D2B75478EBF983EA5B6DA
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x87A7E5A39EBEAFD1171B91388AF5ACC6
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xB67E3E06DC6EF9C7D85E7A01B0E6D39E
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0xD458E5419BCBB143CF623EB2AB9AA4EA
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0xD41FF7E6EB182B505FF4B960A198B6E4
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0xBF2C2A2270A76A149473386C9505E3FA
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0xBAD7D459F5159C9DE47E87F31DF8D8A0
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x0F1D1D95B64F63D919B2131228E04AFE
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0xBBC046BF95926133B8BCC528579490E5
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0xFB9701BA1C1F377ECB19B0391908879E
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xCE588DAD55376C0A3E51CE63A6DB9C99
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x4E53AD91703E388084EEF6C09832D1C8
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x9E954F124E312D97DF6CA35C952E4D01

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x9A953FAF11B4C91556D6A37C79758B3C
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x36E7F9A53C48A0514CFC135721804112
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0xAFB2A66990752C507214D3B5C3F6E4D4
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0x8112D6D811856E191329BF612C9A767B
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0xB90F76D9F724B70FF18EFA96A7278B7C
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x86E520CF31C7BB8829017411301E6803
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x72651C302930046C462472743BB4BB59
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x0CC9654EA243E95CB39FFDAC4891BDF9
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xE302564A7DB7CBC1518ABC3CE2699BE4
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x7F5C21D23646E349BCE3EB64087BD7D9
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x382DB251E30CE4A5533A18C5F742270D
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x21FC5A582CACC8B83BAB133033D5450F
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x115E4E792DDEB3FAAE1CC6C7D92A3F59
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0xD7094E45F5321E7E37D05D33AA97A26A
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0xF8FD60DED37DB57F48BF0566C2D8BFD7
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x9703358DF2168F4E99C16688A2569F96
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x40A3110718B41E158C38D17299BF223D
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x80088CD891E3A317E245466F040ED630
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0xCB12A146E6C227D8BA14D05E2EE9604C
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0x6CF3543C35BFCAA746860CE0D6DA2C42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0xF7AD80B26E37E98EA1C60D509C7AB4D6
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x317B66750F303D61FFDE22C881AC0457
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0xB9320B91612EE72E1633D8BD68359EC7
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x003E29648F87AF7CE72751032BD8FF79
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x45188E87D8C446281F930D6FB0B97F72
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0x4DFC74E4E511E9B670B7E1883E401E5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0xC68CA8FE26893EE0B87483C2D2F4F3E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x0CAB0FE3178306FFF6DAC387C77313CB
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x63D3CF41C0E9EBDF701EE8C790936BFE
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xBC345E6937F7C3CA5B9436DF99105D80
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x9112D3A027FC92D0E4AB09548CF48D6E
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x073C24C3463B98151F0F2344A66E5840
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0xB2CF3770F569ED3DEB4D693A94A0016F
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0xCB3B27F02B788D90726099B4A81A1A4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x42B93591A6EF50786FEA83003962CEF8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x5C34648180D9CF2E5F0B327820ED7ED2
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xA5AE7969F3EA7090F71B327F70F68D67
the money she gets."
0x57F60201DF66D13A63DCF0C3D2736F49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x0D926EC6BD8A1BD4C35C9EAC9060CA2E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x81F40C8A6636D2B62820DD1FCA0DCBB4
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xA31F6E591B28B3BA243DCC2D34ADAC26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x4EBDD92DAEF7C259269ADAD035847E7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0xCB626555E09B305354DB02F55DEE084A
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0xA7CA490AD3EB65FA82A37BF018B596FD
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x50FD148B3CA7DD1800F77007C9CA8F81
excluded.
0xFB7731A5C5701CCEA56B6A476057E29F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xD8E5AD94FE1CA90EE114026282325898
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0xCD313AE99595BE4AEB9161A3FD65399D
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0x98B8AB69667F1A11420F87B5EBC6223A
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x4778AE24CBE0268F53CF6536EE93C0BF
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x1E3F5D12212F2807BF0A9A07E6434ECC
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x135440F88DCCE1FA25513D548309C879
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x5A65DA57EF69E013C349610BED752B0C
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xF8C2D8FF3A707BD5281E53B222D50948
sides.
0x5B6FAF37387E7885A2107328A5894BCB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x3D46C9AD750472411CA8C61FA77A5308
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0x22787ED3068F1CEBE0E385140D705EDA
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x3D4885DA74917B58A3E002E8AC91239C
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x502FC99D383CA87EA7FFAF54E4C14886
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x7BA9246AB89D83DD8A20165186234334
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x5D4130E0D0FE4F4C17802629A3303D16
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x1448B75002C2B0A9016B806787E3B11D
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x5007C5E6A92CAF24B12A85B5A7711128
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x420EE3AFA287386A2711DED48FED8BA1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0xA31C2ACD72E6A8777E543C57EDECAB1E
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0xBC037CBC2780670CBADFEC5A8AF1CFC6
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0xD2510FC48B0136353FC6B177FFED8E12
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xA8EFA09AE30ADAD00FD1484FD7A4F5B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xF6A82D324D9122EA8F6B0587A75ADA9A
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x1F426893BB4709E23F10EEDD3BC22BD2
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0x0744636968E859DF096E48685E7D9746
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x0B20E03D715771A2DAA3485FC49A0043
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x8F8BE95DF4D0626ED4BC37B0CE19F389
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x87237788418CDBC3E890645F7B16099B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0xD0BDF4878EC30EF0A187B3BD7C310EE3
minutes."
0xC6E2164D661E175A056AAF431AEC8CED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0xCCB4C448DE3A24D902BE157F437875B1
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x4BAD2918D64DC90A05C6960744FE33F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x97550921797C3C5F962FE4B59A4C3660
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0xBB32E4FB6D408B2F3C23F88A54ACCE88
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x8CC2F5A2397577533A2FC86DAE36F10D
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0x86E559F3DA0071679A240ABCD55328E0
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x1CA5463EB6ACCD5F471A7D1B1BDB4A0E
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xF18F5D1058E1278F2CC12B228FA5D6F8
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x3C40954DB5E8E5CFE2D53012F77C012C
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x4205F922E08F11B363C4CE406DAB2B7D
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x66401C445DB79BF8C29C1687A0F586EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xB74604B25DC8C9410E9A749473766A98
below.
0x2CC4F0E4725A7F751B04F77B115BA9CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xFA95BBB7589D5704719E8F1CC7664E86
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0xBD759EE64FBCD2FBF070C285481C3C54
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x43C9C563231A7D696F91B9AC0B839383
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0xF2ED406F847CD712CFFDFD6B2869B232
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x817852F38E438968CAC5AF08A9C14F3F
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0xD8BAD4DC87A7AD4B9D709EA170C5E43B
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x9B84EAC59A5E5B054222ABDABC344C69

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0xE49C9ADF68167D05619D879B0F2CBD39
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0xB1B064F75C41A479FE44694E88E5EB8A
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xF506CB18CDE8C1EE2B48869D7179A468
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x595D95FAB54EA20853B5507E28C6A49A
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0xFEAD1A3ED846AE62B7F0F123DBE1B4D9
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0xF7ADDFE9F23F20D6757F304D8D31BB7B
and, for a time, a hush.
0x8490C378F585EE12A54054A5CAE4BA76

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0xFBA812F5791146B1B0B71D35B852F2DD
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x934F1BD3C1FA3570766EB8661F12DD50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xDE15C3485AF9E97C70FE996F86B57E48
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x159B98C3D9A776195B4D628FAE38402D
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0x9B92BF8CCAE1EB65A62242A5B3BFC6EC
on apprend."
0x155EE3179504D17EBCB9DB217D1CB893

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0x346965AC59E0F7824197D5216BA1FF3A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0x7FF16A3CAE52EEE080FFFD6A8E90376A
mange."
0xC655F5B3288FB42BB65B2AB7A2AD208B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0x8A95065687E5C16975312663BC3A0F2F
get you something to eat."
0xE154B7D0663265D05F56B5FC8B107760

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x4C2B3F8C57DF51658A26C20BFADA4044
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xE417F856B9C7DB9B11F15F00478F8ED6
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x90DA92DA333EFE3177BBFEB06FD96CEE
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xE3826B127979F5363EAF1677FDFBA1EE
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x698FFC05508406CF056A6D57B9FCC05E
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x184D926BB101F76380EA2F73F91D7E6B
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x1597978EF9D7F1D100C1629812A2A940
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x85013F18FF0EDA45DFF329B292B754B7
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x63C08C31122071130F3F8F46F4BFB355
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xBE53E8125F4EF899930C3C591500450A
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0xA8BCBD634578FD8FD1CCEED2ABDD8A13
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x486E3B7FE1BE9D85B82B36401B2520D4
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0x0D548A38F8DEA27AFE0EF977A6D4666C
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x2ECF7DAFC0F0ADEE254E39002549E5B9
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x351758C9CEF9D07D5F8D97C62DEE8C33
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0xA59CD0EB0670E2B0E8828D6C4F52B227
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x572895399E71EB2674A361E3741DF8CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x9766B0FC20740AAD60FCA8A4D4EF2445
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x4370A7598F3A1F9266C0C69C9FEA47D9
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x4E1D3267C6F1F598BD8F10F60C70396E
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0xB7C1597B8C955435DB227D3AE7E02981
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x0115E20E070D09EF135375C91DC1B41C
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0xD35555C781A225B861AA5F7EBBC1F89C
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x665A34900AF5890AF25FCB46B24811D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x1CECF4F3A9622473BE6FBDF7B70584CB
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0xBC62E0AD1633E786A77282A34CC7CD3F
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x07DA57E0AA397FDD8D1F8F28FD0B7202
dinner?"
0x2C77F0F1A6D5D48E67661E44ABD8DABD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xAA397F4B4C2C549129089DC099E02B0D
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x3C95C0921309FC034054CCADE0A8C097
is your dinner."
0xA5D9E64A93F7D260F88DD50FD1B808F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0xBF74CDA0FF4111621F483B3B66268B6A
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x3AF6141AF1FF361FE1247E0B7AADDAC1
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0xAEF20DE35423C4B335C8422B4205059B
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x27CD0DE5D76A4912D8A7241293C96E75
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0xF4EE48C29F8076A4AE2F1C32C0360819
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x06B5DC39B971119DEE279BA128184115
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x0AED14DFC03D198650C29B60767CB834
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x5337DB30BE7CAB14B7F0ECE524A46DCB
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0x86ABB7FBB44019E7498BADFBECFE5C12
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xE1C5C359E4C11621B52D3BD345CE1E95
quel dommage!"
0xEBBF0DC8AD599A4466BE1F1E802F2AC6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x9C04246A5FF4B7ECCF10DF327C53F851
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0xEF534BDCECF1ED6DEEE4989A4C3BC7BF
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0xC9220A6A06CE0D6B28AE2EA476AB8F87
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xCFEA320527A43EDA9A5FF1B241179CD0
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0x24A389BB78A53F6C7CBA6459D839848E
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x639C17604D81700CCA3DFE53D94B5F68
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x283B36623E57FD9364B107BC0025B172
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0x46C63B7096F2D5FA09EA4060AB4F5AAA
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x92AF070F0F623B19CB64C996F4A40D75
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0xE9A6FA022C35968CF8EA3D0FEB9D9BA6
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0xCF904BF8333AABC5BAEECCBA5CB04B0C
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0xD4ACFDFEF9A0F979166C948D6D867B02
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x4FB6F477C9BF50C25FA960FC2824765B
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xC278D8301157E04BC5FE8217B183D408

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0xCB3577618B6F9C769156D7B649DE551A
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x87485AF5B8C85BF20161C3A4BFD19792
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0xE28C0E9DF79D38A12F57828B93E30815
sought their chambers.
0x7EAEDC4FE20709ADB89431AED6BBDD09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x3816B6D1757D5974DFC8CE27048543F8
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xEBA15817C69461EC278C70B2D1F95905
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0xB8FD8C6B8938EE1942BE08B4952FCC2A
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x205AAC2623FA02A7D23A8A601CF839EC
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x8EC648FE3469802F13A8E89BD67F797A
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x9D3F23581CB9D434B7C48031CF9943C8
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x448FFD6BB08D3A2BC0928E0588162BD1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x1402980D59AECB44A50D768E1D21B4F1
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0xF9183708CCB1F62BA981051BEE7EDE70
ladies."
0x0267ECAB1571465C40A18F6951DA51B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0xC0BA4AC78F2A712CA6181C7A55E5D990

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x26619AB1A4FCA09478787434699F8E47
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xF981987269155863A0E70F796B97D659
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x6034FCEB586E70844FC68981BBF35D18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x5787B6BA015B58C9D7C290BE1BF63388
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xB35F24E82162A7C2BEC9ECD76ECA339B
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0x6F9BF4A93613B6495678DFF5A506B859
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0x11C52903AD7C457F8E340562FCBEC5D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xE120AE5CB944CD177857D88DCB29C833
answered.
0xFD5E433077B0034E48696F62E76012B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x90B334DF580AAAF28E9A1B07232C53F8
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x1F698B09DE30D95E8F804A7CF734AE91
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x6C186D7E9A1745E54A8D812F25C5E87B
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0x50EB44AF2BE9CACF9EC4F7DC6FC11F18
case of contumacy.'"
0x5EE6609CC1FB529626862B1B0D50CB4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x80D2F8C9E2CB706CF767B9F8F8187C36
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x2FC3F2F8CF9F381D66B7E9AF4FC02CC8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x86BE0B823F43641AC60404A7BE85069E
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0x496DEB812A15CD0F942B498AE7CCA4FE
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0x3634A3A0EA335685F42ED1C186AF519A
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x1EC21D5AB0955B44B2E53D174FF44378
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xC5AB4086037B83A6ABAFA35C7B026CD3
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x0F2DA1E460E0495893AEC3F829380EDF
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x46A4DF069F87AE560DDA24675C733351

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x9F7E1AD2BA45092C3ED67152B34B26D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0x86FD6539B2637010258FC49BA711404C
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x1DA83CA71C250828EA9665D9CD71ECCF
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x3B87CFE74F7487724B142009BB3DC599
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x6A45D657F0B83170300AE488A29FCBE8
stay at Thornfield."
0x04E21018811FD1BD8E03AE135AA4D033

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x744C44AC0234FEF1A8A2034D878A6CC8
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x90F8FBB987BB64E665854075C1610181
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xB8EFF68569E98A35358ADC88E3A8B969
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x703E20DF875B867485754DAB08440028
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0xACAC1A57F2272C19E646EF13D950F670
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0xEEC257E8AEEF118D1953A554582F2197
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xFDB1D1B4F29C7418440720BBDE9B89C6
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x5EE2603982AEF0589D19F44C12E4B4F6
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0x484757636E8CC0DD3C774861AC857E95
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0x424BF02DAE4B11E4F8EACF0788D52A62
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0xFB91E1626B77A84030552CB88AD62110
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xEB44A8B651A06CC420B0165D41F3A034
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0xB8C3AAF13B4B224CC90CF219F34CCCDF
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0xAFB81124A7F665A1A2C8AA6CEA47F1EF
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x2370F4675BD89FFE0E11C40B237524B1
descended.
0x05BC90BECF16E5D9324C42CE7AF05AED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0xAB5BF33DAFB21D5256B010535F91C87B
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x8C7ED581B6523552054CE215D1D865E8
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0xFEBA38379DC211C6CBD696F72D104154
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x730D07D2F7BF18B17F4C60ECF2905089
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0x2F22CDA9CF34DEC86D20416AA1C70FF2
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x041C5C7F27447DFC863EA3C4A9DCA0BD
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0xD7132D6E4E645008434410428B9C3978
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x97C122D1E8675C269944E3880558D817

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x088C2CE9F5BCB80AF680E6C3C4B5C832
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0x42F0600A6E0078A8D68148B214B18358
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0xB70E20C21453D6313770A55E9036CDC3
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0x2B1C5F6EF59C98F7F853498EBDA944F8
touched my knee.
0xD854F95452ED7D5A1C98D98B179B381E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is it, Adele?"
0xBF94BD247366E682235F1164149CBFAC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x877976815C9A1EB4BC57D8C33EF50230
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x0750BA9DFEB0698CCE338F45559E1FB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x53AFF095564E5267D146B5C6E1A8FB3E
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x4FD552AF165B1F268E84990702F2B890
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x85A49DDFC181C18A7F13800F3E9C2414
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x8057B621A39F5FAE72080ABB86F91E2D
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x583DB5C4937FA86090806BE54F0B9BAB
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0xEE0825E89392C43A244F11397FFB296F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xCC3B6F5BAAB156F9DB9EA881242EAE72
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x8F9C48871EF91A69F1EB4FA5A36C6BD7
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x4F8A65BCB6A4110B240CAF323B5965BD
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0xF8787C2F153FB82F98A51E833B67063F
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x51D92271DEBD76089125E16F8DE59B3E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x1586450D26D5B5283BDE7735BD465FB0
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xF835D928AD0EF2FA5D68E91081F4321E
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x7B9EAF888E432957A9EC2CCD8664BF6C
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xF306B6395105A272E5592934AA9E8A23
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x527737EAA59C87A89735B3C1FC34F959
stared at me.
0x7940D15DB069493705990C3676E178B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x4EAAC514676B50F0AC4E5D21BA5E526F
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xED1EC84F59AC22ACFEA4B88127FB1AB1
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0xD4AB192B7609C939114A235B76FFD21D
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x812C7FDA69091DCB805F47C717929D31
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x7B86911E0C0D998BBE38CC44587B22DF
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0xE43656798E3C3E0A351922FC5341E58B
and may as well mention them now.
0xA6F6F0171879AC0C366F304ADFF4CF0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xE53FE0C414D70BFAE5EEF715C2DE18E6
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x21A6C3D2A434820BE8CB6FC09A4D451F
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0xA9B9C04584601E5652463B7235584A29
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x8AF2C8D0700C695B817DFF32E05A5E14
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0x3596E3333301CFE93A7B129FD5F0BBCF
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0xC581D2291FEA5D8B2B8BF3575ED049F3
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0xA4E0A75806DB00486FD6FB2D8BB30210

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0xDD70D4F6D6A3C3A76A6F10C4A826D5B7
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x99352F54D4A1529FBE29DCF4D62FF54D
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0xD3A4C5CFB2369304F2397B1B6C342715
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0x67208873234FAD7259613A5BD42A0E68

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xA9F17FAF0B5563D8E8E71A4155BE1A0C
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0xD642101CF164348655DC72B6212C8149
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0xFB0E211DE867BD22C62E4777E822E198
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xAAD93C848237C4FFF3DAA7AFC049FBDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x164D7FB1B217B989243A533FE8263721
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0x373761E5858999BA5DE36FE25D5EF0A1
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x07FF32F722BD6F0C64B5ECF1F821DFD2
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x5B4FAA3EEA1BFD050B2A1F6F04EE7B8B
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x51D7E1BDC8175057D92AC16C0BB51E46
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0xD83DC4567CF458FC356C30AB328C1CDD
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xE818E4E1AD65BA42AE7269DC62B74575
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x8117BD0C53730FD37C9BDAA8BB6A018D
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x3ADD3C51071D26F748A85A986AB11B8E
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x450D7563125AB2F19541A904DB9E2293
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x741A3ED949D9E393C356A802162ED558
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xB1654D19BDE7D7599CC2D09435F19236
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0xD43562B0BD1F8C7B5285A57270B6CA5F
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x6758BF5A8C34EC39D20157D19624B488
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0x643006609DC5688210DD9E6DF7CC8DAF
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0xF250A36F646E29F578C4E0EB0C7A6EAA
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xFB853EB646946D82079D9BDCBCBE26D8
truly imperial dignity.
0xBEF9B47BCC9F5F7F43CECFA702CF2B18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x38494CD589E706AB37BD3A876CC80D15
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x2C0A559F57973181483CCA6B5E8632F5
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x80FE672574F60DF5294348DD6CEBE4ED
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x9F239D02D412133FA766305B452BEA52
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xC538E104B4832B7146F0DFADD7955F0D
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0xADFBBCBAECEA87E4D6CAF05E9983E665
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0xA86214FB883379F52DE30D38784E4FF8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0xF3640B66F5C34059CBE9B5B5427F5772
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0xA439EC51D1D9DE8A7DCDC40EDAC6151C
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x8B8189C5A3CF0EAEFF5DD792E9DA1754
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0xFF9AF0EE6BEE98200C0D0AC3CD626153
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x71CEF8E97E81327EDF47C5896DF8CEB8
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x36CF22055B2BE54709D70B451ECE33D0
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x1ED51CCD50C627FF5D80DA18F09176BC
haughty lip.

Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0xD80020CBCE90701D052C42B3A05DE598
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x3B3F600A90130C3C4DD830792351CB03
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x4BAEF6F7857973BC25AF04F4617DFB73
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0xE1B382E8FA941FC20FF5AA67A7530901
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x993EC15D70E2FE691FE7C988C0F47E64
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0x6BAC32231594C5FA9533A3B4124FD167
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0xD3D41E0C3654924ACDDF864FE409F903
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x6413AFA233DDC9B7237E4DA7EC846421
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x6EFCA801011732BFE2B30594CD113B8E
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xACFE85A2D7E00F44B70B4DCA44962589
with fluency and with a good accent.
0xA01E50A98F27885BEA8F52785B7F7BEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0xB0823DC47B468FAF5FF62DDA234F2213
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x334654506A5346BC3603578FD0CDA229
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0xF892567230CB0405377C412F136E2811
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x8D3536F8E08F2C431D93E7CB67725E46
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x389F6D52EAEB12C72E3BA3072C2C9BEC
in spotless white.
0x7CEAC9529F91DB2B39822D24550E00E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0x2C27748E373629D72EA84345D454854B
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x49B6ADE2BC098054409EB9D37DFE668E
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0x2E530D6E6C04A1BEC0F2135F4FB488E9
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x6DEA246D45337E9B8D0C16ED9AE93DE5
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x0216EC07518DA6F205E35A8F450FC87C
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x6F0FD958AA0B96A05AC19EA925C3B420
together.
0x209C0C86BCBED7619B8D8C9E7D3DCD6A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x828A1A5280F2B76CF951036E9868C3E4
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0xD868F29BC8BF0DDBA2019C0635CC42D1
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0xE9583479646E0ECFD6154639FC2821F5
gravity--
0x81E4137AE410C393339D9AD10631842D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0x07E33A5E8F73435D0B6E1414B56971D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0x9C465D13EA6A69B75E9C3887F49E42C9
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x74C0FD27D2467B0952693D3E11E2924C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x63A0A73B1E40E4A9371A2C6457EA3D14
little French girl he was speaking of."
0xBAD0AAC2EABFE0289EB31C5C5B8BB69E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0xC5B4DACE2AE7E96DD5BAD035F6480FE6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x7048038C355C934871D697BEAE23CEFA
child!"
0x732608232A7F11B915BA1C741A2D459B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0x7AC6F4C63A99915B43EC8870998E905D
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0xAB9EA22BF2507E060D5D2A23FF4503DE
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0xF42A0CFA23637995DDF42CDBBE6B8F6D
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0xDED05ECD4D4E9741A4CA220811653B9E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0x93BB914456208D2B91D6EC1108BD333F
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0xF6463542532B02209E8CBBA023229CAF
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x25DD6B78479F726E2E9A264B71FA0D57
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xC1B5682521B3B5324A5D68739E045BB2
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x3827699B1998869DF777CDA84C187E09
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x70219FB0324D4C65DDAB938F2AB04FDD
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x29DBA17732F33975120FBC684F0BEA20
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x2885A81FBA9183D4B5B410CA31B6795A
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x3077B6FD4511BF0A2B7DC75A9E675EBB
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x402FC937A5FF06B04A5B178EAF10EE2F
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x8F2C19A12374043B77D59CD144FC9DEE
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x782037D513CCA4D1CBC4BC148A1D2330
blood or vigour of brain.
0xBB43A625706469E8E0D80287A60BDA1E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0xE6422489C18738528E08B65176B4AF30

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0x82B0264EB940534C7E5D8E3619D13A69
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x3047E89B40FF62C06C307666500ABAF0
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x8529B4544C3D0FE4C27418B9AE413071
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x0871AC4F2CBFFFD640D5A5173BCB7E04
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x6DD9A468412E5738D8C5FA565FA0082A
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x79A6841579E30FA3AAF7C7D5098E7212
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x21FF655AB76947CADE5082D6929078DE
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0xE9AF99E0079BA930A086749ABF9A7A7F
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x703BE76CDFF1DB7BC655D0F09ECDF1B9
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0x6F56048581BE5C4338A33C46DA31A7D4
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0x9B38DCFB2A92773F3199395B6FBC7DB3
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xCBC604F361A3E7AF764F5D145AFC798C
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0x57C718C100532E90E74C6918F024EDD2
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0xBA91C15F917452EA1AD02417B3A8B7FD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x99F97C834D2CF91D7A9917161BA11431
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x1BFDC27D2C32698A7FBFF2DF045C3177
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x33C87E14982BBB0F379044C5F062A573
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x8D13045D549C00C208E6C0B07C02FA29
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xEB04017AF894C17883F708EEE4DA0124
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x3B5DC8867C023FCBA31F0D03F3393C4B
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0xF9FAAC5C6D706054B19D83DAFE87884E
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0x9803B3038B07379426DDD3F72A30F565

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0x76E6C0EFA39CC4768DED4936DA716C58
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x84A4763684FDDB409CC262F4235B68DF
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0xBF09D61DC01B7A1EC91CBAA0A01DA97C
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x9C0B52CDD0FC63C0446419A135B164DA
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x62CA6C3743426E512C9BF74F43CD7264
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0xC1D9DE28FABB0A284B61F898AE6B62C4
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0xD2A1D45C59B50B6EF4ABDF6E4DE2D838
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x8B0AB3DAF0CF7A94D85115F94664BD11
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0xFD44BE3FABA2AC2F0D7672590ED5000B
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0xA66C859A4379FC0AD4A09AB12C4D83D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x631B36AC0DE58ED3ADED27E0F5C52AFC
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xA89D463BFDB8E4414A3271AEE06B43DC
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x2DB4027101AA329CAAF3E8A43BB8F5D5
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0xCA77D9960B325CD506F2AE6DA78D7992
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xDAB0FA1D339A65177A68C5A9E08D4FBF
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xA1997B5F5E7CD32A22911850B4FEE845
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0xF550CA2A275F722DEB3B80E899F5117E
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0x4B5F22C1AA18DC61B37553B8BB1CCA93
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x6151A5680E69122FDCBF2B4B0696EFBF
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x2DE8F68B73D4695438475491254351F6
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0xB3CCB1864E54BB821D8E09E35BEB13F4
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0x9A70611722A73F65A5AA479355024634
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0x6FCEB90A4A935942EF9F04AD2868B1B1
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x009BE6A0E4212EDD46B9721E2DFB6404
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x461FD8C73E65A00572FFDCA8E52BE901
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x6A5A624F69CF83B5C400BD8077B32787
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0x43FD8602BEEA7A574C66F3BDC5632080
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0x9D57812B156CF2F9EB72E5D638A5E4C8
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x4DCD25545FAF06D7F96DDDF97C71184F
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0xA9901E2482DA938EBDA112167D14D0B3
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0x9E77825E9911C3B92C5D6A3D143D0859
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x38F051808EF70D0CF0541954C34ADB19
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x6E182E027E34F2FC86F937A649271073
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xAF97621A0C0FD344FE5380E884C5A1E3
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0xDDF54AB0C308C15E0B30B5F8BC12DA9D
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x9949E48EDE55AA2D0F3ED018002D4683
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0xB090650D913DBBBAF3E3A8B426908666
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0xFE409BC08ADC73CFF1B24C569CD5765D
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xF742E9CD9AA107C255C15424447910B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x7A91B31DE44C3AE9C52CB790C971A3D5
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0x0CEE6873537AEA7FBB14B813E6373B4C
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0xDE3EF95D27E1E8E93D07E758F5920767
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x9CE35C84C226D0EB8A5FBB22F0295A01
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0xA36329ECA6BE4F01FD4155850C205AD1
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x2A2FFA5D23025F4724331F62A6F6F8CC
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xA6FDA63F488E662BD18E214B7C449B4F
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x33CE163DB8803D964D2FB95721873B26
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x8EEF676AC27C8FB95A74114C1393C9C1
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0xB773A30FA114525649EDC642B43A8945
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0xFE7A891D561915DD3416B60B1DCF12A1
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0x9353DF3CCC8FCCAC4FF9F744B4CADE75
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xE269F90DCDAD2A55E652689D26B258E0
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x7F03788795F6B731B39A16847962B033
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x0991A38CBB0B7529440DA93AF58CAEE0
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xAB35BC3A62B5A84EB29B29DA55F5C119
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0xD55F0219F2E123F8F01EEC8F0812684D
selects a mate.
0xB154A879CB56DCEF752A77F1601D0E01

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x0453091C7CBF86B694521401DEA8E024
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x91655A980D00D724FEC1203919C367A2
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0x21E24904E1FB9FD8E3ED7D07D51727E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0xF8A922EAB2B2650CEDF1298A72886C93

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nor am I."
0x0AF6A6269BB589C863ED685527FBA8E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x538054E648F2E11310C05790C5A49D4E
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0xE5794326F4338910EDD005C4807B72EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x56649398B36C8408802B26ED26C94ADA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You should have sent her to school."
0x47D15DE45F0820B64B9E64305F50A5F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
0x51AC929046CCAEB6002CD6DB59F1FEC7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x8BB22C1A54F619D0F82F3699533CC429
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0xFD543FA3C05847C8B2E9145B87ED5C71
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x4FD21EC37AACA26056A57B1B955E666A
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
0x38F565A8D4D5AB92EE6577C2F86B358F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0x8514DAF8A9072B79EA552EE5832906AF
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
0x3C1E9F8E653022F7B79F74C2E814C011
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
0xA94B2D2D3F973F34FAAE7EFD36430D21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0x878A072C4F7577ACBD228833314640F9
straight before him.
0x8E9704F6142C47DA9FEF423CD2081095

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0x473AAAE3F3C7A1A13CE1C416604666A1
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0x86541A9D72C1AC4E9C29F5EB8E46933D
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x6DE5F201197DD84DD1B92377894FDCCE
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
0x997DCDDA1B71B3A1494758DD96A49760

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you speak, my own?"
0x0EA036AD40766B1970AEBB86F1BEA088

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
0xEB2EB0C942A07BA5BE70E3155854E318
her question with an explanation.
0x6AAC6AD30B169EC71A9197BC19D4D6AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0xA7714558F061D174F7A451EEEA1CD233
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0x70C6D4234CF972DF4A4866DA3232ABBF
Heaven I have now done with them!"
0x3AA909F25FE3D12474A7EC5366AEAE3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0x8FA7533B13F00786EA8465F43C2A5FEE
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0xCE339938503FCE15923B9D9896B7E0E3
the anathematised race was present.
0xABF9033BABAE8FBF194A390F1823A7C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
0x3A1B9FA886725024578DA8C120E75819
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
0xC2AA5A452AC1C8DF492B99EFA0A79490
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
0xA8B6EF8FC41232454CAD1563ED45650D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
0xF5707B1C2D66499BD609B12E48ECD4F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0x3F0AAC997852CC199E522FC5D5405B73
three times with portentous significancy.
0x8ECE62FC8C50A3B9BFBB13941554D806

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
0x20DDA90DF10C5D1DFAF54AD2202A785B
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x56661CC8781311F8C57B4EA52AFBF64E
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0xFEDC71FFA339D945A9BF4A6E3339AD24
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0xF4E1271A1462787B056506A020215672
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0xB8C6B43BB1A4982F0270FC231EED85BC
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x455ABB099CCAC10C93CF73A2E2E1727D
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x5BBAE11624873DD850935B0338EEB906
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x7F4CAFA1078DFB492B6AC65416ED4605
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x1B24A0BE71242B5A576E7FA86C69833E
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x23A4D8ACE7992BEED2E24E47A5875709
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x26DACF8545279BF812EC15552FF95365
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
0xF964DDD24F2C548C22469F2152C865D6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0x4884B58F52B046DFB357B7DABF3C7EC7
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x7E53141709C9ADEE3010943A78728F1B
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x9183C052BDC6F4BCD750B0CBBEE19CBD
when she was herself so ignorant."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
0xDE11CE7F99165536B4530DDACAF6E788
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0xAF60A1DA25973F12551153A7F0B8308D
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x502932D1E6F9E443FBCAC8E59C461BC8
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0xA0B88A0A4DA5710F0139CC63E5511A86
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0x54F3DDDD52B8F53ADA2C4F66AF9692E1
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0xD0B13C849AFB0B2605CBFC2606CCE907
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xC77E1A56368C62EC8D51B61B77638B26
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x320A0F6C740F2D283BA202857E8E11AC
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
0xF167477B151356289FC04E202B532627
lady-mother?"
0xB8AD9213D43D1BC0A3D30EB7A1C1FB39

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
0xFE815ECB1CA6569A25D6429D67C15A86
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
0x457D5D8A389C37953A4CC92179C36244
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
0xDC76731CC1A525F16440CDEBCF6D6480
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
0x72886CBE4C90D29178614DAF41776C06
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
0xAF87EBC5F4D85ECCBBBE2DCF347FF667
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
0x2312B34039225571DD496673BBD01EE7
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
0x15F4C57B28E8DBA0D3A7403AF5476B41

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."

"Then no more need be said: change the subject."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0x4126B2E79D67FDEB881221756CC1476C
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0xA78887F5EF6895D972153A84A9CE98CB
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
0x085D5C39566E18CA6C96E5A08548BD4C
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
0xC3A22C30A2027D1BCE0482E1CF2B1046

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
0x9EB4D7A3FB8A0D4960E2D5EDE27D87EA
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x0C0F1B2DD3E98E1084BD43538FABF043
she would give us anything we asked for."
0x9D5557035848F72FD77028E1318F342A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
0x1DD1205F4C82645A893D9DB5AC1B1639
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
0xA1B177F38DA421702E15DEC90FFA58A9
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
0x5FBD6E62481EB04BDEC9FA37ACDF2A88
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
0x2AD3F91B86093C65C292526767E16155

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
0x976457E10C2119689DCC8F99E8374AE0
in voice to-night?"
0x766C55ECF36F8C7BA364D54FF2149CE8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
0xAB87D1C5226F0295B0C03FFD2EBF530B
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
0x6B9D2F836C3B13B192F6093EBEE816D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
0x3192DF7890AD5E6709707E24D0E4BE21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xBCAED24E21A39E558303BF7F9CF9591D
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xCC333D366288E0678ED6E2D12EADA9C7
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
0x003C4EB394367A9B9FECAFF0990148E9
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0xBA72B3A969B26E27FEEDDA131590852D
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x3C8D62530F6E0662C2DA9B1C722B1095
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
0xCA18367010514DAAE5B0C1BD0E087C98
hand."
0x578F3D88D47D02BEDBEF6698A2E1E5D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
0x75C7F9D01422CC95EFED3AE50838813F
Mr. Rochester.
0x577EC0B7C3B646400A8EC9DAFCA985EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0xDEC0AC0BEF8E56020C047BA230166849

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
0xC948C9B30A037CC563B2A7A1B7882D1A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x44E64F468502E7E690D8818F9F1D02AB
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x4FABC9DBCAD4DE23D2308DA069AEC6CA
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x171F65B03D9B47EDCFCDBABDE19B3CBA
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0xD206C94761646C58E898A55A30DB1E80
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x41F82E903FA256D9E499513C6FD5D362
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0xFC3978B2A57CC3688142E68E304703CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x043C6D8CB97DF6C226D6C54243F7B8C7
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0x8C6458BA6270ADFA1C1043DEFEB41AAA
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0xEEE209FAC15CB6021751F309AD44FA4D
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x748E8D56EE7C2320B12013294A22CB1D
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x50016FC5EEDBD0A834A1647BCB84C71D
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0x084F89F9EC37CF9E685439FCFA990B32
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x3626BE0B27BA475DCAF39AB1D451E755
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0x229F6D55107FB49AC393F5EBBDE796BC
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x23FAFD93F9F4557AB9E637BD24AB4813
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0xBC6F4966C90C2B1178B6A3FC654A796B
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0x18B5D4ABA208040E532BADF43A995017

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x1D179C4E9B2BC61409722FA52D1F36D8
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x3F1F9C7C2B3410193EEAEDD92B4D8A5A
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xD29D382BF3936CB75D89203E14B17911
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0x10300BB0886107CCA86198CDE0C8AC1B
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xE9F5D383CEF21C7302B6CF3E9CECCD21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am all obedience," was the response.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that

reason, sing it _con spirito_."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and

water."
0xF99E276C5C79B9270F6979F90AE2CB40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how

such things _should_ be done."
0x2F6AD0978479F4D5F32DCF20E2C4EBA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to

fail."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict

a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0xD4D410DBC10C460CD4606D9E13F1E9B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0xE9708AD14E069DD4BA8F9DF625296AE0
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x8F2DD0ABB95F9D6694BF3169E0530A61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x871FEF709B1CB3D64F451C27E7026BBC
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xBF30FEB91F83654AB436D7E9AB4638CA
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x5F3B5162C6E12648699539C92470AA53
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0x4D0244AC22C721408D1C14E4B1762582
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x5AF0BEB88D2614FC025BDD0747B9F213
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x8CEDEE467C66AD45A835D406E5A00DD6
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0xAE9269B0819675E12407DF8BF97C16C9
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x2DE7BA886927ED464D14B169AAFE4AC8
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0xAB57FD52A826A997D26F1B6855D7D7BE
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0xAD88F49B22657C94B71E5E55795F33E1
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xD78E22604459128F8FC83DABF0AFB16A
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0xEF255D9D8A91A3FA6044EDADD59F406A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x76D2C02DB08EAAC058C083DA8A0CF3DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am very well, sir."
0x71850FF434461EB6EEC63B7219361F67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x79855E22FAA1A590F8437FB709211D48

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x25E7EC93EEC4342D56318613507F9460
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x5EDC517928210FD6A61570FB6A70E1E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0xF5483CC7655B5FE6A02BF6E5973296D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0xD5B0B770F7DFB9A2010D212067ADD2C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0xA61738B257E65FC0DC9EF06D600816F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x7491D233790413B3D96F18E515D53BB7
What is the matter?"
0xB008B6EDB99B5352567F42DB5ADEE36A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing at all, sir."
0x6D2A0B891AD5053F7A51461C471DD1DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0xE17662CE933C49DC8312147D8F5817EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not the least."
0x6DC8471980B2906341BE7CF646D0CA9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x25A0B485907D53312634C0D910B9782A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am tired, sir."
0xBA01397CCD62BB625BDAED4EB96A7EC1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He looked at me for a minute.
0xD1531BAAA53C84371E7B052AD815125E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x7C1CCAA4E59D7B989105611EF535F595

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0xF7268A3E5E8AC7317F8E3B5F5664D330

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x4BB163A3F7E906B5A91E3B3E474976FE
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0xBFF81B60DA952926151169DB513CB5CD
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x31989E09BF872A059917C83EE8BDBA22
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x2C2B446FC4A4953FA6BC47E96F4CCDFA
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xEA4EC9AD558905449CAEB8B0D1529337
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0xB8EE610779FCD17D44C04FFFA99DA4CF
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x69844A179CA26053971A33BC0D17E280
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0xDF829174B67AF698794E0F3140179399
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
0x9F30EC90B4F4A3AC2803A39144EC02F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

CHAPTER XVIII
0x9FAD082DDDDE75A90568809137B2B840

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x819ADA1385491681C099DF082448238D
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x169DCCF1CE51753FB8D84264C9406F6B
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x1240C5F6BB657190747307127FAE36E6
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x891B9614DFB6F4E00EFD970129223CEA
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x800C42D3F7686A8ED6FB03D66E48AD71
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x299D89BE03F916BC1D6192CF97BD3B71
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x858911659D3589E28BD622B82B3E1BD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0xF63E0F674FF317F403B6B0B0E3544FE6
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0xA9608A09D6301C0C78867E489ED7BEA3
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x32AC420E8E406992F456287A85A49804
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0xBB0FDFAF82F876FB1B7D5EE31F8C9448
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0x779A4DF42C0294EAAD63B2A785F715C3
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x9824A1FCCA97AFB1FEE59463AD2C30D7
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x55D1117B8CCE68DE13750768E0D3B653

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x2F29FCB7686B1E22C8C7704DE5E06803
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0xE96CAA2C03CDAB09814E0A1C065FE8DC
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x277EA961C70A0C1C7866BAAC26727000
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x4FA9F38DCDF1A48D459DFA02660F14F2
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0x32126F13389BB097AD1915CAB641DEF3
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0xD2C07E839031B772CF351FBF798FA95F
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x499BD662711657EC71E1D281CDC81EA8
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x458858A33AAF52072F1071AA65A0C3F4
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x46C9D2EEBE8B009496D7CBE58A7C388B
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x1EF9662242F2816CE86C6CF79A3E42A3
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x0DED692154E820D4C7C54FB73AAA652A
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xA9F4AD93701CE9DAAA9FA527BDBEC81E
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x0CF9163E4E71987210E396F81707A848
drawing-room.
0x2AA6D14BA0C9078CDC1A549F99B97D1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x41364C57D9A31FA6E3BCB59C9E7545AF
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x8856E0B3C1007803DA63E4B88CE66A4F
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x031183405E6AC95ACEC582F2E8B442F8
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x786DF11FD8515F676EF66C46146759A6
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x2553B289393EAC312313747E8820D5AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xF6C0DC820A0604748C89C43ECBF8486B
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0x8A23C6C439782C1A230326BC284AFCD5
usual seat.
0xA2E3BCDA299DCADB58AF9946DD456DD3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0xD4C7F71ECD9B07DC6A86D4144E8A0633
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0xA71C4DD8D3E14F0782BD11D03D0CE311
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xE6B884A833B956399DB1F18C9CA91864
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x0B1C27C7FFC36A9380D22F415D8453D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x43923B59173D69C000D6604ADB7EFBA1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0xE9DE5FBBA37F12404AB154635B6AA204
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x843D246A0183989E60D3A0BB0E15FEF1
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xF3726C51A3A86B235E2B9991F8BC17C2
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0x374434197D23553A1A8BB12E867AA3CE
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x676A77123955E2BF8A1CDB82A7BE546F
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0xF08FA905EDD4B93D1D24DF68011A6644
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x27EFA5CBA59DFEC8C0B2C6C4BB19A955
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0x05B3D01D0915E53435E7DB683076B5E4
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x72B3D80C9FF4FB6394E788F4536DFE03
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0xFDEEE794EFE684B8B6C539F262F90D87
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0x5F84607BFF7BE323707CE5ED9789C730
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x63A71D6CC88AECEF3F978A5D79B7FD59
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x4B8A76CB48BB23CFC93FB77A667EC633
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0xE8DCAC65610E31009EAC7A8B4105E0C4
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0xFCF51377D7F0D5CB358CFC82AADD61FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0xC6487EF54AE7AD06F6942A03632BA8F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x1BED6162FFB8597CFCB8131D9676354E
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x0B57A2E634DC74F51F89853766B4BDCE
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x665397C1B4CA120434F6F9E1952F6BD9
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0xB0F0175509EB27F2C6ABBB9DE05076A4
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x4CF3661AA9CEF9BF9A4FD0CF8BE96B96
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x1803A64D81A46E250C8F1410C984B595
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x42D408CF4F43675D02C1D3FD80383A0F
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x6DB2B126ADEDC29FDC864466D9F2154D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x7D37E8A571397F426B678A56B591AC58
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x4B0E49F41EBF95CB4A7B690626360433
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0xB77C3961B2DC4D6FB50A146EE97A8AE0
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0xAD0DE652055EBD0D657BF0CAD54042A5
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0xF3EF2553F6314FC83C357CB2E9FF7995
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0x4918D12CDE7F135AC5FA0360623F59B8
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x572883170331EC7C1750D36EDCBEEFD4
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0xBDC9029C5EC51602C773925C82B78A01
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x3211984C88E7188F4E917FF353DE41DD
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x4C68A4887E27C931A03E503F84FAD341
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0xFC3D5D0170FF20610CA1D167D9397AC6
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x9BA776AE526B3FC26395CD89E6824B29

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x8EA86FE6C65605D40118E0558DE6025D
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0xF029DBF381BBC953329EC1F77BD00AC0
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0xF4ABD80C1EA5A28C98BC01972A4F25F9
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0xCBAB4AA9EAB27757CD20717950C0B2D0
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0xF5FCCF5C4AC848337B32660A49F7A851
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0x6F5FE222D6BDD2650CF03A36E2B03F50
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x2944E83F55B7D171EAD331E6F348AC3D
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0xD7A97B53AD84274FCB133E3C7FEB0A5C
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0xDA04F3190668C645394F2194F9CE6657
wanting.
0xD3DEFA8306C5839B28E2C026848B8BD6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x73BFD61C1842759893D63D105CD65CBA
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x2B632D0136DFC502E10FD9DC80408923
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x2704B4482848DE04EF6C6111973A475E
curtain again descended.
0xBFC53FDCF5EDBBD4129680D495A091F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0xA10366C1E74A8C59A447CE8FFD00FE71
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x4C15A4143BF31F1F7B8677BED49828D4
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0x1A6E63F04B52AF4D6761791A8165B987
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x42F19E954EC4A0704830FF92D1BD13F1
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x7F144641284ACC95B5B2DDE349EB04D5
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x286024C2A97EC171285D6C014B5645D2
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0x341A6CDB5A276EE1B0AE49FC1C161EE6
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0x7CC61490A21B5DDB89C984C13949CB68
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0xEBEEFD3D019979F81BD0AD2AB7672F38
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0x70BFFC17C1E4742B07E92E2BCED2E55A
attached fetters.
0x31BBB6BFCB2D5609D3EA42ADA0818AC8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0x4F167F401E92A003C517AE884FC9C189

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0xAE6D40A480975FD742FFB23E023E988E
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0xBC5E0D6D3332DD58927BBFF088DAE45A
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x87EE0D2F4B615126D776A0E2714FEB82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0xB0968B4EC5775F8027E29DA2A78C87B3
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0xBE50A08D173345C35D5F08944CF2115E
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x84D892C5C41E83DD5E6214EE1BBC1C2D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0xB61B66CB219BBFA9EEC1611B7BB73877

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x6356BB5CB61ED85FC4E0BB0B74091097
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x540B500ECC76E1BF65CC3BBBF3B50D55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0x2867713F24FAF127FA1ECCAF8948AF62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x5B5026C377333214ADBE0B8D7A5BCE6A
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x9FF1A4E55EB10A3DF19FD8BD6C64E698

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xE99E0FE6B8BE9C1FFEE68DB00E773112
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0x9FC030D3441BBF799886EE27089DDBA7
colour rose.
0xB67218C7673DA757DC6BAADC0B90C10D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xFA3946ED2A98AB6DB46BF9962D25CA21
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x6D6E5A1119EAA4762F733A2D1F1FDA16
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xA689AE3F874C82ACA10DA9C4DF8C4370
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x4271E70EE3311FDD619E6E0A4EDEC828
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x70148514E526F35D5EF00A6CB070D625
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xCA3AF7D95B85319B14A3530461C51B24
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x6DDB4F52389B1C10DEDA4958320B811D
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xDEB3EFA781604290129EED4164EEDF12
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xF5A8549F1C3644E6B07E6D1CF310FCC5
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0xC75FE56B0AB0EC72E0B186405C3479A2
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xEFE59BF26CF2575B2DFE944726AF685F
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x3E25C9771FBA74C2C354F5B9AC5683D5
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xE94E1A3EBC62D10DEE6F1E5B249A464B
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0xFBD294667BD42D27CEC6B26FEF6C9E4D
returns in memory at this moment.
0xFE2280EEBA0ADA878D5E6E4AD4D78CD8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x8CE02EB4192C2C4649175543AC5BF447
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0x727B5A00F7633A3D67E7B561B480E7E2
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x0ED639D7E9E23234CD0965A21E004E1E
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0x55BFB6DC765ED60ADE6E75B803E1430C
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xE8B282D7889513CB21C13D394B81077D
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0xFA4FB50D0190F4190A097A90F24506D2
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0xCEFFF8D621A89DE00AC896F196A70C90
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x589B67636BC12E3C0E4A9221DAF3C7E6
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x28421457C5DD49B218D9FC46866766CC
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x8A30E67BF7B1F4512A1341B2F4F4EFFB
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0xBD0CEAC7BC3BCE2159169708A2A2954B
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xD543A1498EBDA6BC6D573A991CCF9508
very pride, irresistible.
0x97B14B8BB2767DCFE7DC684658B1EE47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xE1FA58D89D277FEBDC77FB1E5B116E57
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x70161453AB13D06216297EA3080274C6
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x017F91AACDC5F0BF87C4DF195B1414F3
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x4BEAF6C0E8D3F336D841D33A50C9AE6B
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0xD0B9A8C39F3CAB49D2832B4DC97B5C47
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xFAB3628AAC10DC453D9E855FF0BFDCE7
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xA9A4C59BA3F12A0A388942FE77B804EA
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0xD4B1EDFC39E095D8D508EA86FC00B97E
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x92D479C60279370491153BA7BBDF9CEB
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0xBDD576813A2A48D44FA55389EA770C79
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0x2224449F737DEBA5A8B59952EE58E74D
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0x6A93EB068F4C23323EF2F368D3D7127C
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x873C4930C4735FF877E7B640673A97EA
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0xFE0974AC68ADA05B36C0937B3F2A2D25
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0xCD4BCBE087396C782B825ED46F5EC521
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xB2659FFF0C5CF2B6B6DAB515BEF1C2C7
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0xC768CD865512371C97564CE976B21907
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x0EEB6BE6C5F0345F60CB1BEB91462663
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xE8A4CD122FDE5D738083583268312573
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0x1500797531BF6817F3615AD4C161C969
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xBEA16DE8AEAAE3FE10E2C7D88053DC34
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x606AD8F6A18A21EFAD8B9CA6DD395A76
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x8904D9E36A1A4D88F53582E26BC676FD
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x41618EF526F9FBDBE5F79C2C823913D1
torturing pain arose.
0xDB046CA95CC4C4E1A589045D682FE0D9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0xFB904DA86C700E4B6B0F660B1FAF3D39
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x927571092D0282BC825823F202AF9B58
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xD11BD0577FA9A6FDBF74DA9E5EAA41A7
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x3CE3C3B0F07A76FCA3F314BFA2C07804
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x2C1F0D8E17BE31ADA81D663A2A20F47C
not charm him_.
0x396333C0521F6044BE60DC8A541191C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x98409280058BCBB0F1523D376B521F75
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x51DBE2E483BDFF938DAF597549751C49
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x77B3BE3DCBF07EB737540C47F287B22E
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x4CB7D45645E50E59F2C1C88A05241CF3
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x22CD75DFFE9E9BB765F98A6A67546132
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x8424F963A150558CB4D9BC262DD1D436
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0xAD218BF31EF1E28BB8FD009041D655C2
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0xEDFDDCC6C8B6461B7264277B30AB1860
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0xF8F18E2679A56B3E68BC5BDFFFF6F94E
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0x96E4204D334FB0F6BDC7BC8AEF613E02
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x5CC81EBF37E7F8EDEF25AD723EAA2EDA
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0x367C46C7861FB110EC2554BF9BEB9ABB
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x1094DB770A9D25EB8911F3D46AA68F37
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0xCEE3DB709518B638EAB5EDA53414CA50
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x7184025A6C27B9FAE2064872A3B5FD8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xC87800FBA5CF92A6B571C8077C18BAE7
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xF89EB948B4E04D64B4EC8EA4F12026BA
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xD961881A9EE9A2E1A03958BB5B7040EE
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x0724E16EDB27F68324136D66ABE499BF
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0xDB2B06535AE91CC64C897A19ADC16A84
silent conquest might have been won.
0xD8A75D24EC12F92551C19FD4974719C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xB547F529511D2E93458682F347CBCE10
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xE351BC094CF27C78C40243D0164A312B
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0xCEEF77A4C1CE6B2F41066767C1434A2A
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0xCAD54784B28A7CFCCB76CA09289B62A6
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xD2BAC9EB3C916A79F0E5655BCECB3088
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0x6602D482A55E01A0C5224CC0E6A6EA59
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xE04D413D363F6E53955C8D51E4F0263A
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x03572DBB3846A013C59A951D740C7600
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x2B03597B11384DCAF73FA7305CDF6205
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0x4584BB7D6871DCAC6C6E359107FA3846
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x9F814B4EDC903A3D53BC92349E86E2A5
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0x7853BD3D21CA0F6A14E773D0C0B9B3C0
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0x8C6AB718149D235533F5920BFB42CD93
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0xD9EF9855E9C27A105721BE2BA98A8E6D
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x07F29E2D4BDC1582DF8B9DD10506C909
shines on."
0x829A2314D618BF7CF2919F75937971E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0xD369876DE284F12FF14CE53834648032
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0xDFE235E1528D5129D32276F4419610CD
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0xB4CB960975A2D60CF55406724D396EF5
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0xEE0FE34BD57F2EFCF977D9E2BD10A61E
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x21B46FB9E6E6BE51697BE04FB02D85AE
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x9C8BB0A02E1E2FE0249F97BD9DD3B743
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0xE11751D30DABBAFAC1CB44F574D50146
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x3609C2276CEB5DD7296AD965079E3627
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x38DD340D41249322A8C10C86649A2D47
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x99052A3E6F0F36B780B22A93084086CA
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0x1B39C6DEE5AAE97863A1778BB5A47804
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x3CC2BAA44BBC2C371E68F5EA37BA631B
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0xBEB06057147066114C6D5C67380C0238
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x9C400D92141243D8DF859730891F8E8C
as I wished to act.
0x1C0BE1C289D2661E4DB4AF2D888B4B28

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x9F40E4F05CAFD25AF648F5DD548A97ED
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0xE146AD43E3A6A739F6B5DF07739AF2A9
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x93F16A9D2E5C0C11EF7E535DF4536AC5
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0xC200307D8A106526617979CC84A72EB0
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x75DDFBE53818B8721FE72E6D300E4BA2
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x4D23E65F5640C12D33DE64D296109861
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x293F8B1698E141B13594B8C54E526501
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0xF0D5A19D69D809B996FD5DDACCE0675D
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0x953ADFC8453A96191E7A001591355385
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x35DB72D6C07B234B0DCA026FE366760A
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x81D8C89353E66F94D9DE97F9287E95E3
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0xBA79EEC09CBAABA1493B47C9F52507B9
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x42B7332C30CC0D2A893131E677B7D546
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x430DA0768AE2F4A832A65D11557F2A11
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0xA84C4E80EC0CDD4C22140E6C4DCAFD68
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x19E44F288F44E56C8898BA82BD964C04
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x211CA5835FFE483F91C78D32FFF249DD
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x8889D9A3C91DCCFED1499C2E2E08E098
nature.
0x1578C0CDBAE620789FDDB7699CE72E00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x664DAAE8BC2F84DD90EB90E752078DBB
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0x84812F8DD10BC56CFDBCE84EEAE935D7
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x188F6AD5A1A079FD9E9835EBC2F77A3E
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0xC8356B172A02AA52D50CADEFA2370F57
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x93BC6CDFF453A6DAA24D927AAA007C5A
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0x0B20F39AC2C96177B87FECCE8A635E5D
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xF07763390F306413FCA3D2E773E7E5C0
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x00454F2A81AECB79D8A5BAB0EC52BEAC
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x67662C4E27D17B9DA652D8EAF6CAD89D
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0x75E62B344ADD86CD1E1DD9644AC04A2B
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x93EAFEDC26C1AE1E690F7DCD065A4C97
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x1865504090C91D18E4DC0A30D473FEC4
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x8EF718663B879CE7CC02319FB7B23235
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0x4008F7460D10B4EF63B577BF8D0E2CAD
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0xD6E31F43DA0DEB9EF258FD8BD8E0FB3F
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x014FECC2B0C002B370B9E1155BDE8B4E
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x7C1FCFA2760B01686A5159F31B2D7E52
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x80239FE95D6C79A8D0316674C3326175
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0xE9EDA697FA6BC96D464519A6C94854F3
vivacity of conversation.
0x4D97300460B90EAC38F88EC274AC66F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0xFB230737E2777D6CF745853AF808D0EB
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x63E7851657A95F878D96CAA312F15EFD
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x91803CB487CCE6412E1B18E33AEBFD18
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x8B8382FE9C20B12BCD8A4A4BB1729CFD
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x21D998E4D724DDF9ACAB44EC8401CCB3
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x3631ED62AE7FC1BF5A2E632A148D3752
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0xF57D39ED3FDEA32923180B38CD07A181
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xCFAD3EA3B2AA65C7061AB00C0B01BC3C
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x2D631225049C4966A356DA6935815FE3
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0x817A5DDF10B628D93B2947EFA8077C44
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0xFFC3A9BB3B5837989663CE0A882AC449
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0xB632F8EDA9790B633FB4B50E7197680F
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0x5206EDECD17D9767CF1CF7B7E181A081
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0x73B9DCDB9A4F541B1518CA6CF3416892
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0xD52099F27300662CB38BBFE8E12F2A78

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0xD662F5A67129C2F9C8D3526C1D3984FB
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0x44BFC0D2010DA925989E7A97844085CA
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0xC224285783BE17E8632D28C57A6A0AA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x0946904A2D3749E62B7CD793046ED0D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xDE98FA7AF5ACCF6892764077BB0B2F46
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x05E28FC49C90841B3A556D20792FCA2C
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0x0A72F66CF19BD89ED45AA0B3856A58E9
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0xDFCBADD63DB32CAA82B35F4CE2C1D067

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x5C2B677CED0106B0425B486CA1D61F6E
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x9CE6E104535765CAE93CA761587FACB1
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0xF7AA5A86F25762A3C5F55E3543175908

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x9259EDBE9D009313D5ADCDD5E77CAC0B
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x488019A546A7466DD5EF7E2083239CE3
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0xFA888B577C56D9D649FBBA931A2374B4
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x2DBC4194C3727124616B0A69FD9B8AF7
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x3D5BAE6AEC63493F07ECFC188F3F7970
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0x44F12901DD90534AC9A035C0B04CE205
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xE75F8588D35EECFB0AFDDEA40C4017B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x126CA6FDE1B6E79D042397ACF87EF520
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x155DBAD83693BF2030A8A85FB02FD5DC
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0x9A1E1E8FF742B6337DB47B348E9D0AE4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0x96F0CDAD2E53A13043AC941BA693F594
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xE7FC95D61D77E8919A2B9D31A7BED7F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x3803BD26C526548BD2A79BA5473DA497
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x531B8952C0D16A60B0973A209D73F0BB
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0x644F5EA594947E993E46A0016B212FAF
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x5F120DDA39620BEF015C168A43727174

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x16D62E65AFA9F9C06B749D899D96C01F
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0xB38C538131DD093C51FA9085E77E930C
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0xD63D769D1C26CC8F1933F8CD7523282A
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0x62B30119BC5E576739D244A350BDE254
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0xAEFF649F0D816F7CC21B1D6DE0763C6E
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x76CB9C84FF1D94816303EBB9947C750E
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0xF3F9C62DEDCD9640F37ED6C830B96EE2
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x04AC24787F0E777746F0CB5A48AF8760
least so I thought.
0x282B8B08F4F6D8378C5095FF9395BB75

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x3F924EB93A07954CEF5E0E9F7551EF35
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0x9A53D05F6F44F5F90F7C6E3A5354C81C
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x7D5DAE63B5336ECF07CA2EF71CF19E40
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xEE3563A2D8E2E20BB125901BAA6DC427
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0x5378B9AC4EEC531FBB185254D5DD0770
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0xFD0F4F9EC97E5054F716A4905CD51856
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x1F353103391606C2C11E271FEDFD57AA
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0xA00ACE3C1150715570FCD051A85E370A
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xEDE257A97D3016DD83CD9C84B4972473
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xDE7EE3D872E2C847D216B92FF9428E26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x408F844251A6ABAD2C56528CF0CD49FC
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x9A2475685408234B388BA075EA183517
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x9FD33BA80C62249BC5B94ECADF91096D
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x3BC232B1B63EF3920E98B1AF61E1A531
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0x0FDB5B36FDA975E07F765CB651171F66
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x9CF4BC02DC258C4E2AD34216ADD5052B
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x9255F3B65C4714E6AEA0AF7F8997484B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xAD741E0EADEFA1BCE2E2D7ABD12D5291
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x27BB89A59957F19B77CCCB2DE17D21BC
that "extremes meet."
0x82C604EF74D010B8C3CBF0825D55BF68

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xE0AFE0159E6B922B1519845774C95BC7
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x36D1471996CA152E6CCC6BF783F8ABE1
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0xC0D888C1B857D5BF60BF127E7329E0AC
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0xB2DE30467CDE4CA598CAF37C42FC128A
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x3F033922C2C113EA14D47DC00228F637
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0xA791A62AB211D9184A595290944BB228
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x93A1CFC79C799E92F1E8B1D1CE2BC24C
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x910790863B88181BACE6C881FEFCCAF4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x9BF31E4588A56862EB4E0C5B7EF6B8D2
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x874A0A6C1E184009274B8EB3335E56A4
a placid eye and smile!"
0x16D653D83AFBFC669E5FDB683E6B6872

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0xAA2D9E9D348E8D5DD951953F013A5C01
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0xC9876DFBD510908AE76F72E2E87C5E4B
Hay Common.
0x9C2579E5A62008E8372D3BCECEF0F3DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x539D4E2DF8D5B89D038113EE4505795F
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0xB478525C6FA8F3D370C861DF7EB07C6F
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0x3580B00B1219F7CA614E79CFFCA95B5A
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0xE26A1D5A98EBCAA23EF08A66B1DC122F
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x6DF9B2F583095A70E68EA95752B3ECFC
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xBFA32C44A69B1DCA9D0B3D45A1C92B66
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x292A965AC204E10C800E9B8E1255C69A
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0x9DD4FAD4CBFC0F873014D5AF754971BD
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0xF179F9D89BD048C4CC3318DBF663CFC2
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xF11F797073C7E5A784C35BE0C8DF4BC4
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x8C57287FA570069902D7116FC509545D
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0x66442760AA2548C87E5FF70AC1CD3745
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x690AE99EE5F6C2417D0C6DAF4062B720

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x2E8A2A900BC25B4F5DBFB8FF7FA00417
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x07DF3A587AB0318056B86C8BDAD4B2A8
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x7F05F34D0BF1DDA7796D2476D7E5F7A2
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xD36353E848BE6962CC3B6FAEFAC4352F
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x278B8D6B79BEF7DD4D6D3EB820CC2F27
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x8AF6807B4CF7F85544277D874237B2EB
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0xBCEA5F3D3516E691C366A487D9029592

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0xB352A35D2FE32F1385B070C869F6592F
off," replied the magistrate.
0x5EB18A2BAF0720771087B3CD5C69E119

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x07A1F36001949EB40B83BD12D16D9540
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x0B4DF8FD0F0BA005D16EB4F5F4F80225
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0xD3E2C71501F5F8158B6C54AA86541E71
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x2D1BC79EDFB67A504C6DA7ACFB963BC3
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x5A0E92E7CCBF5B6F6251A0F85C9B70AE
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xFD8BE058E8779E91B8A7E88A659AEA04
see her?"
0x57C09EA393DBF89299DA2B885DE55156

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x95BA4A0EC40F4CF1D5DF8A8FFC5F390C
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0xDE80B9505016013C7203B3497B650A00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x62E7049948D049F1FF099B649963C8F4
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0xC509DA3FCCCDA2024BDFF29ACBE97293
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0x88D729AD4D5C51A09B53A78B91BBC4D1
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0xD70C9663E92D2D12CE28691A9014198E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0xA29B70B294F171AD0965214C5A3648D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x4C65F742A9F0267E6F284B3BBEB59602
must and will do it."
0xDDD623E990085E0A1F66C434CEB7AFA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x25D45ACAAE8A36B10E3AE4E21BC0B0D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xB453D596219EDBB64B07F50B88972929

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xE4E3331F4C3F50F51C60775859057319
in, of course."
0x1906A775746ED0EEDB987FD883736063

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x7D5F8D117C72EA20B1EF3EF6DEC0BFFF
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xA5A706F3609FB3CD88193F22941BC880

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0xADE5A683A4E8D30920FD74301040AB64

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x6B5329AA2691FC1D4BC2902CAA36BA61
in the Dowager Ingram.
0x529851DE3CD5CD3FCF4BF016B32710F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0xDD39DEDDC9898E4C8722332A10C4ACEF
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x9BF0DD85121EC83BF7FD6FD39B85C8FC
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x53D80DD09CB627F0CAEAC312FA2E0AFE
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x5F3AE2223259B57C56CE0F501E5EB730
forward."
0x1926BA8B514B83092A2861ABADA4EA7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0xB36465F84E5BD93DD73B72030275C09A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x0F0920DA171F98EDF1D6A4287AB5C7EE
Sam!"
0x36215A1D4E94AD3E527D15E58E1FD831

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x7DAEE042BF9DE500199BD7EE763AB184
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0xF542E142822FDB3555D00DC3CCB71D53

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0x93DA93EC5F3B1AD90F2FE9D9957EC860

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x70BC731772CACD0B256D7A871E050D23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x18DB8C84E4364CC02C5A980CAE94EA15
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xBE910014F27B84E865EA17CE96F90B9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x97E15C34FE7EE31C839E0B8B294B2A26
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0xB6E3778292574FF1BBCC2A7AFACE5D15
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0xBDA581FE6BC2F6E51CFE5D2E07F38B9C
one."
0x67163C75329CF469C35BEE2EBCDCB4F2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0xB0601FCEEA13B225A7BCC831E284BD98
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x23A5D70D81EB76EFA4839A17CC538D7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x3D76FAB4AB8951CF07234721491DF454
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x7A6E873F900DFBD6A7D6F4A6F0A59CC1
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x2B26B1229C906394B76FD6359B89AF3B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x2CBD47F81D83ED88631BD918CCD0A40F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0xB971776AC16A21E79F270D9AA2F2392D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x9DCD2C0B0D969B839FFEF05A218C1955
once more.
0x0A901B4BFFAD95A3E2EA541DBD9E35C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x342B22DB1FD7FD685AD9FE42BBB66FEC
know who will be her first visitor."
0x1B7F4D5FF238775234725D0590FA96AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x3AB0C5A29AA676C58692012E99DAF2BF
said Colonel Dent.
0x5E43E30513FBC8880E5C990ED23AC09E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x66CAA74B967DC3F4FF71AE65329EC9CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sam went and returned.
0x95091E4D3C78F4B8E00FCA6A458C2810

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x30E1C9A2F0249E428353FD56DBB6595C
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x999010DC36A2F7FE8BA490DA6B64843B
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0xF4E7877C6773171DCD210E17C0629FA0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xE87AB018CEE117EE07E825E6AC31F306

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x9D503640DEA0B86A96C1E7854EB7E834
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x1830E0F025DD442AD186E08D4D418DF6
of his men.
0xC58919822626C0DF63A934CED3B6969C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0x17AF6AD74F9F8A92136CDD08DDB36C5F
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x8831CB77ACF342144C02564C16279396
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x687348BE3F0082376F938CF4842D9466

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0x7761CC082B20574CE6410CDDF0C2ABE2
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x6E5026EEB0C7A6E479B256C902E44494
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x760AF472223A3349CCE239FD618FBC91
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x8B0D0D6C0FD9C5FB478C3B61ED634097

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x77B1A4DBDBA148A5D31FFF82852E27C6
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x6BCB658E4BE31AE6C23869A9070F804A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0xC20C10DA30B19001702494C0449B8234
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xB52DF8DD3FB256BB2B795CBC6C1931E9
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0xE379AAEF53195631C2E86E87ABA27A7C
her seat, and took it in silence.
0xD88B2E79AED31953A8EC62E7037E8B98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x81D658D66FD1B1CD07F84723EEBDB2C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x8CC368A8D6849D4648953040AFF5E5BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x918F6A269ED6BA0AA6CB36413003D76F
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0x5AB47BB5B7E0D588C699EC75E05FD876

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xEA4E54F27341ADB715C7BE0E86F3DA6F
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x7B59722920B52B3E6A5007C94A7968D2
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0x7064997FACF08661857F51181F938CF6
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x53460A8333173124B3BF109538AA0E43
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x8CA26073763435C1D3E0E7ECEBCD4693
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x89598D7D0AC3FBABB767EF69B5599949
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0xA4A827C08A8821B66C3E3A57C40883DF
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0x586E18006697D23A6696A13373343A60
morning, as he threatened."
0xC8557EE2B0871070C492E0642B933461

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0x02B9EB590BE68893310D1D3A38300A61
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x8496CCF15AEBACDAA52A8391EFC23B11
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0x824927FFD7C0759373F8D54C2FD3096E
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x6824197D6F29D457CBF80949FEEDEEA1
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x91059C1EB2443B37082F74790DA576DC
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x9AA1E68838E47F1037DAEDA9094A3F1F
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x9D0EABF9755AD5E9320337B4BEE60C90
whatever revelations had been made her.
0x1F26EBBE2065ABB5B046E3461FBD1A27

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x056D6AEE4A88569B48FA841252148C79

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x63349DC0BF215B70777F0CE7E795E670
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0x552DCD0ECFFBFDE74F837735F75480C0
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x3C3C905C3E4D7A3E2DD24252CF351253
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0xF5F981186CA0968848D984887E501694
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xE49B1AC90B1EEFF5E4A6C6D7BF04B027
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x263B7263576011501FA78B08627A6EBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0x7DCF54E32283330AFEBB7E737D44C3E4
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0xD42E81D938E5D8898CCE61F73FB0BD03
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xB2F594B61C00A8105500317DF5A881F6
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0xB42EF47F99D551645DBC4DB097044230

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0x769A56B2F0E6EC8E6C333FCF47C1D602
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0x146BE7313D18B91F41E16C3388810A7D
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x8DB7A52B27020A15FFF2E8340E655136

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xAC8FA83357617B5FC47F1282A60218E5
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x2E44E35B6F6EA6F5026C8F1164E6ACA7
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x66A9607B97825E10690B0BF07BA0E6CC
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0xB96F4FAA2FF0E6E4DC0B39ACD6713D2A
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0xF4B12561FFF18EB60778DDC7EFB31E9E
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0xE934F788625D0E6EFAFC96FA4C0F84F7
they most wished for.
0xB6953E9121ABC6DBBEFD38C2D0F5568A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x6CD3E4A543213E7A19FFE1219EA880DE
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0xA8310E3E36FAF57D12E24134A51DEC9F
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0x9C26E8B86334DF124EF328AA9ABC532B
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xA7EF4EF670ECC4E62F3B059CBEF7682A
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x04D334DF50022AA901B2519D7EF129CB
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0x04A16FDEF226929168DB14382BCE72EE
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x7810C1098E255FD74E84BC2D41F57CB7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0xA0FEBBA1F0B68A11B0607D0D9A9F49FA
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0xCAF3EE37ED15431607B9CC2BF2454AD4
saw Sam.
0x0B523CD6D9375EC71631079B42DE1C1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0xA9229C33473FDF88E886756534DD7EB3
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0x935848AF21032EEA9F52F98ABFEA6F39
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x69F94EAA58D54056D6BB9BB8D78CD9B9
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xF841F55302614A860CB81BB433147B81

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0xE75CA980ED0F15ED7FA52489684C276C
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0xE1BC7FFAB186B6B169F63D6E6B39F7CC
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x23D144CEFAFCC90A10FEFB38600575E2
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0xEFAEAABC9081E5A826A8DC6494053C04
quietly behind me.
0xD4F5EF82BC6175D0AC076B932623C91B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0x1D7C12F6B3114787BAA39B2BCE346323
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0xDE92471B8E3E79DD903C7720D431A7A9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0xAAC25692C1A6865162426C185B8D5EB3
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0xAADBC7666575D7C52D56AF37DB5881A2

CHAPTER XIX

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0xF0F63C701A0A10972883DDA81A2727FA
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-

corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x84BAA144E0534B579BCF1F265AA9AB45
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x850A74704D18425C409F4A0769EC04C7
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xFB902E20B98AF176E0BE68616D0B4AC0
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x0BB37CC7BC5427062A158397EFE7F734
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x392A762F4A1C35828326E923C8D17AFB
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xE6B5C6E2E1669FA98B5B5128393A3C34
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0xC96D9CCDDC5B8BC83E115B8F463A62F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x18DD3979D484FCDB1266E8FDDE655E83
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0xC73DD533679E382C182BFD421F4A3772
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x85F699049CD3238025D9FF0E4AF56FF1
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x9DAA3236C4035BA42F44AD0B9389A56E
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x76E8B1C848033F699232E3485912D0E7
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x0111592BE4D4CD5A1062CCB3499BA1F2
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x063B42E068F67E2B7F2DFF3D475C8508
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0x3ECFC4D2C0EBBADD3679911006F94C0E
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xBBB1B5121D78D4738A2D38ED0E45E2A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x0FF58BA133F15AD75B716B260283A3CE
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0xBA95737C596FACED9E3AAF87AE77B752

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x51947CDF74E3C12E0F1790CCC9E68894
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0xA0A13E8610C978AD0D863C4BEC04C28E
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0x5905A316EB55510ADD5E749C90E5A73F
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0xD5AA1FBAA189F8024B85917FEE5C147E
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x3B44D95B51B0386B897AD13CC9F9E375

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Prove it," I rejoined.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0xAC6A6DA05012FD8486E49BAFF7B7C31E
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0xD0247A3583E0C062D981466AF2976981
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0x521148F8FCF224A7F7AAE372E4765493
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x1775EFFDAAB8766B6F7408E6D41668F6
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x9B4B62FBEE8FFA7715E8CDC35110AEF3
you."
0x143A288514ECCC2502581C586050AC5F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x5B2D155FE3738A4048FE89488A2E7F27
with vigour.
0xF7A006D7C07983F34C828CF3C1B939F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any

0x706CDB2F88372B2ED0AC1888E51984A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0xC64ED596DBA7EAAFBD604EFDD398B2E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0x2E02694F6E69EC76303CDCA76FD403F3
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x140C0AACBF1D390B969F094641A8F04D
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0x97FFBD168B506F5147416D4559E21501
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0xABC40D4B8F6E506F323A8B0A0DE8D35F
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xD7372B443875485B0FD85009B7631D3A
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0x0A66BC4825BDA1E2F7E5C0744087C66E
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xE9A7227FCA022D2D1196CB1469627B4C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0x8065C73D48E9D0C322E2D0C28BD07973
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x0C50D31F433996FE5123A47089ADBFA7
there."
0x28EA96FE59261C4F30CE642DCB060528

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe you," said I.
0x035DAE59D5489BD680BCD0220671E2A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x06B4F7C497BB50D440754A6C7DD14A4D
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0xBC3FC950F39BCE6F5D7CA27793E55E14

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0xE14F0B21BE3A135D24A6C4C7358410E8
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0x732AA0A89CB2F753AA42CC144180BA74

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0x079106695C69E148F173246678E04B6A
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0xF09FC3320D4F8F9DF1891F194E0F3D61
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0x830771C3D43F8241843716D11B7D2D09
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0x5EF23A4DCEC9C98B14357B711277B4BE
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0x91A3C8CD3265CB7D8EC8A9E93622564A
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x15C9C3EF9907C438959226E1D7EEAFA9
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0xBEB0D3F25784FDDF8CDFBA91F0FF3FEF
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."

whispers of the future?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to

set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."

Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,

as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but

still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0xE7FADF4040881F124A02478AB9E79EA0
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
0x10FCDEB964318F4243D8BD868D1B727B
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and

I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her

noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;

it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically

turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0xFAB050AD061E350F4596A47B066B1D9A
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I

looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,

0xC30200A53D0A00697C7C2739E0DEB23B
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0xA6A304C89A422A272B2EC3AF28B63023
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0x887DE0A22526998E1C0B37A13E15515A
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0x745F785D0299864D316F85781DA9F426
never thought of Mr. Rochester.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x8AAB6FC1AEEA8080A0107A8E62765905
signify?"
0xF83DB7C9325B4D9EFF9A41709ADCC9AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0xC57103A9F4BF7AC015E3D294C5BA5863
now, I suppose?"
0x49A12B308CCBE88381A0C3818DD8B076

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
0x498351C4583A0641FB18E9ED167ED2E7
yonder are doing."
0x056AA387B69E237C5FEF75F4E3F64D56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
0xF2B85D8D28C0A969891D53022ED7BFC8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
0x8FE27E7227D9DF7629DE7B7D5C0A8BBA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x8DCF4E4F72AA1FDF10416549DF46C017
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0x9338B2A58B6535B4C15E32AD7CF9ADF6
left this morning?"
0xD233195CB42B716867D00EA5B9570B09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
0xAB6573EBB25C7B612F12E2083CA083CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
0x8C2E8E9634B960E23250046CD146A026
installing himself here till you returned."
0xF07DF1E2BCE501DB6A275BF0A0A63348

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0x719239170A2E03FCAFEEF1FFC5AE16ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0xA5E42A6EDCF242A37C833096DCE8B4DE
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x5273DFCB60186D2F409B838D0CE066FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x1EDB5771BFE2927562D8B333F2686EB0
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0xBD2E3D96C7B92D7DD8B2DEF5AFD321F0
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x0128550F148E136FC793403D6373A9E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x7A7549FADB62254B3D57BC1BBA5E8517
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0xDFEA0B663E6BC0B3A82ED97A1C2F3ED4
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x8215C690C19DF05EDC701FD8AB941F04
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0xDC522B2D590E95B2A0FA91F0CC6942EC
seemed to know what he was doing.
0xA42C65EB8972976CC150E7A46A306568

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0x0AF360EE4E18EC7FD6931C0EA1B90A03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x4ED766EEF5811D884B832A4BBDB4CF54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x95F725142FB48620786DB0994673094E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x98FEB6EA2BF23A4C92CB6F2066D97A18

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0xE3EE13D19A4E9BD8CED83CC1FAC53740
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x159CD42508C350FF0FEA5B012E1E944F
and dreary look.
0x63A9915A8E10E4545A69C58920B46DB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x62CE2D1EDA32F79EA790B06952AE57FC
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x868B3C3EC9FD3AE0352B1404BBC2E4B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x1EB02DCB2DCF50BB183141253264E26A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x4F919734FB3AAD12FA01819CD0404C8E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0x4AD2C44050C4A291C5530E1497751884

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x388F3EFBD54A5F88C3D6B929926CEFE8
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x14FD3A71CB7B34AAD10CF48D064BD9E4
doing."
0x1ED4056C4A2304E42D160CF3B901865C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x7A1D27D8FE3648C14ECEB11FDAFD2C80
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0xCC6161E9A6592CC72BEC5C5F88F99AE8
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x15772494D21935F737212C14AF43C597
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0xE3865F2C86A385D971D778D2A16F54D0
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xE9D261837862E0912AB874F818097715
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x363EF25519BEF8ABC3B90A16887FA0BC
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0x6279B0255D48C0DCC59CFEB4898BA289
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xF34C5579A416EFC2638E653D64AAD879
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0xCCE99FA759FF454BEBD36AAEB7859ED5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x77DC7CC9CDB40E057CC4B0865F82B0F9
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x1F951316D4A880ABEEE8C36D6F6140CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0xF64D96255581ED9F2270B46DB7ACBF18
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x6B76BA39B5038D998D24D21F01F577A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x9C25AE376CC940232A9EC5237EBDA34A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x7054657B4609B9C124DF8F96CBACDFA5
strange?"
0xBD8C0DB289262CF8A6896055E7E49C96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0xE233193824904137FE5342A1F445A5CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And Mason?"
0x159CBEAB0671B9BD5C3B3F06824EA621

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He was laughing too."
0x277FD76F69FE36059660C3C01E309219

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0x6ABDF2E23CBB8BF6E5E1F5823902CE43
Jane?"
0xEB01079DAAC33704C785088F3C344535

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x9F505F7B178DD816FEB012640E742C03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x0EE16B00955A99FFB8A9480856CA506E
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0xB63472297C4ADA7E16929AE028044D99
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x250C100FFC5CE9B19F0F99B2518844DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x0C97EC416930757B649C858F2F6EE9DF
you."
0x143A288514ECCC2502581C586050AC5F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To comfort me?"
0xD44E43E596013CDF10A113CD89A79C45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x750AB1E0FFCDB86CD73143B0FD304598

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x17538BAEE66ECBC11830C380D366A406

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0x89ADA3BAE331C567B53915013FE9C34F
care nothing about it."
0x38A747327BD3819A57200AA3C15DB139

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x7F71996F3684E53558AEB22A9776B557

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0x988C79ABF1EEFFD351B541E814D81C16
you, I am sure, do."
0x637786FE4F872DCC6694669A73DCF664

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xE001CA1E97E5559DF640430E53E9D01A
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x1E6F2F69742884A9818A2C6D93B2DB51
and then leave me."
0x4758A83A90C1B814187319ACFB32AF90

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xD1BCCC80A1A68F539178B80DE9A649EF
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x98B2DE0A5110EF230938EFE504511610
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x940FD603AC47607AC7433DA3402DE722

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x2395A2579AA9A5A6BCBB71CF586D18B5
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x76ABEC3190D49A761D9D5B66381E621B
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0xCB7F8D1292114B60AADCF2CD92690419

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xAC45A157AE2AD265D90E7818B405D1E7
asleep.
0x37FF2498B6B069A640385EEA5DE9F422

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

CHAPTER XX
0x921E3B46B152A19A8044BF6294ACB932

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xEBFB7559053F716050D6F41691318B11
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x32ED341DCDA1E7BC862EFB1FA7E92411
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0x9231EDE9BCAEECFE064A8F7DB9497AEC
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x10D50C89BD6A5FC7824B2B9437A83D40
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0xF2009D383E65D3BEB37A4C472C7E5871
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x9A357FF4DC49C6BADD2698B824B4AE9F
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x71074BD97CD0727803B6E51D8F70C1F6
the curtain.
0xDAFD5CEF1D489E0AD025519A3CE305DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Good God!  What a cry!
0x4986CB352881F7626307DB7B14C40FA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0xF85F3A4227517C6995D80F06DEE77E35
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0xCC46BF0CADD253AD20669AB1EF4966CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0x531F94A0901293D9CD923CCFFE9D2415
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0xDBC8E5FAFCF5EA29D94893BA6896032D
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x7A04B2099EF5C90942E321193E3D76A9
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xC0D07F622D260514490CF9AE45153478
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x4CED307C83B4497AB6DDFA491C9079A5
it could repeat the effort.
0xEE518E7523BDF63C97B3DD8C710F1D5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xD70D142D8F81FF5E237C18EE2FFCBA32
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x1A0D7092BBF00FA919B16542E52EFCD8
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x17402ABD070FCC25A25CFB0FAE80548A
voice shouted--
0x727A57CB22CD8A7CB36C025BE51A3895

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0xEB2638416BA99EEB37F2A0A12B6DD622

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x683C5590C6ECD85F7DF80C77C463D245
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x221C0C350EF0162A183468A8C869C6DF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0x478B725075798E2E159EF3699651B332

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xDCE7795291488FBBF3A7C6529D0C7FA3
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xA16023CC513230D11A4CEC569F842480
was silence.
0x3C0C77D1F108147C1660659040E90750

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0x0B7D3A07B381CD923BEA7D4F3D4DB043
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x7AE93C0A6FC8A05CA103518986F53366
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0xEC77811C14182ACC9F537AFDE88AFD9C
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x410795A4D888591913898F0E124152FA
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x82A10B6E05FB84A250BC59BFFD9A3178
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x0BB3090DB6DA3158C6B8CDD62907E382
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x2453FB312D42FF6E02E301F7E5A33640
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x19D774EA4DE9CF7EC7B123CE1E0AF30E
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x40F09870F642315BB4A1BD14F5FE3FBE
confusion was inextricable.
0x51366EFAD8A2904056285563A6E597E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x19049FA005C9A5EF607EA0D6AC104143
in his bed."
0xFD0A02A4536B60039BC6748ECBBD0A7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xB34D653213FFD89385B206736BAFFD75
coming."
0x121FEFFB08062DCEBB07B239EF2E939A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0xD5A965CCD55A7BA2F697705D80EF8EAD
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0x40FE86CC0023920861CFAC6E05C1D6F6
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x5E6BCDE5573ECE6D700509D451A86BA8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x36E49ED7B903BEC651399D97460DEBC6
worst at once!"
0xB83876B3361BEC1279350923064DBF9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x7DC2F840752F51A64CB9C2169F18B462
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0x8F424EF067D990819AFB107D7ABF3EBC
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xFFBEABBBDD407DEF42BE977EC81B5808

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x62ADD0FD4873B98FD61C8B68883A9BAF
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x229236C03606C0E9E6D5BDA313129AC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xBFDC730787093C3B2E7B73B05E70E4FF
by an effort, he added--
0xEF932531B993EDE43B5F8D34117B0438

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x4296A2C382B1A692184F150A63898F41
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x10408AD89422E7D41578E25322BD5489
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0xFD90B16EAC50FC26FB091EF97C908AF7
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x0ED774499D713BB973F8AC5C9485B069
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x723C7B676029B8BF202BB3D8E010741C
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x5BC5F2FBBF2E22A6E57FE2C83658374C
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x7E74A5E5E84CE21A4F61086C0D09C937
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x1D1675FA69F3F7C9046F977A98FD42D4
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x125EDD92C2BCC8AF6F97085705993533

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x44E11B0D32F97060F38B3E61B893308E
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x9E6F176148522F20BA5D94F518725B4B
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x56B624E711C99143A105228316018E52
had left it.
0xB7CD1EE223760700D4A41D84CCCB570A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0xCA177B0A99DCA9CAA75512DFD4512C22
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x82809E5410B5D15D06D96CD0405818D7
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x03F0B7CA39BE9D66B1C219C46945EDE3
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x8D702120BF799B36166F59E613814589
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0xAB4369961D60A58A1C2F5F570E855AAC
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x4904B75C9291B70F677EC7326D7BBCC3
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0xF548D5E7405A6A47A7703C521BEEF78B
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0xDE6F6EF610D0DB5555815A1FAC1DCCCE
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0xD9999A2460C1C9A2B81D0B89DDF4012E
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0xBCF607EA7B74D96C72841FF9A436D422

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x31E3890985ECFDCDABA170E3E05ADF82
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x3D772B00A7BEDD7C12431111D7D54BAB
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x9DFA3D53E6D9C093DE9B5D6E086FF4B3
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x71F9CF7FA88AF56F28F35AB112655484
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0xA9C16724033E985BC4E9CD06D25478D6
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x0EA9D9BA82F36EFC464EE81637BA6CC5
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x4D472027FAEA3FA1B862E0767ED9EA6B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x925C05BF7733628817BAB8B283F85720

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0xE68FA851D25D010977C3D14E33CCE8AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And dressed?"
0x251865C874A8E2D775354C9A79914819

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x5F5443E7C42DA629D73129288297667B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0xBB302E704F8251C023FEBD9AE01DF351

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x1EAC1D6769CC94B8C7D221641A5EC341
noise."
0xF85DADE9E69589C07AA22617AE0E600B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0xA81F53550F85109852237496CCD4DBEC
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0xDA30812D5608A508FFF29E3201EF4B66
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0x7F0362EB2669362BFB32E9DB8A7A7F23
side.
0xEF411090DAFDAF1BDD3F083DEEC6395D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x566927D33BE9388E9F58A1D1D62307A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x4175B3A860B89D1CD3FA10EFC4D197CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go back and fetch both."
0x1F70CBE82054EFCAF3C6820C0E1F99EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x9F374B0E9F4EBFF5DE812E32E397F198
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x5F0E451229AE7BB25B15AF3F2CEA7957
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0xD8983ADF98A1099E40F72E90878CB1AA
he paused, and addressed me again.
0x51A6F461CA0071735267B65712CCE7A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x4839402EDF5B8052F16518DC371F3084

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x83A8AB355441AED37FDCDD3AEC5D31BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x8DC9EC5D1C2B014FDA7FB6332BC13961

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x81187842D7C8033BB7D4DDA45584B125
fit."
0xEA0292B73EEE0C234BD704588E7B3663

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0xFC67B70D411046C6275D9BFB20634ABA
the key and opened the door.
0x0FF5EDDAA3523DEAD440003A69964362

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x9D9CD99994177E04AA4D1D7B940DF469
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x2A36103436EAB118B82B7C40DF54EAA6
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x1EE8BF145F6C2FAF9834C6D2E9BA4FD4
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0xAD6856763C4D94FD2004B59445289DDF
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0xE0A8C99FFCFD9FB3062BCF48FD99D201
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x34A31718697B7903FA87A0B029C01BB1
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0xE0ED5F570DDAEB62BD950C1813230464
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x5D2F30C1F5BF4E611A04AA688E93FFCA
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xFCF6F763B37F9CE6453A77C3A63897C3
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x8ECBD30CD858B57AEE2461C0ECADAAAB
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xFF7A12B8071E7324656E5707EA5EF655

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x38BA89F863274B4A29E50B56484DA897
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x1D97F2910E401F64C13D7BBC199EC6D8
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x5B0EC3BF59EA2ACF939A5AE28E6914FE
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x802EB56F01D4D2D9EFD1CA808A635517
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0xD39C819AB1BD8958FDF6066B5343DB93
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0xF37B0040B1974E903DAC07B27F42C05D
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x85DD016C00B94E0D483BBBE5EB59617D
blood.
0x338CCD59444543A6062F95A5627639E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x1469ED82F2B9B32E0FDA73AF6AF5B8BA
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x1AB3D3C984C6C8920ABD3385231D7F83
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xD099D9E2EFF27A9268387C0A9DAE13D6
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xA436FFF6B4294AAD87639B942AB3404D
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x4B7537300E87D3115EBCF299350026D5
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xF951D0CFA54997660589B708AABB4D54
blood, trickling fast down.
0x7A34D2279AF7E76105B226EB28ADE013

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x67133D5451A4826DC22F45306438B3ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0x987BD378F9B108DFDBA45B7950D2BFCA
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x146B8E0AE5113DF4E93896189BDAC915
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xBAACB55D58EB1F1298F4DBBD8513CF39

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir?"
0x5DE75CB3DEAE9CB7BD7D4E6ED3E24C4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x9F8FCFB763B1DE02509AFA3931ADB83C
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0xE7EE66B930BE4C69E313EC522514B588
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x97635A848148E120EF93D3EB336B0DAF
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xA84FE0D9D2FDB2C85731C46B9D6F3502
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0xE0DC382DFA6553CDE3A719E87FCC3000
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x33B3AE10EE1E76FB03F455724686FFC0
consequences."
0x51828D798BA4694E191C3219E4FFD043

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x7DDB8CE249C6820891672B174238A4A6
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xD105CE5A0ED124675FE2C54D756BAD3E
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0x60431A24611DCA3BF72779B951BBBB12
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x738847C79413EF74529F19FE29419096
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x6AD435E0CC0713C723CDE9A10DAEECBE
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x3D7048654DD68E02C3E23C0776151060
step ceased to be heard.
0x47852AACD7D2D8E0069E66B344DEE34F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0xD883A705F1F763D18D9FBAC7C9F29720
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0xCEEC83BC3F8429E7AF6487C978F67FC0
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x65CFDDF5AF9D3ADEAF61AECEAEB685F0
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x1817713CE5C2FD28A3DF18C2D0CD2FA0
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0xC0C52BD0BE186EE3EF3698FC8233156E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0xEA5AB255F7282E77566728EADE1FBB8B
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x78CC223175CA0CE04553238EDC2D3107
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0x0501994D7FD5CD524ADBC52A4AA23CB9
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x0822AD1E875171A8760B7E19A2E95080
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x06D6670EE8BDC7AAC7967C53CD2E1E19
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0x135C08B45A949058AAE1FD6B1F361A2F
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x479852B75BC504AABE56665142D05F9D
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x11470A548FB8BE29F320110AE640F407
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0xE9EA7AD6CF987DA05F42E75313F123AE
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x75F6FD8FB70F5D59EB5B496A31897B6E
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x0D223A69A28751F28FA702EA98A27FB8
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x20496F89C59C25D982B29F067F60C5D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0xDEFFEC8416A73B91039050768C934F7E
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x5487E164895558ECCA2790EE83F3AB50
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x8AB8FAEA4A3F7466F49FE7AC39B85DEA
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0x0EB9197F241F1BB784EE6205F6FA275B
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x37FD4B001A50AC37FB2DFBDDF710ED79
subordinate's form.
0x4BD1C7A995936AB3CE02D07C593725AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x73B26B600DAA7BD4B67C8389CB92D92C
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x83D86144082773F394C2BFB27CA878F0
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x1E91F7CBB8CB4756DC48F7E600D5D2B5
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0x0111130F5EFD8DFF28F9C7A8B650C050
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x4433D7F7094C6DD25C44A4BC833EF51C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x5B5F5320A99B9F485B5E5648A3C515EE
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0x6390388C7B0744AD75A3AF69FBCE3811
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x2F6642E1140B351ACAD8C696F6927227
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0xA196B88B3915EF664939FA7CCD14A9FE
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x431DDC527A559EEFFCB22505D87ACABA
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xBD052F035CE026C01D83FC7B0D550B24

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0x089550631FE0A355B67DD2BC3FF7D9CD
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x71EEE0E75FD693842321A5EC0965E8C3
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x7F644C84C88BA181F4A32D3D2D7B74FC
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x031777F41FC70A0ED0B4B3DF8F22B861
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x05999E85D90170B49BA9A41A23AF2279
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0x7DFF09BA220E99B52136934DDE9577C0
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xB4FBF9E1DFA135C7C029490312824C58
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0xF59CC59A1511279870E7F8C5B4879BC2
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0xCAD50B06C86B39711F23702B34172AA3
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0x558C1A4184F1EF7EE5B3C274A4C27651
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0xD65BE28BD8C023448AABB4A1B0921264
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x492987485E6604A306B67700AD912FA5
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x521CF1DEA4B594E308E786A4BA406593
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0xCBB195FCF31BC2E3815183E9E0161D20
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x3398CDA22FF890AACD8E2504E2AE00C2
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0xD3177725C63DABE06FF131A066FC0805
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0xD65B02014275DAACE1A9DE278FD141C1
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0xD68C7F27E79A06910CC583934DD355FE
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0x901D92588FDA058F1833A1813BC48299

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0xB9D43CFF3DB4DAB8C2733C030E187908
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0xDD0276368A379FBE111EC07C0FD766DD
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0x2CCB526A2A948F9ACB47FEA3E3826F84
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xE2195C9D60FD907BDE591C7FD72B1104
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0xC95F7EAC89F7F121DC365611D4F8C51D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xA0710ADAC4DFE2E8A332E55EBF130B53
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x12B89054188559C7D199F59BA6C1176F
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x845BB8048DD99C4F4A708DA21868CA92
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0x9140F0FE852747980DA80E5B66120D22
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0xBB27CFE4D9FC00F043E610C31F9810F2
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x15CF2A02AE5125B6D4B9E07988F29BC3
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0x8CCFE9DFCE1CAE9B29335D0088BF0B1D
I might not even speak to him.
0x1CEE14949C1FE3549AE5697E87A03251

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x9578183E044D51130CE42371DCFCFFF7
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0x081B1350EA4BDB4AA9A5B0F65CE3613A
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0xDA9BBCD86D308C2DA6EC18E559D7A05A
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x6C6ECCF29443DD2388F7DDD3A10B80F6
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0xC26C1CF0570517D414FC5B3B16A63CD6
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x59FC078166A06502B8D88482B2CA8EC9
shorter.
0x47A23DECE49E8A3CD76C79D5DD297063

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0x3B8C10E97B77FBEFCCEB7E6F964A5916

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xC77CA2F7EC877F5DD4DE6386BCCFB26D
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0x496E89A3E43C55AC90CCEAC0FE406780
patient downstairs and all."
0x2DA43797D6895C47415066CFF0064372

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x9C95E0AE207FEAC7308FAD0588E7339B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x6EA2ABC0E744DE48549FB91A35412B76
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x19B0ED4CB57DAC74C1C67C2F1840D6C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0xBE32242E663818613923E38854ACBA30
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x875DCF20293D4B6FDDE9040F784C1C4B
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x8011B603AA158DA8195E6DA1321E34FC
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x083B5190D214C0D085A76A9613ACEA9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0xFC489C9E73A2BF317033BD67CC125F24

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0x2F058105E573A8D86C4362E1B42A0319

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x13302845E4D3A470298E27B7D7663722
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x94B96F289DBE58C352B707CEBE89CD93
there's no danger."
0x87AC9769151EC01FC926C39839B310CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0xF6FB3AFA4062555B19653E06AE3D245A
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xD9D491CCDD50B62165548FAF678DB620
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x1930F758E5D70A7DDE458233996E0D2B
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x4B64A6A72E0092C9E2E163906068B106
here!"
0xD2CC86609605EF2DE2532181A0B85C85

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x260BD9FED7EC86BD1377A91421AA86A8
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x763BCA9073962B0B10AEBA8E5357AC58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0xEC84E36E35576BC59F3BF2F02503B2AF
said Mr. Rochester.
0x4396149145A04620C2FCD9F99BB36A06

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x8C78C62BEF2972354045A95FA141EE55
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0x59C6E739FF1D81C825163EBAE99CC983
looked so quiet at first."
0x18855B83176DD21980064E9098E9CE8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x35FC182690113F5AC412E8FE2D9080ED
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x89A5D0E9025B74E5CF25EE7173358958
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x806898A81875A8003F19405609CF0DCC
alone."
0x4BAEB35C35E96E6E159CA81C368F1786

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I thought I could have done some good."
0x6A39B6FAC37323EF517835C7D3D1677D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x473718F09D2121E3D08853AF8C797F9F
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x817A783B1858FB3B8C0726B74DF17AC3
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x80E6C9C6EDAA64B0BDE0FC4DD5D3DBDA
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xAF0D7D66EF956CD416AABFA3B6823408

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0xA1B7A320E3EBA4196B7D24B8D20CD248
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0x5C0C93AA5320E9F4DD13F9549842CBA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x8F706DFF54279EACFB1502E0EA693980

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x61399C88731544FEF9B23148D3D5B6E4
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0xC5B1F91868ABE35C7CABD79B0A1E690C
said--
0x5DF3BA679382660319CD85B7EE8D54E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0xBEFDD19A9840B4464620D9784BB3B47D
it."
0x14E0D21096BE1722F7925D72C818E3D6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x93B846B855BBE2EA25888D36AFC26AE3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x36E55906A625B7CFFA61808DF5C47574
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xB072F0A62DCBE06F0A7D9BDBB7D814D6
think of her at all."
0xFF7D05BEC6E576F82B41A4A0086C6566

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xE97CD449B22ABB0FA23FC64C2DA5A6FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0x81643E1551720F137DAEAFB62644287C
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0xC67B5B72AE56397E99BFD9318A4BE29A
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x7D8FEE23D465D663EFB248C7D5774054
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0x00F9712C017F5EDECDEC42225AABE37A
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0xB9BEF57697560DCB9C946C6879D5AE31
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0xF23373853841F6A61A996AA23B9D3B0D
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x05B9156E59F4F4D77AC5EFF0E4050E08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x82B605C3678DCDE784C452880B03BB2C
and returned with them.
0x90957408DD534B08342BAE46F624EACB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xB491D8879CD249A8F6BDF1BA45EB0B3A
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xB009463A1E5C1D23BAB3048962A3B623

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I retired as directed.
0x20BE4866750454BF2295F03CE4276E55

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x0F1C8B52BC6037FAD29FD5F9FB4F25B6
Rochester presently.
0x2988D41FE51C96303C96732DC108B475

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir; all was very still."
0xE7B24F3E70C2BDFF708521C2B4BBDFC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x22C1615581EC28FC241F635944A72C96
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0xE5F1509E04F2D723495D7C0D7163DF71
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x116EE8959DDFD6555F055ECB3E8A3769
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0x2444D726565B41E34D2D3B5ACB1FB6F3
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x5CDA51A3B81074189DE98059C53AB939
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0x6F8A152732138E1E84A5E2CE952E24B2
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x9D28FF64359D24DD28C7F0D23E0D923F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x3F15963364FDEDD19E14261FC4E514CA
edged with fur.
0x18768C887EA198A345CD02B5C04BA07B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xB80CE3B3908FDA2F6554C00EF807B70F
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0x81EFEB93FDB490685E3DB1836B476057
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0x731A48E6440D90718FD5053F47529670
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0xAD336F5885ABF9F5E1138ABF76D691C6
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0x31AE3CE0A88145554AB1C37FCA443C8A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0xF35A67D987A7CDF53466FC5213A5B5E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x5D10D43D25DDA82AF1AC317C8F0035F8
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x57B07BAEF3D126C902CDA724EA2B4996
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x41E857AF6ABADCCCD4756F53033E4288
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xAA35CC66F5936821BEE4BED6C79BF594
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xBAB031734E5B932B9A6ABAF3ED49EE5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0xDD4D83EC0B0FDAE2E6E82D694A6C6314
the washstand.
0xF40C868DEAA2550287C9F4ECB0E77D95

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0xFB0B1D8F034C092421C82B99350A078D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0xFC0D330E629596100AB6D25C997D4A35
to Mason.
0x238FBBCA1776F93C21B4D72F74542544

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x111A3C2C1FB84035C9F237A231AEB018

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x2325705B46FC1CC3D55B81C705BAF8F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0xD26623B586CAD936A7BF7C4E12C78979

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xDE1483ED065A5DA35E2AD01BABF59907
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x2E3F8E990E06A20AE9C9328EA520F28C
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xB44C8D214A81AAB80FE52BFAF2861BD8
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x0DDD5C37660A046410BB776D22AC3C50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0xC41C9336663397D8F7327E5305A9BCB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The patient rose.
0x25A9519BCD68103F049885F0E59FB5D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0xE47CE5F06F5616268220B5903F842676
step out--that's it!"
0x72634E6B1CF20B54D38149B5F28D7E82

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0xF5E4F7C064D5D970B8CD64143778B761

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xE4D27D361B9AC0AFC1A12B6BDAA9CFD1
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0xB5216CF08461443C3F8A2A112054F69F
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x02CFF368434B0237E225FF9944A21265
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x62CAB857F6FC429087EAC5731CC17E68
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0xA43CE792EB5AD5E9401C1CDCEE28017C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0xEE3D91ACBA65E7BC850977AFF88FEE57
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0x7AC59CCC56E904369DDBD965A7CA5904
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x8E5FB760F0C542B923953C9502AA02E5
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x2B9EECBB485F8FE87B0334D2F0BD806B
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x47CB081B238655C91EC879010CAAEBC5
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0x4FBCB60A8D51E2F95B4FD7B0B0256FEB
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x51DBC9E686BF60527A91F568C74BB2AA
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x8B813166CB966E641D58970E632D7FD4
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0x2166C100EBBFDC8974860C74BFE81089
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x17BFBCBBD8673FB06C39AB301DDC00F7
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x4F10516297C8BF13A57EC8558D52E67A
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0xBCF2AB441B2DBCD9F1778A93A720408C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x7878A6FB2FE015BACD38004D982A5146
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xA57E646BD69CAD5433AD31760563ECEF
chaise; Carter followed.
0x976A1229F712546F89DD620D135CC2B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xB3962316A8174271F378A86A6BBCE532
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x02D44A747FCCC868497D2C60B3A55C71
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0xB01316ABD40206AF548E96831B022EF3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0x5E492ECE82017D7CC76ABB5EDDB55EDB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0xF1C49727975B669CFE688FD50864DC7F
Dick."
0x4E0185753E48A86FF49F02E1BC796C77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fairfax--"
0xBC87D06E1E3585EB58E302FE06F54A54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well what is it?"
0xE7764555869302BADA18EF1733AF2A0E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0xD78CC65FE06BFA5F1EE164E69244E6AE
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xB1955755FCDE3C3AACDD7F629FEA347B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0xB8EA8289C12824975D7046A480D80EAD
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x497321109DE116010060D73A2F1860A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0xAD52708A2D8539F38E0FC79455A001AF
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x661BEC10AF7E83DF87BC9C6E4A0F70EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0x2FAC74D22C25EBB0BFBEB3EF9A417C2F
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x5BBB4BC60CD1C260082E8A51D26CA421
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0x5D92D00FAD397BFC843FD6DFD4F5A20E
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x327749589398889FC98E235383ED1D43

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0x413BE326EC5F40D97338288BE9982275
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x4656291BF9D6D0137C9AEE67EF851F84

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x94CD014625A973E116BFDCC32E88F7F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0x4226D637FC9A3BE26EEFF37D80D2030D
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x60A78CCFA043596A105A5C1D17448883
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x81764151E32E7ECB6C0EE892975B84BC
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0x012C737526EC0AE4A0DDDD7D26FD8E9D
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x4FCEB06B2C4E2206765E05217CA16927
pure."
0xFDF020A316B6CBFDDFC2CAAB54FC3FF0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x5736505081B01B32B4E87DE43B3F7F69
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0xDE44646FFFD8EB79D119CB7752635FBB
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x7504CAD412A47E30BC56A82BA1971C20
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x0120275E2BDA23C7FCA6A86984188862
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x9F6545FDF31B7B086CF626D6907C7067
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x0776D82B9413291D3FB8516891366F22
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0xC0ED20B6801D1B3EE3240F70477F079A
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0xCE5DDB919046B7F4D4DD7603AF1369CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0x699611AE587974BD555BD027124518FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xA41528DF14396FE87FE17FB8C7AB3506
me.
0xA809552545BAB0B7982C5C268CE94848

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you, sir."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x11F3BA0E13EC80F76E9135625B267A8D
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly

atmosphere?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x8E976EE04482874490813682E7569707
with Mason?"
0xD2E3409FB55F152F04D7D27F3D3D9682

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0xDC019CEE979617B40B8115081DCE0208

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have

been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0x6824F9385E7967F283CFD2E3501CB3EC
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and

spue fire any day."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently

you."

how to avert the danger."

from him.

in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is

0xCAD6A5866C197B2F652C58BF7FB6B4AB
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0xAF9AED19C295FB98CDB8578D10292546
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x4C993BC3B5AEE65C2CA40358F49E7774
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x9A17ED4CA4724F5C0D8F5886531C04A2
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0xDFFFD1098BF1968261A8088E6F335E27
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0x477BF3962AC0F7B07E53D02DEA2DCBCC
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0xE16167F2D47DADA1488C4DFC923F5B0C
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x0101AE3646B9B085DFA33C41FD6A275C
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x72C98E5B04A43CF4DD3E8FAD09EFF157
me at once."
0xEFACC2B8EB64DF7E0B87ABBEF72966BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x2231F567F748DE3833A777C512F6B778
you are very safe."
0xFE7A999D169BEAA2DCD752E7BB485D00

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x33F3F0A5F8612247E8AE6A14138A786C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x0B0D833B8C3CC2E231963B5021FDB699
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xD62E9024FE5CF9F469A48FC6A2566EBA
before him.
0xC43C28371754E69E2EA3A7EE3C21A50F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x61B6D66A2BFBE0AD50F812D44AF8DD39
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x5F6D4A6053E7CF14FD492491DA28D76C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0x52DA1325328AF293895ED5599627D940

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0x6638DEAE7BEC2A941038132208890B18
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xF6B936204CA23B3E046A0D55B2EAA4AB
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x2C46D159BE9F6FD8CC40D53F34F0E5F0
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x79F5F2F5E48C2A0F875D54853F15105D
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x4CE6E7783763F24B3102C42E2792FA36
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0xF47325C1BCD157BCC8F15D990055590E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir; I am content."
0xE90CE75795CEC9AD06329C7ADBD49D86

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0x76C36389C5EC58C3BC9814056152F6C0
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0xCD22A7B297C0DC98BD61B4DFB68BFE7F
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0xB518E69492E09ABBA96844B88CC5F5DF
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x8840631D082AAF59C5512B1FEA51A1ED
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x3EB76DEBA267035717EF837EB2830BAB
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0xE3DE5461D5882E5B5C63958B26D968A9
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xDC05A333F16F991C34EC558D2F3EB8DB
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x800F977A6E7C40A09D5A666F9CD47706
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0x11733A4D11BE23F8CA41B83116B124EE
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x6A164DBE2B828B2881DF5CD0E0AAC931
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0xBB942E33853FB3D16DE70D7ADA6E5BEE
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x6A3F81DE7FBB0D230B76FA681DF91B81
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0xEA554ECE5BE269318BC1E2AA9A51EC8C
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0xC4E04C527BAFDA4B2FAF4F3FFDBB7448
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x6CA3E1892B39189BC220BC4FC92B7F02
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0xF2EB2AF53C3088A0152989C3E121A95B
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x3080568E2AE22C568E628A880063B571
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0xBBF2CEFB5BD906EACE98E394376B4B84
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x8EC83F1776D3FAE521BD1B9FAF7D05DE
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x10A4E58A7E46650410ED936B73858B1F
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0xC555FA458CBDE22F896C16BC170CBC42
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x815BCE0DCEB1FE9CE1183BAF17E0950A
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x9051CA124B9FAF67B0C88D846C9F82CA
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0xFA32591005022400529AFB6229C3CC15
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x8B9D77CADB0AF56649A1C79F6C796A0B
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x3A897810A49BCC8E8F7A4D503DCE44FD
judgment approves?"
0x998D6E95A6A26A434BB9C0850E5057E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xA6C0BD4911EAC93A0C72CA2966D14D3B
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0x4AB1F853432CDDE392AD455A11AC39DF
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x77A6BCF3127259F0BB2AC613D0C54FC4
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x2DB364ED50339632F5BC45092998E3E3
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x4007D39413578332FE0227D68C54BCDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xF33E3E74E744C15C471A91B1874FF5D9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x2029AA296930A3D9451F48F30FFA927E
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x6F543FFCC3C14B8D19D4B327801B8C53
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x4624CC85A4C48DEDE28D6C3247F7E88C
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xDC21E949AC650EEA1850EEEB9EA0DFA9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0x4A0B9072BE018BE41E4F157918492810
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0xFE2EE1EA24A0A79132E556EE257912DA
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x58462C2C188B146ACE4FE647C0B03DB4
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x21CCA4A04B3873F6049DD58B67B238DF
amend and solace to heal."
0x810DA136950D96FA2F8E842FB16233D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0xAA95DE86C7F3297080AF45CBB28575C1
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x2E7970F3A9E2807E792AF74366DE206D
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x4836FC38DAE3E8C5B4287393E63B5CDE
instrument for my cure in--"
0xBD81DE176C845AD594EC244BBDB93A7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xE15FB168BF203E72286A0A28AC6B63D8
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0x850BA129B4BDFE9FBC6722F23576F824
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x32B6007053E103242C39CBEF0B771FF9
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0xD24BAB79585147430091E169F1084F31
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0xE8A1EFDB04EDE6CB7B2008CA1092FBE4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x4323D39752109BAF3F35F9DAE6C2EE45
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xE933791DD9B26A6F5452A16EF1B4191B
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0x5CEE41B0AC10B0182F0E10344CE18123
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xCC5CFDAA50A2D324843A4CCA37718BBD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0xF0C2EC1CF9CD941E7958183DE8C81687
came back he was humming a tune.
0x4523DF3389BB33B396B52F680C84EBD6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x43661B46FD23007DBE77756752846278
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0xE261BB6C870CA5EFAC160C33A58F55A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x78C953928E27ACCA9138C8B85A77AE93

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x0A4E2A6F55E5C17296E5CE3C4B84178B
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0x1D460C67F27E5181B34DCE0389A1A8D1
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x3DD612F83F8A4252CE678F02AD2F44A7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x9C0243A1D673D77B8A2AE93B1A4924E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0xF61576FEEE5F027F440944DBE9D10B65
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0xE1854931F95E35A7C09AA083F31F6FA2
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x88597056030B0E066EB686911E8FFBE8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x46F5D7A823637CD1565B10382985F822

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x3FE8F6F11A0AA68E214F5D308E7EC544
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x861612EF5A25764A3B069B0741C81D91
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0x6E902C54294E7FFD97A797AB5162C130

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0xDF24DAC629A2DB118D6C000EA5795F13
cheerfully--
0xC813026DA1B17DF8451E79524F45AF4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0x03831DD098E17A8C80E2B4A60102F1A9
I rose at four to see him off."
0x680A08E272609186F21B9ED61B4C2110

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

CHAPTER XXI
0x971F053796E09B705FF08BB7FBFEA386

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x997FCF787CCC33AAD12E252409D95D6D
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x84B372BC9C071F51B227BB9B52C661A3
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0xFB6BE478DC2C7F935F33F64FDA0A2DE7
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x90497284DB80F790A12C2D2F41F77334
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x527F1887591AD95BECA0ED00F5A07A40
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x2175988DF056B4B8B46B94332B6EC23D
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0xC5C53E2B8EE806D5E3DC0C3627F0ACC3
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x1ABFC02B91C8AC5612689066E15DDD29
man.
0xFB679D9CE9B5F0AE5FAB709DFEF67F3E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xF37ED61A6F447FE5BF88D49AA2E7988D
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0xEF6A5730CA05710F1D5654F1B5C31EB6
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0xE4145E728C79B9A1F9124A39A9215732
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x48C35FE7EA07D13D659093CD4EF5C790
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x3251ECFFD29FBAD45D18C4D9FB695BA1
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x00D807383015FBBF247C87FD1DC0BC95
little sister.
0xAE9AF6117FAD61FE75C281BE1D4F00C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xEDC4201122D6E90F391334FEA1A17D87
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0x40ECFD3FDC97B6FAEB36E9B91B882165
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x8AFA9100BD378274FA0DB2315BE7D778
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0x54E2E02E175D3165B3693FD3968CBE59
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0xFE9157FAE78829E525384C0BAEA4E719
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x51BEB871DBA803B432D462FDC660011B
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x59CB762FAB7EB9DD95327239D2BC8AD3
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x977EA4871D4B27C5D740AAD7B973285D
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x096ED272C054A0129C810D557E417861

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0xD3909CF06369660FF1E278EAEA3BFD6D
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x8ACD67B2F8082FFD748F1B63E4AF0E97
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0xD0ECBBABEF05EFF1AB8544D093AC7B6D
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0xA02E2FDAD0432F03340911EE8B0AA166
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0xD8462A0543DAEDD43296CB5E03F7D951
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xEFA263DD5986DF084D07AB3CF869297B
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xCAC84B81626D354D72B64D40627D864D
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0xCD01CF71F95980A7646DB30C6A805558
was surrounded with a crape band.
0xBFD03AB380D8E8FFCA16039A707021E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0xA63F5F21C1E8CE09DA5929DD83F9BBED
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x844984C4CBF95BC7935F73ADC91B2832
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x5FE526D38EA00D18F03FBCEA8CBFE0D6
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x05E0A3E5EAFBED6BFFBCF3730034DA05
are married to Bessie?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0x56CFF451540B3EF55E0DCF5401BF3FD8
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x05B3EE12CEE49226F058414DBAB4A1CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

badly at present--in great trouble."
0xE8A4249B457C1B976FCD2CCB737A1FD1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0xCBC15D9E86C8D0C7C2EBAD68F4946F83
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x05DD02BDF998DB9C73C4A925268B9875

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0xF64888AE780E31BE7AAD8A06A0AA1E90
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x794978C1E7E9F14A69494A1D2269DDA4
his death was shocking."
0x526593EBA2324FE87173B5F58EF84245

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x0F10912538ABA084EA56EBFEE3DB7738

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0x88E63CF52308CD23F4CE4F63452AFD83
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x789046E1D861E5EEE96122B5C0A5F70D
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x1F6241ED60ABF74D2E400C98C675A4C0
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0xE9B06131297B6454CDB6902F39F5D72A
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0x3B57C4A0822543DA478CE8BC9AA1C851
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x6FF590F291C3481A4A4D8470F5314F93
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x38EB8B170D151670F0260922249071F5
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x38921F5E914435CDB714C6F95F99EF81
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x9F719BC0F0B174B8A6799CF8C362A559

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0x9CDC201F38754463A55FB6B23081A8C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x00150E7D4D89E803590B550F3AFEDE01
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x11FD2BC40A75D33E213409011E0CF0BC
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0xBAAE44C1934E6BA3DCC22119147F0462
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x512E962BFB9FB96A2C5E85B24B54400C
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x61AA827E892A405CAA60D7F17F0A9E1B
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x90FD74D8D006387A8204F5300F37EDDB
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0xBE75F52DB6850FBAAEEBF5E92058CE97
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0xB20ABB16A7FD0294A576584957E71E1F
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x4906ACC0BFA0A5495687BD5EA0A1F070
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x6DEB589B2430934969B51FE4B7CAB2B7
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x4F19100A863C06C8B126EFD87C1B405D
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0xD8FC56B504653A3FE35BD4BC9B7793D8
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0x75891C3C8061EE3BA73CF39D5D35CC32
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xF1D7DDC3E836ED47BF8BC32B5B8DCFE9
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0xC96B03C31FCB119A310F56E714F90DF5
morning."
0x8050B12C914B5BF2900E02AC2C867332

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xA9085FC4A013FB96BAD86A95461D9BD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x3FCD33407304E7FF996F4039CFC386AB
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x14DD0A806AFEBC76F6522636BE927B89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x6F8967EF27D43DC13B161E090365F52C
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0xE0B6079AE99C4C73798F109EFC03034C
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xB61BDBC4E2148C5B1D7534965AECF7B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0xFE6C66EE4FD663D3A73BC525FDE125DA
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0xB1799345D2AE17139E9CAD114854EFC9
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x0132593CAE32E348D6A228C122ED80E8
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0xD0D3B69B4819E92195050FBB391371F0
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0xF3A5F183361EB8C95E614E046D2C9978
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0xC73C7A8E1C4E6B1D511FCC896D91719D
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0x1B81F70A29FC56E0F54A6587A77CF6F8
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0xA2194A8CA6D4A89F444EBDC1BEADA675
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0x4ACBCBE79BB4649E4317C1BEF50E1F1D
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x9D6CC7FE7A9478E505FE6A5B58D2EED2
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xF73D83EE4EA53BAC4ACECF3EBC39A1A8
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0x44FAA2C3A2836F25B8ECA15997BD6E41
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xBD66B865C8E74142A6FC2BE2A17A630C
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0x2989357585965975E776B6112EDC1A80
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0x9681ADB562CE836175F9ED5A0947326D
lineaments.
0x673C6217E88B5D584AA5C87970100838

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0x84EA38D6127599A3A201B5937195B9CD
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x75343DC08237FEE81D81056BCD5227BB
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xB36D4F0F94DDE08644AE39E88819A29E
cue and followed me from the room.
0x37A5CBAD1A214425677F0FA09AF0C650

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0x47A600830A854EF408C1E6C79E40A27C
which he had shut.
0xED92E648D8CE0E1CEE8DF7563B7C47C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

"At Gateshead; in ---shire."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

people to see her that distance?"
0x68A94013BC77D3E49F369D8F539A51C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0xEFFBEAADB34BA2855D97F0D91C3C5A86
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
0x910F97E94FDEFAA4D91A145258751E75

family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked

0x46BC29FA12D38957F963256CD06BFD1F
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"

said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but

something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for

myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0x9C850874BCD453F90E8E2054227E3C27
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0x9122A44B68DDD14CAC75B9A1973AB604
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0xE7093889B4CF99B45C671081D0BF949D
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x0DB4CC8F26B889B6C8509941308B5DDD
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x7C2F37248F696E709638014E657BE051
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xF27400D92BCAFAE1C81BE572DC729BAE
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xAEA1078D71F220F0C1EA29CD59274E7D
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0x1187C5F8E4AC0E9F2E6B36ABE5FA4F99

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0xEB72BC3C811ED9244C800820CBAF0392

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0x994F9DAE7375BE4674575E606A815CCB
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x2F7EA3D78B1835454682EB62993DB4E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0xA67BC2C69095BF5DEBB8D26DC54BD98E
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x5A51DE0C47237D5B942D272C3F2480C5
will finally recover."
0x34822B22C9BDE079E125CE5D80CD12E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0xA9B39F47F0BFAC701810C479BFE75CA6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x764615392BBA8B89A432AF56E3FF5562
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0xCCBE2B4F2193688F65AF728B71136B78
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0x926157909EDBE6FED0830D345BB8EFC3
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0xB487FC563FC800DAD9225C53479E071A
and then I will go up with you?"
0x872BFFDCB02AF9B294D5B3F34AEA8E7D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x22966575653AA11393A97525AB99A922
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0xA9248AA3C75AA31FFE44CC781A31CC26
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x8E5AA95B8C6B44DEDB59FDC13F58E8B2
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x227DE3159A4020EFC90F35E30C22A60D
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x4140BC56F438D6022DDE500F0F2797F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x94DB03526D2E7E4DBF55C31AEDC8DE35
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0xB2479951E69F9F43AE473FABF978EA44
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0xB49270856C10BAD3ED3C97B531B09D61
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x0FB5E63AD6FCA42511B6E2D5263843CF
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xFC1CAA0E816B5AA80BA9421B0F4F4E6E
looks.
0x0FCE1856A98D8860953F6C0A0C42DB4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x28CB8AB796B6FE2338B348A4D5118E39
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x9B7C49E012144FEE9B58F6B0FA8FCCDD
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0x407D44D692BC967CE7EE9474A71D1B4A
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0x69FF2F80D2DA9F7795FE90B19DAB5722
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x89B150C7E9D14126F88B950904BF6406
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0xD44557FAF1CD8BFDCE03D13BB5D0E14F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0x4914AD56C44DF605260D20574A2BC2D3
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0xD12D66DE5FBBC5BD7416AE2FED94CFB3
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x4D0AF2E16ED6D317FEA1991458C431EA
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x80115493CCEB77D7A56BE80437C06CEE
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x42DCFF690C1E182B6F13DC5037E873C9
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x49CB09F581AAD8FD6E490E855C55CAA4
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0xC0841A0B61B9B579BE76F1E026C018C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x311D8A76ED3797DC0BE8CC433F1EF397
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x7D1FE6D597342A40D71F9DEC6F3A7B85
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x1D518E0F6C22BD1EC78E9BE54B3CB146
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0xCF2C98D414A62664F899A089497D427A
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0xD36E940A610F6831278D8DC25C2CD951
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x3E5E7EECA75E770A037EA0231AE43D16
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0x2098C4F1B3B3AB9AB5DF1EF5113494AC
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x71C703DBF0EED7B864F3F159A7215266
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x6D47C919779B5737A772005B57A97E65
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x5350DB552512BCC1E4E6F38F9275BD3E
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0x3280279732121F240EDEEF548BFEF115
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x321698BE47E092E2C2CF086F50CBC2D2
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0x3164F0307940A04404B0BB350C62CC71

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0x6482316C1DA4357F218A94CCC0897905
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0x141F2496BEA32051A949C034EEF10368
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0x6B316DCBF9678194D124B35C5559C935
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x29253FF5763751A83FB6B43FFF590BD3
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x932D37F3B7D6C28482C8F9D48E3F8E41
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x71B3AF57EEE2CEEABBF5C67E63EA89D0
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x0F120402870A4045EC17C169F59200BB
past recognition.
0xA00560716066832ABB844183B6116E5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0x79C42FE3786DB6E2B8CC50B2830C756B
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x2B9791C08D50F8D948CF66E568545BF7
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xE1F6AF7CB2A237D6DED955181FB8D1DF
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x8A6FB32361C8C79B2925ACBDD888468C
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xCE4A14C5380DB2750A726C47E080F9CA
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0xAF8B3217E1EBBD3FE8DBB09B05FCA887
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0xC6B44A195DD934BE878B34EDC58D8863
colourless visage.
0xED9006A13A58D0A042132BB29CC47EEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x0AD24FBEF57921013369191D028946DA
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0xFD68C21D1FE7CE9C8E461B2998BFBD17
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x5AE1503FD9087383B6E51C39DC4CF249
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0xD553551BEA9FEC7E62236DD5592837B8
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x98BAE6A08F02E4F08C1E86959CC6DF58
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0xB5A241FD08B06E207B253B7A0B410E7C
other's looked puritanical.
0xB2D0B08C20FFF1415C7B1A98B3317B5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0x54D47A9960D6159A103460083135986A
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0x18D668543CD30A9A4DE8490DA41EA044
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0x81BBC09D32DB8B0CEA689084353D4A30
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0xE45DA9D82FBCFCAE88636375B5256E2A
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x8A16CB969440C851E72B95E460C233BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x18BDB9C3E48F903F061DE7A25523E5A7
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x5C22DE22394EFD80B04BC7005BC1CF0E
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x6A5D82E64BAB0835E4B0D5828F276E72
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0x8F25DA9C02BBC2902AA0A7A27A5A2F73
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x7C0582DCB04319FCEE46B3867F97B4F1
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x1C719FADD97E42FD0C48440063B9682E
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0x494FDEE032D2AF9886929BEAD1C9512A
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0xA8A142FCA4EBF9CE8A42E748C6EB3FC3
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xFE353085C85AAF8C628D561C2456C263
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x1F868DBCC8B4DF1F17FB9975DBC54177
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0xBEE12EF6E80D38456B68D91B57B97249
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xA54AE6621C6D084EA5581F805A5F78C2
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0xFC7F7472A2A8BAF1A8984F2DC0A3E26A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x585D08842E22A6C16284A061E759AEE8
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x023562D1A16D969D1A6FF7F543CCC818
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0xF8FBFE570DDF8F27EB164F09348A0367
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0xB9495BC0B0F4685AE9EC55BA3B1F87E7
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0xF14C03274A81D873DA85C1BED3698DAE
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0xCCE15D72D7A6A72F146951B19E85CB57
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x3A976DAC332E79D57433F9621EA6889C
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x54AA546FA2A01B206E62595166332487
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x0C3B4715205D07CC5651AF9D946C1456

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0x5218395E51B8004E30D57B644BF14365
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x7FFD347FE00A080ABE20C4B1A906BFE5
liberty.
0xF7CDCC7CC51D047660B03D4E220FB485

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0xBBE31AFD94F1E072D541F32C4649A2D9
can see her to-night."
0xBD891A78D08F53513B283C6D4D227DC5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x859A2B26163CD9B56DDD5539E11439ED
should be much obliged to you."
0xA0A94758BC2F55ADB0FC0FCD375F99E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x43DED7A544170C7142A72536844C8096
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x4102B256A5B949B1CCFA963DD31A9092
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0xBC91BE02E27B6D3F1BA26B8C141CBA21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xC15CD60F883CC107158D9DB48A2FCD1A
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x27F397E1149F84ECBB7C0625369F2C13
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x92B01A761304E8D4CAEA6CA7EA2579ED
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x2E81914F28472718D2CD3DFDFDD09A46
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x1EFBE6382CA05077ED4B2FEB10958950
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0x96EF0B4CE255881A802CB89F6ED91577
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0xBE4E2927DCA6D1E8581AC831DA07B025
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0xAEFFDD24B821E80408FEB59EDFD3503E
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x54FD1F14ECDF33450C5963894E03925A
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x816BB6DE4C0AF66C9092EDBD8BF26208
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x4ECA33A50D1A55C372F55279FE1D1A23
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x40EBEE12A284C2C5E5770AB806AAFBC8
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0xD49D4B721F296694E19D91C5DB8CEE19
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x1909C21359CF1532387B377637972A04
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x1084A5AE654E64C7165B1DB99B84D0BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0x73FFEEBAF3A565F4012E7009A6DFA692
us see if she will know you."
0xC38BAF8C41EF02527D2F4C02D7DC7EEA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xF6506163C84D85A036788675CC59FDD8
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x66203345BBACF0473655AD90EAA325DF
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x307045C091732452AFAEDB0E7BBFE41D
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x7E2B74721438F6B21E1BD17C52ACD22F
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x9BB7F53B5CE4E332925DF23EE6A83104
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0xB60CE8D462D16E484B81D2F30318DBD4
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x3F44D46E34AA456A12445582E03056AC
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x7ADC4274A66D04D537F440D8CA6F17AF
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x7298A1883E5D6C80596133831EF6968D
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0xD8AF6E00EDB2D93427E79DED0350B059
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xF94A9E94AE25EF9363FC0BF7FACAAF42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x895E7A61CF057BE6CE53496B7816574D
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x52BDF2408FA64A8A40DC54028A778990
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0x27352C66F52536CC829EC0FD4970C5B1
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0xF05F05008AE231AEAAB219B1F2FBD67A
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x03C2A0D09A47602579639654D36603D5
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xCF6E8E1BE815EAA7AA654F86918A4307
amity.
0x97F215D286C096C199880D700D212B2F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x1D6400BE59E5DF6FC41A1CF21C867069
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x5A1BBB9C891CDCB45B27B57AD83FCE96
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x79A04E9A66086FD8B8961C2AA8D57396
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x2C5F447E8D53BAA0269DB9B0B2446E13
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x59413C3C9C82D87C4C897F837A080451
she looked at me.
0xBC0B7D123CA5FE96903096B609C1EB47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x1B2D74F91B6C22351B3896F7ECAD8711

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xA93A9FD5CE79A33D0732B373D6A1FE53

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0xC1556894AA1DF1998C4210DB9711042E
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xCF70F543258EC228FB54178ADB06D11E
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x0607C7F3E389829CFBF44F4771EAC0BF
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0x9C1A0EDD4276E5118E07B0375A228BF7
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0xEF479CB2CFF46DBEF9B06CB586FC0743
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0xAAB5582F3ED7DC5FA1C1E793166F544C
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x025CC511140D7B2878872514676A6ED5
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x0A64270D83BB313F8D8D3734000B31CB
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x9CB59A9FC900A341C9194328DFC53C1A
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xF87E590AE50D32B59A9F8C4399CCCD6B
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0xA77AF5C6B218286E0F893035B40ACB4E
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xB584FEB1FE00DE5A0CBE4B11CA8824F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xAA5091978EE165873C41D1A3CC4BC154
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0xD6E7874DDB0AD569BA26F7E6691974AA
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0xE7BDB902AEDF5B203E54896651DB5539
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0xA63610EEF9FA0432E7A3A2DA24593AD4
the pillow.
0x4982CE877FDB88DDB3784F50FCF32AEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xB9A86C299E76B71CC123020CD06EFD11
till I see how you get on."
0x2F58C1497B0492D5B45C35EC1F3CF956

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x46AD8DD916AAE430E01582EEC9860F8E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0x1DEC359CCB1A1497409C3C55FD610638
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0xB640741DC0741908BE6E5C74312DB435
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x6802FF4E27F6BB63B4469CC26A69439A
say--let me see--"
0x59ACA5E4F452426AD8CFA6A8D702A647

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x188E445C697F22243D64BE243D661AD3
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x615200E3942C35EFE6270F161AA70911
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x578A834C7F41CCABDA4707D1E3CD9A78
was at once irritated.
0x1CE99202A6954CD7933F689733C2DCE1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0xA4ECE41DDFB92C9241ACAA96D2E4AA8A
you Jane Eyre?"
0xE4508F9649888847D5FEDCF4892F107C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x9310459500DA74B7C7AC1EE258413CB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x02C9D134369DCF7F160570CDF3D9E5C0
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x5010DCE83AB5D2BB2C83E9D998566643
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0xF4D92D16A6EA011D5DCDCAC56ED60D25
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xC7D493C541AE58CD320FDD7B41A543BA
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0x9D98EC012A39F1AB0C7C4EBBC97CDF0F
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0xECA91A2796AE7D83BB7FF42256EAA033
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0xA425EBC57F9C69BD656E87E59695CB5D
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0xFDBD34D7AA2DE601BBAE1181EC7ADE81
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0xE62FE753007613DE538447764429A932

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0xE09BA62E19438ED80034909EFC184A8E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x7A3A3BC80E5D8D8D77A47FABB31F56D9
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0xF46994CF4DAF53C765BCE6A56915DC6B
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x349CE331AE84D6DED1C86663CE977C99
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0x05017D4735D15BAD329FCC275F265C43
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0xBEFD5B5F601BCFFCE62F6AAB6BD36E52
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x71A70489FAA4D157E993725C55798B53
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x03BBAC99695BFBF681ED9E1CFDD673D4
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x86F8E52510A0E7A1B03FF4ACF566D69E
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0xE6AF0FA7FADC6EBCEF9AA022D664FD20
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0x6E82504BD9DD05E9F05403DE88CAC3C7
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x3DE13556BE3411FE576B188170628461
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0xFB49CA36D971C3BC9E5F4C201D424A5D
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0x450D146310C54D0F5D7107EA5B395C87
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x4E3D830DAB4CEBDA5726C72D86CA7D65
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x4C071F837F801AF849E4017FDB010464
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xE48D208987E5F98FCD9CF53B49E6592B
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xCC8392338F243C75B9B81984A20C0C60
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0x4785B217DD9BD9431EF31A21D56526B0
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xF0F22672575E7F8D5AD5093D889FA253
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x49BA85275888829E4FD5A045DB9A8039
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x26DEF72E96C7E2B0B208CB11045237BA
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x949BDC799D556C55DE90459513062B1C
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0x97149BECA3DE42DAB1A08BB905423F2A
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0xE55C850185B797294C897FBE97F8960F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x6622F02CFB21D312ED509704833F0D2F
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x97DB7C7BDF4376A7AC6B541332286D3E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x3F71ABCDA18688C12125DA9298F352F1
the morning she is calmer."
0x9BFCFEF9D5FA8172CB4343749DE76326

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0x2E999FAFFC65131A9AB695A9CBBAB1AD
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0xA7B8E1A0F52BE67A0E1C0F51B65CD9B1
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0x91017FD0FCA103DE6F41CEC7CF2AB68B
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x6B3695F3D14AC05D170C0ABD940FB49D
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0x76034C3CD202840DFBDA56FDEBF36B20
had?"
0xB012EB8C329AEA135FF90E8B5AEC1BFC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x23B72E07480BF9309C9FEDAE4A0BE9DA
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x11CAD1F5C926FCF977858E30023608A7
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x1BD651045DF9369772D50C3A7A597DAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0x02B5FA7B5623F20213F19B08739EF96C
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0x80AB44E4D13C3A27724B9442F81733A6
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x4A495F1D525E7DFF301C2C5EE26903DA
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x8D8CD5D4BF26BE7A3E648094B26A1B9A
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xABD352923258F46E674514CC4C810C8A
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0x4A6F79B99C333895F611685B47CDF683
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0x61BFB7DD1D82BD01E5728B5CD7418013
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0xD6F00499FCF995269FF608B5D0194303
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xAC9D64B098CC775DE1CBB3258AD655DD
for both.
0x900D0A6569BC9970BC24E17517FA1917

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x5EFBDCDBE3F43F9CE4DAEC099F3A01D5
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x9B399BC5AEF1AB3D128AC54322BEA2B2
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0xD85B061B5826E8EB43A3510F4835032C
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0xAC26CEB0EA8C7EA49E96BA4E7084F7AF
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xC97130EB3092AF20719EBD5F997B04DF
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0xA1BD01BD8327D6BEC5BFC8556FC2E5FD
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0xC1CC1AA55747C19E55E8FC9CE4F01A17
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0x9EBA21B15A18E58F9DB06B424C45DC72

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0xD35BF6FEE46A97F2A557B2939CDD3035
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x585CE547EFEA38B6672E759D0110154D
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x0640703F8B327A31DECB8CB55CAF5DF8
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0xA1850F1B3C8D4CE576D3A3C4FA7D03E3
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x23E327EACC585AE58EED8676DD69ED4A
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x89E02E48066BDF9B4791BB5EDA6AD64A
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x7742DAD22387BE44C162E679456BF8FB
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x435BF54428E2C33F9DD4D0DA950F6EE3
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xB1D05CE877A6DAF89EA241B28DE01C85
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x0D85B78F0F9CFC8AC8BA8F9C8A571C75
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x56D46976C903F315841D4118191956C7
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xDCD571B7AA38BEC179B84A4342009D4C
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xD4861BB038674D91A07D37F17C5D487E
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x8EA3EAC52C50B23F573A7702F9EF75BD
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0xC13A4EC4FBE53C19091DBFE4E59C8EF5
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0x8C46ACA96E8F4AD188B3B7759E3D8307
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0xD7008436A433E63B42DF058E91B47795
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x53920296018A865A93C7C35ECAD9AB39
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x7F028B0F75F18EBFF516EDD6D74E6186
and content.
0x11D705436A6C8EC7B2FFC7E93DD4E780

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x4653333D9CC4DB0E61999C65F2684635
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0x114C071B8460F189BECEBA2E37820AAD
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0xE218036534D19D23484877979E230520
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0xBC1AED6451DC577F0C8C97B58BAD9EA1
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0xC4CC0AEC6B1489574F91D27B2B58C72D
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x07821C7A92352018D9178CEDCEF5DDC9
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0xD2DA9ED7EDC56AAE1DF2E87B3C099D21
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xA8CE0B7E5B7D95AF4F58DD3BA00D9F13
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x640934A7105D497AF08EB31EF187BA85
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x83609C96C806486C89E21333E35AD35B
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0xE0C93B71497F4765BA7CD5B2C818C1CA
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0xA6D81BFB9C4E6A9F3F04222A0C14C119
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xF04E02F30930C88F3F860978E520FA95
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x3947787F60D39DC66A593D565CC49701
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x6AA6EB5057DE27120296397225EB89EB
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x507FB88C122BC7248DBA15629C0DAC22
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0xCE3E2CECB6F16DF7E69CAD4B28C58995
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xCE056F0735D16D363A30C528CBC0852F
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x935538758112207FAECB7A6E83560FB6
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x72D1F228FC167C6370E40BB0D71AA212
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x6BCE2009E75F8A26C6D4A5F779BB2697
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x666BC8CCFC936152A219E5EFA2F9B895
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xD722762D598D688B44B86C28C5B6FF2C
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x0A6A8A959B222C5E9E1752340E31FEFA
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x5F99E9A43522A943C163D6C5467B3C41

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0xE340500AE00C3B886D65FA9BF076FD5C
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x7F5BDEDD11D2B8215076BF34E2C2E83A
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0x1EBF41033AF021F30BF52C020ADC28CA
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x7FABE571DFE7E16FB6E614BD5D3D7168
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0x616CCA50235B378F67458B63ABC32763
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x53099D6A292F057A8CEE8CE151C5C245
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x4DF3D8913FB8CE03A19BB62BBB1C4030
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0x4F1436CFFC45D316966CBAAE71A95A50
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x533A374E19C69418A8E91328545B4F13
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x8CBA9A8630D31FFE17F0AB4197BF72A0
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xF9E2BE54C4F56DF4D7DD8BFDF5A34BFF
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x81F2AF78693765D55B42BDFEB2278AD3
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x87616E753FF4A1F5DDBAEE381CEC68D4
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0x86B3D78B3B66EDFF0C36975AD90B6824
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0xCCF296CF2F50C868C1DD9E09060CC4AF
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0xDE4244CFB38DBAC361F4EC73A66A0FD1
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x60F2969BC434EF3E4E38EFA1B6503373
vary its clockwork regularity.
0xAA76C48C0DC2BBA175509D9C53E0306B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x5D175EAF61AE1FC52E246C7D7C963796
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x3CBF8C517130D1F99C442B8E72C0B426
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x48E89A53D206ACE98DAE12C7E47FD4BE
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x4A2749C15F16C38D264A939196444781
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x50924CD04392242550623207CC9FD567
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x456E68B696D4B762BEC423F6030B8308
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x2DEFA7CC954C981E3E9DFCC7ACCF8B4E
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x95C702BA7E60755A32FCC31FC02B027A
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x41AEDCE0F4C03381A36E39EF90124DAD
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0x8AD2D1D94C6D46A0AA845C75EE2E77E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x8E94EBECFAC6DE8876F9C78B82B00B61
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xCBB98FF6D3CDAF41D29E0A8B907E017C
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0x46543B41BACBBB582638BCA92215978D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x61E152EEA9A0BF1B3B64AC5FDB0FC3FF
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xA075A17FD5D858316E149791770F6D9E
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x523E6ABB0EDCC93E357D4FDA42835DAB
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x724036D460143B0E2DFBDB5955F677EF
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x214A6215DAF8ADC671EA5A1A85D9CD00
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0x4236A07CBF47DFCA585244BE525127BE
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x6CCA3BDEDC19C9FADDA47BC20EF32CEF
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0xE4F209896CEE6A1865C023EFD6077A32
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xCF661E252BD8788A5DB00DB02F4E047E
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x6BA3ACD47BFE79EA3424F10D0F9AAEA4
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0xD3C0CBA701A5A08A96E9969B9B4E4535

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0xED9D0EBA42C987164F16ED6DCECB8C6A
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x7EB9DF01DDDAEFD0BE341697719DF8CE
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0xD8C774ABF42BA9C6A20EF279F5D4AB89
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x319823B79AA45D62018924401422BF29
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x958405494BF7382A1995C09566F906E8
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0xCA532F2DFE7349DB6FB8D510205EFED5
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x0819AEFA1E3989C24FE6C6B1DFA26856
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x76F6ADFD49DCBF2E3C3E0660F6982342
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0xA55EC51E8F1835AC51FFABF4E8A6648B
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x442EE8E03428977AD8D360C7D05D14B4
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xD802A6B038A6E44B06E2B18992A9EFEE
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x9DA5747425BF6FD554405AA00F19B0AA
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x70FDFB723B8F4E912144638015BB6455
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x0C416E5B18CDBB3E483BEE92171123D6
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0xF3AC5E8996E1D75FC40A73FCA0C6A901
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x2BFE7AAC3FC5BDE02FFADDDD3BA1D2E6
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0xEB6442DFED3171AFFAAD8A676A20858A
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x1770E9C5FA71FA7E8445A621ABB3B9DD
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x952C80E107DBAFDDA51F8A52DC54214C
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0xF9BBF852769D221626F7FD7364F30E7E
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xFC56CC8BBA5ACD4A419C5EF3E703FC5C
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x7125523BB1CE746B19B63071904EEEE1
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x3BDE875C21040D4F833A602FC9AA3181
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x3ABB61F19F414FB876B352DD3BC3FBAD
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x167D60FA97EC931190D8F6581977E9B7
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xD84FE67BAFA32A047D3C9A2DDC1106A7
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x467BB2147DBA4A423B404177FFFB12F5
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x09632D97D13CFC792372A896437C10A8
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xADFD580803096D42ED75A7C4150FA9F1
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0x088A5965D02DC3B41429EB06EFFA78EE
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xDDF5C342E9334380AE7E1219E1CB352C
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x256BB5F2BC3C20E6C8CF89E732908055

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She closed her lips.
0xB2E76201A703F768054D3F694EACBD45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0xF7AD5692E2341B260363D9F86E189060
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0xE4CE6B16168C049E144747B2AF5771A6
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0xC1334A1680C118D39E2D53FB4FFB6F7B
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0xB47BDB820BBF283087AEA24F187A48F3
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0xC9CC38BF71EB1A6831D60B222201AB4C
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0xAFAFF11EA8DB563547CF2705D898D192
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x6CE52BE6FA660C3C8419923D1D871840
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0xB695D20157F7126ECB5197AA01877931
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xF88FB1976CB2F5447592B3DDD9BBD77E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x8035A3CD4D20B18AE88DAD39D67628C4
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x079595CFE63AB38172AADE8646A3F75B
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xFC47AF90ACE6A7746EDDB7FDE6ECD803
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x0B7CA94CB6D934D7029F15CE49B21620
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x1D23DFAAC688A3FD0202C8B90D06E70E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x7D47BBCA3340816054EDCB5B1210FE36
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x4B9BE6B1E82459463ABBD41798174119
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0x0E4960AE615CA447A83F17FFECD8D122
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x782776B357788FF620754D0A510A953F
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x364C822383A8E7E9E0D40D68594DB494
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0xD5AC40C032B186EF91A3579D3F97BBE8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0xD6429C975B6F6C452E7AFC864FD7538A
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xE456311E46FE2A8C72C503B261EC5AD4
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x770C31CB371218C196B10453C3844140
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x4D580AAB3F816A7A10FFD68EA42A8364
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x88F5D0B730BAFBFD1F97526950ACE921
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x5CE1C8E28E0965B8317F069F3B599DFA
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x7FC4F93259688009F235A00EFDF6699E
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x51C4461588C0220BEE552DD479E267BD
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x354A21823D95512ABAA9DF03563D1D45
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0xC2CC9F9009653C5FB789787A3F64C796

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0xFBD9006595002EC1624842B644AB96C8
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x64EB9BB357B89E8CC0F1F5C219156010
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0x6243DC5A8AB1F7616128AB09D12DF2FD
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0xDBFE2FBAF6EF1E2EB9808CAC9F265640

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0x9CD986F4FEE769ED249428141C961F6D
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0x349DBEA787B9F99474980DC122AF66E2
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0xA25D4C6824975550756A22F809E18B5F
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0xAC8A0D273EA9104D62145A70B3FE1EED
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x3604AD45DB153C355DA8A4323E858121
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0xF0FE5FDE6C7548937B3EAF37601B59B1
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0xCC0532475D4959B7875692E01577D520

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x628E6AEC0610B15E591E4C8CBF419DC0
her.
0x911424E81D32FB72F483D174084DC672

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0xB12046F0F661FC5B5E1A0F46C2CCB0E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x3B7D2303CD9759B6DD02101AE2C0EAC7
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x3E10C3F65B227C93ACB9FF32DACE6D5D
me--where is Bessie?"
0xE1278ECF990B61B8C41F79502623CC0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0xCF3FFC0C98106B378B15768554B6AAF0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0x24C6FC3D61EECCE238156F1C713F0F5D
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x12BA75D02FD6BC57C30A762A44B0048E
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x85FF689502C993CDC2D50D9B8E868F9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xEFE05D0D0C0AA6EA51E2276F55D57FB2
identity.
0x49075C3793A63263A210C8C7BD4D2B37

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x214B1F3CDD6E039EB509266E5B4409BF
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0xD6D478C4A5F2E64A4C1C79B09C5130E6
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0xC52C416903AB6E887A852196C7AA61A3
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0xA4C523D957FD0C7A528F60937707BBF9
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x891421AE2DBDED5CB26BDD2802BCD8B6
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xAF44D1A4DFDFA9B8169CF85F9E007B1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x663FA4EB634718F01D32F1C8593C138B
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0x104E45B5FE6CF0E64D186D2EB2C1B0FC
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x2116709024DF91F223189728D5599326
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x43B767184362D317298C4678DD593802
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x84CB59DE7B15B7B51D635E7B63DA4382

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I assured her we were alone.
0x315D39667DBFEEE9B5BDAA2A6FA5AD2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0x9EEF2CAA8C0622A781FADB8B4DDD421E
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0xE08DA18F91E076FB12B3D86D7879A2CF
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x91BE30AA8812FC3BCB4CAA2FE14D6E7F
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0xAA29F94FC1A55F8AF80DA8168A199043
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x3E93E430FC9B7A38B339ABCBF53DC7CE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0x2E5305C616CC2E7DD18E49E21D5DA078
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x38276A5051959878EE419A9BA76239B1
of the last pang.
0xD75F5541EF4E94DC5E785D8B71AB93E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x684F7F19DED3886C670AF8E1C833AFF4
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x231223E1C1E18FC84EC66B5F2F7116EF
there."
0x28EA96FE59261C4F30CE642DCB060528

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0x9D535BAB5BF512F74E26A5BA7FA933E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was short, and thus conceived:--

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0x8BAB64535D423477C920B7440F06B204
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0xD8804A04C1D58AAFABE769982040947B
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xDD5089112049022128EC97E4E555CAE1
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x53D1D43C4FA1366848977BE063770515
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x34C7607D7EDEE2B1B9E46112C0616595
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,

   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was dated three years back.
0x1264DE05C003F6503C8960973EDE1DA7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x6C35572CBBD25A5435D476E240329E1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x81146EBC2FACC738DDF7A62837C1A8BF
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0xFBBAF7C4FD43F335BA1A6F86C0DB551D
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0xED07DAA9263B5F1DFC2CECA0F2447289
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x494F1D7DC490E150BA34CD34CCC8BD4F
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x9CB3B506902328437036465973B66B93
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0xEB837AED08BEA2F8E9678D5B63CDDFA1
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x6ECA38F2E890445212AECF7073DE405F
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x67F309ABBFD7A05434D2C08F7D78582A
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0xF1847A99345EE86B3BC5C3801FE2EAA2
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xC3533FCAA8D25F2393409F5F5FB8D6C4
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x5066507C58DFAD4745FB5C830093ABA9
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x8850A87EFBAE3EF60E002F8B2CBFF288
passed since that day."
0x7ABCEBFB09AC7CA116C2C34879D1E360

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xE5944AB93F6F3DFB0F36BF38A6784DB3
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x5A905CDA4B8A36D9EB6C4A714D65CD47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be

adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0xCAE08DECA11F9732C762EA66C65D2CF0
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0xC050113B8D399841B0C74871A2C651DF
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at

0x61AD713BD5B3A150005B51A4D798C650
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xB5BF27439B477618654571BCE6039EA5
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x84C7B9BCFD2C2D26DD5D315B8E68B169
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x1C277CC90E676954019C92BCA3811AE4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0xC69FFB5ACAE3F39FD8B434A1AE577850
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x202E61176428BB8B920270F8F66E1340
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xBE750D06A3803AA07136276F71A95FA3
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x9D436FA7F1C893FCFE181DBDEB55BCAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x0C8E7E62FCD34BAF1BE1925C811C3E0D
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0xA8E81E5B07F60AF4936162C9A8F015F5
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0xF3F8BCCC4A18ADDF4069F3ED98C33964
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0x2165620D914ADEF5606AB34B6BC200AD
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x38C3771CC288B8C9844DF3A8D32AC62E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x57F46F6A49BD5261DA052B62CA5FA634
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0xBBD20C1E60D74EEF37FA5B62E6808D0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x22C7A586943382CBC2BAE367F5DACF0C
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x98C6B54E44A47F681A72E3A345E0A617
she must hate me still.
0x704EEAD7E0C4EA0B25CD61FF21864ED7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0x3E192A597E65CF94BCA42EB62B745FB5
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xA3255A3E5A9D25010FF7591BE1D79A0C
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0x569FDAC86B34DA4EC57D1C01E44012E7
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0xCB96A291CAE1B2AEB4F90F3BBAF8D6F0
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xD430364E61FE54D8DB81A818CB6EBCF0
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0xDA3A1E8E581132E248D82254AB9810EC
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0x0DB140662164D4638DBFAB2911074275
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0x412097589C598AFADFAFA335FE8C4634
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0xFADCD582BDEAB3A6C5CE4EB03117471B
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0xA13EDA36ECE1EC4FEEB3027E96380729
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0x767606E337CFA186C1523AA8831F7762
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0xBDE2F96F0387DE9A62CFC362F9187179
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0xC5C06D3CF6EC4B33AC60F5E5BC69F8AF
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x05B5A48EF4E6CF61DCF4611D17C801AB
form.
0x59AF7349AF60C65BC2F1A6AEAD22D711

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x6009C5644878C2374FCB14F595EA8338
observed--
0xB535EE909C1260D2B37FE837EEC742DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x3C8FA999714BE3D0E024FC67AB09BD87
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0xCDFA58E29FB535A71F7EA5D687708A08
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x38F0EC2E46F5610D93BD68298EEBA6B1
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0x4083EC8DDCE6F2DEA88CC373A551C095

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x43B8318246C76AF50974E062155C2C79
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x16FA3BD8EA6CA980682E219426FE41DA
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x6AB4DD1F57049B1D9D81F66427733FE2
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0xA0187B5EBDE6C73A5784F5ADB216165B
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x731D0684BA7DBD71CFFD007D1BD2E2DE
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x51940F949A39C17F39DF759EFED30036
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x9603A414BDCF80277D00D9792A0EAECF
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x1F1D149F8340B2F85533E70D913BD307
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0x47A04829C997179A01A154062A1FFE0A
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x44A34B28BD3CB9F3716124C92AA40F7D
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0xFB2E5D0108F5DF40BD8B64E7B6F81698
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x950E9BD5B4518AC6C0B28147FF0ABEBF
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x9E66217BC3D849A92FFC8A7EDAC52CAF
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0xD8AB4D64992DC48856532607097AACF4
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x7714C1ACF2A83D62A84CA2CD5924BD84
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x7971E358BE79DC28A6C3AEA5B8EF7499
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xAECBBB2413F7D0A23FCEB92B8EBDF074
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0xBD50BFDBF0604FB6DFDD66B3184FFC82
patient and compliant on my part."
0x9E19DB0710D2ED210552F960C9578739

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x1129F8B3B5583F9180972AC65AA311DC
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x6AFE0322C17A1955F1A20AE55B899260
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xF459985330F10E8BD63E9F62C2D4EE54
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x8AA5BF5B2D4CE45ECBCD99EFA31BA34D
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x7E828B24AF6126C51716B732D838A0A2
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x204DA5A1A47EC51FA629EF0D27989590
notes of condolence.
0x76C88AC78FFBFB5157D84FE8990D948C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0x5F55C6B5BCE26F8321874B51FFE3993B
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x3C17844020F726C38FB44D28F61FC0B6
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xD667279CA019D228A88D583ECB289A96
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xB231818317620B3C0C205407539C1BFA
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x700F508447CE25D4DEAD6094624F94D4
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x17EAE57E7ABD2D9B4F805851B5BF50DB
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x86BAEE58D0F00CF69E3E837620A7FC38
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x1FBD19DD7B0F9C876DC8132BC4929631
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0xD5A8488DAF7DB1A6EFFC8A6CEA654382
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0x83C4C1538D11AF56F3D24DAEAC7154C0
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x0D13491B45642C48B945248662C0C4F6
veil."
0x77D256F5A812AD152EF9D4EF026B350B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x6D063AA88CBACD32B6E7934637631966
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x0A832AB20C4B44D924053713235DF52C
good may it do you!"
0x51A5678BA20AAF4920C43551B9F4B99A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x0414900C94BC158E93AC5918A82B247E
you have some sense."
0x0DAF899808A9E3370F6ABE3B23DEF245

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x4BFA278FA310A896D49C0C012831BC2D
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0xC3E309409CD0EC6C246EFA989A052F79
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xA09DFA4CDE24846882EC3F4E283F10F2
much care."
0xFC4354D00F04962D09BB5A9ED3AAC086

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x83E1F15677E5908480490AAE04372A7F
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0xCC3D7F0D1DC0C57D7B9E1B331460410E
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0x30A3145A8247571102AA832FA4912450
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x48966E6922D5699AF324E15B7E4AB072
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x01BE7F21F9EFEF491E8C59939D1079F3
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x76FDC6D08B11D12915329D7B6D6C45EE
fortune.
0x2A22119690ECFFA3ECC95334D410EF03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0xF2A7C4E24C3EE9DF22FEA92ED4F7465A
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x6EEEB7E049A0102DD81A9AE0B454E52A
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x6E9EAF36E630B5F77E190170264181D9
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0xC4929AD21FB058FD57F6E90616BC507C
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0x31EA5CC6D8074926A131F0F25645CA28
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xA97309E6B727B1FC36E0AF7FE49CF74C
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x86D09A4680C449772352B977AAF23ADC
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x5F65FEE64B6D748EE0FE5F9ED030CCFA
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0xDD5193CD7BAC5DEB507F8291A64D8671

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x6703EE39CE2A95D6C22E990DF7B32D32
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x726EFA3697F4359357D7DB72F509D0C5
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0xB574CF1B9CDC966F0F5EED112BE5D7A1
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xEF9598F60B9EDFD57245CB1BF0847253
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x772CE96C974DEE2FD8EB6BA78C5EA164
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0xF33B5CC85896411DFA3EE890AC4F37C3
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0x441CEDF9370DACB460CAE27324725AC4
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x9EFEDEB1B19678AD85E3633F96C56F11
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x00A17B853EBBA7E8DA7D1D9272B6864D
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x7C13E0517C4ECF7BC1BA86F15E207CB5
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xC297161797AEE5315E4B8715177F8EEB
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0xAEF75F628382D1C8D676A14093528590

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xF6E928A9240F87E35B1378137A2FF69F
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x063F98E0F6CA7DB3AAAFDE2ADF0A3EB3
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0x038F0846761D7E39AD6B037EB9918C13
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x7F1AB52449F39D88A4E5192D1929ACD7
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x2800BDD7303760236B2AA6744C8C0B3F
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x3A48A7DF1FD002A57A054AA79DEE5C45
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xBD4D4B7B6211BCB6688A0895F643E460
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0xDFA14555C6EB4B12F0DF13509C966B76
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x94DD287F306F4018B481CB632AECC30A
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0xC4CD6F996AE8B852A1CDD59914A855BB
don't doubt it."
0x672A8FA5435C2DC6611CDA909EFD8F88

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x94C57C66472D3FF11E0727357F7E5A97
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0x4C372EF3052A8116E90831C7E3952A0F
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0xDAF218A39E8EF34AC268A656CA142111
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xC82AA23C7E447A449E22FCB34F3020D2
both her and me.
0x1F8A1D21B30EB3E6212D4D0582BAF0E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0x050D8CC66F02AF693085AE9FFF70DA07
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x2B585460ADDF77E3F0FEA7BB40DFEA02
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0xC9718BB2A4CE85AA1994553591B04623
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xB9FBE352229DB84BA3E6E2CAB496289C
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0xCF5A4D7E8CE31A7BB4EADA27806A97E2
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x8B73CC77BA69FC80BE9108CE39625F0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xB344E1CF9EF5C352AE74F9C2E99F84E9
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0xA1C37069887836DDA5C5EEB923174897
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0xB478850E1D9C4E98A018EEBF3A576953
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x3E9FBB197164FA3E1366DD6A6588F189
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x1EE01C6F1FBC9177F561AF323DF6FF89
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0xECFD901D02330CEBC45AB4C007035E51
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xC006F10E48345A86F6AFC0B92DD6B0F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0x3E2A0F3B5E45ABD2943C59FCCD08B1FF
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x30B87698E192C6A6A92F5CE23F9F69D8
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x7A0A38F4EB42C0BCB315EF62FF87191D
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xC39BDBB88947B23FABDBCDEEDD3A4219
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0x8BCCCD4C5F6CD93345FA4F48E8147ACA
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0xECD1E8E2DAF96C36379B743AB2B8686B
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0xD34423570AA0C74EFE8ED5D5A327F243

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x6D5AC94C9E984D0F516E1A28BBB75B57
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x4D112107E4D6DBE0EE8A28BD4363C03B
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0x1D48210C0E6469BEF6886F37B4F642D1
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x6796F087F4F888953E4D6D833943F9BA
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0x84B120C93CB2D925559ECEB648BC6FB0
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0xC48444513737A2F37C4DD52571F2BFE6
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xA47372146439D4C93EB50E6D1C562BD6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x378821C5AED71F250BC70A054FA61FD7
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0xF102BF4124F409CCA9882C65773DD27E
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0xFB94C14F59E97E330C19F4D2EF742EFB
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x5FC34943247FDDBDF05B69821B3A2A08
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x85CB03CE821124395187EB849CEB835E
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0x5E1152E0AB5E8BDF97438B10CA0B7407
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0xFD374059C188DF41572CF43E80CE6BEF
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x167A0E04C8F612546F63DF3DEE569045

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0xE92E2363B60A1C1CC13E5ED4BBA99873
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x766C004C60553E6370F50D75478600CA
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x8E08F69EA60A1445405C4953FDD921AE
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x77B46C0249230CFE9A23234C3C1B1DAB
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0x1D5BABC1471280EBC84E104A4A2AA8FF
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0xFB38E8C598C8AAEF6CFA9838CCEDFA2C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0xCA84CE6291A934E622FD12C060F45989
are!  Come on, if you please."
0x1F67398A71F3ADBFB14045562B8A53C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0xF125E31C24721CFB0F4A81F59AAF3760
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0xFD60CDFE36105638ECD17DB9E50E1F43
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xD60B5559397EFE2C1E172556B64D6782
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0xDD9B9E839003BE319553837FB25BE10C
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x935BC013A3396914F1E367A52230CD47
behave with decent composure.
0xEE6BF812FC0952BCC99FAAD82B868E61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0xC2A63EFFA4157BFEA4DCF71E9B66F159
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x32382322059D0CA489AE33281904EA07
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0xA8B8BC5CDB90B9A262A855DDFDC8FA50
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0x4AC784AB48300775D3A1386227DF6E02
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0xC242A683C4C525467DF8EF0228D07181
month?"
0xA7CACAA8B93AA14CC59AC63ADDE6BAC5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x94DCB170FE7618B180D87EA32B9A1CA8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0xE5DFA16A4A19BB0F47E4EE9C57D62691
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x2F1AE245A7A11F10B713C0477D2AB7B8
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0xF87188CE1286F6C6B75472F92A47B2A5
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0x428A5E9843B9DA6BD3E3A97C9EBBA4AF
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x02B3DA75ED7705DDAAA38994D299B245
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0xE332558B1F0E0F573E6CB2EDF47DB47D
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x4F2DC3DB9A7F2B8C3A39943148C72D30

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x90BB614EF57A222136FBC6A24BF98920
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x4F12EF1D92509109D29BF4F6CE534F08
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0xC1B01D3643205A68EF6BFA39CB49989C
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0xFBF962F6F7640C53597B7B619409746C
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0x2D5EC81A441335C7E74CEBC0D6D4C4B6
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0xAA74A6F902027D6D21DE36275CC7BB47
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0x14A54562447EECA7F0CC1501A20D38F0
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x03F15B039675792AB3ED33DDC0675EE4
that it were my home!
0xA2718F9B0F9E04E7462EBD0C4C6F4C0B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x37DF9D9C0B8B75A9DCCF95DB8B9E4C65
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0x4BB2347150879482AC09FEBF8996097B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0xA7966EA9C5A114D092835D9DE19A53FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x75C3A20A51268C8008C422028C6E05A7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xD53381F6ADDB72D92BEDAB18C111B8A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0xD3128279A5AE96CE4C393CB6EE6E48AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0xC86B1A9CCF4696317331E2C9ADEC0C69
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x7355667AFCC01CF24F7B1A904ED69F45
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0x0174C1F3544DA8CB966532FA4A846664
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0xC4F7AABE09B9EBB756B5D2DD93FB2883
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x68C463F54E286A447B284D88661F6244
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x11D40A1CFE56E06E07289F474D96C7EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x96B7251550E78176D3A6545C4A47973D
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x20A972FC15D1193D8FB3F2B48990DDB5
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x82B9DFF8C5D716E7667C5AF21D695D48

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x1820F68B0E589AED35BEC000CCE36B30
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0xC16136D1100A05BF13F8A86289E7AC65
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0xD3F0CFB54D99B3550DE3AFBAF29776F0
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0xC8F35FFC618A5A2E572C0A123DB622E6
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xAFB0CE90B398B84CAAB320E3772AAF2A
shed it over me now.
0x1D4849DC4E4EE98FEE070BD7CB25974D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x1EFB0387FCB0E808227FD41804561DC6
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x507BEAA5589E522D695FF2F183A6918E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x742B2F1CBC254774420C5193D5E268A8
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0xEADB0117C49EB819A454B375E6344766
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x306362B31DA4D882FA3A073B9722F435
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0x411210D6D951D40BFDE0AC978BD3A78B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x21370097B24CA75F710738D20FF49517
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xD6E99180A157C26D25F12CF41CB9DA63

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0xB20BA6E1B1FBE71A00EB1B1E0E230707
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0x90DB6ECC1C82D2E60274A3B81F5887E9
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0xD146BE3F3984883994FEA245315BEB34
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x06714572188F3716FC6CA88F98F332E2
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xE2451736E13092CC0C1F4F66A55B849E
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x90517C5A3335B7C0C72F9C584550715C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0x9EF8B26AE6BFC5775336C4F759A0A671
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x61A7FD990FA91687ECFFCBFE16AD6FEE
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x1A0C68E19BD7F5881F994685103DF6CD
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0x2B2172E43A9D47F9300BEF71293F6416
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x4EE7F399E91B2020FD9CB21ECBDED87F
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x68FDB1822A0BE90ED7A637FA628CD97A
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0xCFB8B06201D7CA89FE87C792FC3F3E12
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0xA2D7D29CCB6D9E8EB811A3BC2734A9E9
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x51926F36DB03C405DBB3614861D7B70C
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0xA0C0F4774F990A5600CC5BF02DEC1393
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x44178BABA8E9670B3DAC920D59E22816
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0xBA3F587A46ABFD3CACFCD759776BAAB1
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x39B33ACD1DBEEEF82200C51803847694
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0xAE6F03331A7B80879B3611341E7FA27C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0x493DD49490AB3A376A6D6786ADDA573E
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0xE510BA16C0987216D25F861D2FE52CE1
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xA3CC0DD8338BB86022DF0BB88E398B1F
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x61B91CFA1659EA5077E67BDA72B2D012
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0xD2260E175D7E119F39DA48C57313E642
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x6AB30FB725B509D407E9007E5F250C2D
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xF3A84949B3700D3270D5A039075B65EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x925B62343B5E4F3A23D9D5B9C4533011
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0xD1387B8D14A74FDD5B2921E1ED9C1F03
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0x67F48ED3337605D748AEC2C1A6DC6414
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x3181E14A16C0BD6C6BD92448BD77C838
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x332EE576BF5B289950AB3D4BEA2BF842
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x7F4E59BF928987D87B35C54CF2AAF797
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x8CAAFFB04689390B5F9E3F0CEA92A4A1
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x218A03DC5F18D8ED05554033EFCB6BB2
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x6A1E28EDAC8FE1EAD1F89EFDD801D00E
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x564363790CD61F7EA93D68824E9D9AD4
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0x86163CB97EA6689A4B9857CA30CCCDA2
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0x9404414AE6A9D92C07D5412522C4648B
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0xA7009C88B83CC1B7AD899B3DF7EE0B90
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0xEDF4E64CBDDB75665D4AE72ACB6E7C0E
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x4DC6EBB2CC356DD4357203AC05096C73
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x2F0A0F69820F12F0E530551F0B91AD0B
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x053E43A5B6BD82CBF8869FBFC4AF23BC
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x0769DABAF8B9F6A4DDB9122D135DC4AA
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x988F969C5E65D51DCCA2F958FE7B6748
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x4677E01F5F79C8DB83217F8F3B7EB248
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xCAB707C8DDA1DC1FF367BC322876D764
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x0F747AC15F7655DEC940708B9A9F2C6D
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0xCFF7001BA9D35CF7C42FC35F6796BB3B
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x6907E4037432637F8211723C28EEE0A9
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x05B6BDC12902CD0230C993B75EBCDAD5
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xE285CC35412269347992CA7C7118ACCB
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x34223457EFCA7B49D961356F6E0151DA
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0x77FF0CD6E8DE5F630BE628FCA71769A5
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0xFF175FAC911BCA562FB04B69AF6EB297

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x463674E4AA6D1C32E408270053187B58
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0xA00142B1BB90ECDEA59FE8DB73E44B72
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x32194A6C4C43EDDA6DD34BCC51C559F0
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0xCE23C9662C20E932EA2AE5898E299ADA
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0xAA9CC02660549366C22CE69E29E786E2
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0xD31463C54694AAB76106FBCF547A699F
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0xDBD74D325CA28721B866F95A53C1FD3B
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0xB34078F7CA8A9E1AC61C8FFFE35B8411
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0x98D9B5E6238BB46AAFFFF71D85034B09
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x388787E3A9B4D2191323964DF2F47580
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x54E1D087361B260D925B37925CAD5F03
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0xE809AD3A093E9CF4F3B5F83D34B97529
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0x30B52D0816DF418E5436DDAA2EA011AF
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x8F6B39006EEBEF3ADED3185901970431
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x81D4906BD65577ECD2F49C9258B6743F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x867D8CB54154C6E0409B12B75BF4F161
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x419FEBDEB0ADA6B983CEE1462CE80EF2
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x1E623D4E1B65BAFB1A2C37929DB4A02D
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x12D35FCDF6298088CB73C88A5D2CE5D9
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x47BA4368AA08351EC7FB9393EB486C1B
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0x51849A1DD074F022F9D199218BBB6148
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x21CE17FFC4924E86B314DB82CEA5BE8D
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x9BC2FECFF92584E527AE680781D6E35B
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0xCE27198D1FC9D6D69AF6C4EDBD7DB601

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x7D7C22A6EEA2E13DC1E0A14B5D2644BF
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xAC23FE8E123D64DCD8EC4BA4F055996C
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x66312812E62539E678F8F239E2895F6A
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xBBEE605ED4DBB02665DA865EB7C6E762
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0x76A60CB9130481EAAF92933CEA3E5358
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x4070EFBCBE12704A1C0A087B6DD230A4
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xD91D9493423BD5F07EE3C255E0B8764A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x27FFC880601FF7502AC74BCFA84AE0F5
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0xCE37DBAC5F6EE880F14AB2CDAC597AA6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0xFC1B62400562C79EB9A33FFEB83679CB
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xC17F59890AC54213F48DF58893579D3D
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x9B7F366F9C0865174B38D13E5B5382D5
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xE7618E59B15625D0BBD1CE82F14B8EF3
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x520A111C7F9BD347569A7B0B0A371E52
turning--
0x625CB111056EB38232372BA1154400DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x1AC871E2FE69BDCE86F84B6A887F026F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x7322EFBC723F13411DEE579A783211B4
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x236D10EA500123CEBC50777243543916

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0xA8D819A3EA48062F71E0FEC88284B9ED
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0x54A2E7FE017C1B931621118C2FFEF7DD
there! he is flown."
0x1CC2EF49F943E5015FB8576090167A0E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x9EFE5BE56207848DE10A5C3BC0B8063C
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0xCB0C67CA1B00BA198451B6CE45B1E47C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x47BFF75DB267D0D0EF0E0F24FEE0B90E
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0xFC28B36AF4D36D5F708870300B48C159
moonrise."
0xB07216E268C028BB79296F6139B07F6E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xE92FB0A7A10F4CD83EC8AEFC799C5304
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0xA3CED0002AC5485F7130537B80EC2458
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0xBC3CD331EC60AEC6816F6544EE9A44F6
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x8DEB667889112BAB282FAB9A91C5CC49
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0x2F3E0E1FF6D2D312A78A952342188767
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x4585EDB00D5F2C6A64E0E5FE8EA47C20
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x638FF4175CEE951E8B47ACB6267FCF38
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x3A8065F19B210CC6E8A04DE52660C5CD
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0xDC2427B90CE21CA6F71B9261CF72E5AB
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x62758DDA4B2514EF06C54F749C2AEF7B
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x004F8A11A1C49F778445DCBE03EF823B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0xAD9D606E0E11181F88EFE5EB9C640C88
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x358416A7556AC7AA72C3DDF43DF840BF
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x447B8F9D581CB010DCF454C2F3AE87C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0xDF843DE6F73794BE7FE4921AE5F1B3FD
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0x9D70F1CD8ED8DE5FEA9D06B0198324E3
Adhesiveness?"
0x3F0D3810BEE3384947AB516C322A46A7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am attached to it, indeed."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
0x92E3A4607D3AD0F468378428468E416C
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0xED5ED50CC38FE2AB6ED6596FC239A881
simple dame Fairfax?"
0xFB1E172A47E48A50E3FAB9EAE36B301E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0x80A0A8D9079FB157C3827E6B61BC7A66
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0xF1F6F5C7AE0914D6769945120430D1EB
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x785F2DA1F1A27BE2E7B912A0AE80564C
on, for the hour of repose is expired."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
0xFE7F0328609D26FB340E21066B2613B7
must."
0x1EDF8EF511862F2B9E1906D2D5481C2D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail

straight on the head."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x3E955F75A28EE4253911A380312F4875
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xB9E68B968798A34C05872BFBD05FAE06
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0xC42CB0B3BE7EB87D44C430BC5B057054
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x9031E81D2B3868F76F2BDFC381C3686C
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x0BF4999B4BBD361C78D96805867B6789
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0xFF65B481C5C91BEFC9379E0959EB5EF2
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0xACD588BE4F5F7EDC5B67662EBD0EFF03
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x970C7B421DC555358024C4FBBF0B24BD
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0xEC9678EEE7EF7DD1E01613B9B6823D19
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0xE070FA63910267E6F145AC2EC3545773
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xD25A691C8BD6FD6256BDF18281A8A391
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x8A65EC2498CFE7C0CC2DBF926EA072A9
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x3DA1212EBC6AAEAB5786FA35DD0EDD00
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0x5D5F1829DC9752D40451C278E7A9F643
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x60C36B37C816A594730BB222949A6ABB
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0xFD6009730DE4993F065BFF603D35358B
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x08548C42EC40492F0D86F39E5D821006

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0x34BFF0D8324B4B91A9E716DC3655D903
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x8F80C67D2C07435EAF50293EBE4FF261
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x6678975F09A70217F4A1E098B2220254
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0x8F9BBD49B0D114E7D37FAD3D864A768D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xA8F73ADD77C12609FAF733410CB620EA
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum

for you."

"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her

duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x011789C31FA0C2E08BB3E8237797748B
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x04C3B3C52A5F92A6BC5752C947EEBAD4
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x6AF05C5699DAD95C2C8890122A20A227
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0xB98B4F39E4561B3A762BB5FF445FF7CE
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll

like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."

distance."

0x5A3F1375458AEAC283BEAC3EF01911BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"From _you_, sir."
0xA7634F24AC3EBA74C0D1C8B54B1C9AD3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x927540D1F88D578A1E6C0AEDA63E2630
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xC962F4247019496A289049B543F6B950
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x1B3FACD1FD5623FEDA87D2EBC75F4200
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x57FAF776B100912C9D5B0A59486C36ED
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x6A53994C374BF4E13006C0D5951E9A34
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xF776F67A925DBF1F3167550CAE3DEFD1
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0x4FE12EDB03408A9490522479FBE148FD
loved.
0xBEC10673667BB9F7D33BB05CBAB3EC66

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xD9C2B76E4D552C6BB8CA11C78B7FAA6A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0xB0618E9C18F7824CBEB25E348FDCA3B1
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x53780579C9359D55B189B8ABCBB651AD
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x11D25F614DDB6931512A9AB20F211842
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x6F3DDA29DF5AE7C8801F74A61AC871E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
0x7660CFE3A4239184FF00CCC9364C8834
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0x9C354B2D2909E12FA8F82E127FB7524E
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x3B36E8CB2D4DDBED4022BAF644218B17
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0xFFDF9B117F612B3EC3F5E5C1F7443348
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0xDC150B2CAD514BB8BFEFDE36F28D93DA
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0xC3D29574BCD6BD8AF4447DE3482167B5
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x1E8D8571D5BBF846185914B7D4C41AEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x31EB9C29361774754B4115BB7F3E3F7D
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0xCC5506551790EF603A4838DED3060445
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x445B344164F298D54FA63E59B867DCC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x51AEF9859DF0959FAF15234E1C1D3159

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x48C14FE392295E241E7630116F4AD192
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0xA89CEE5242D6BC6590FABAD1E4608552
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xAC7DA16CDFA0D9DB7CFCF86703A99787
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0xDBF277B0D0025A52B54F724CC84C828C
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x243DBE3798BC74446E2F25006611CFFE
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x0845510E23804BE3FD2CE966A9803468
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x1E644F99D68243625F8CF6E28DDB76B4
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0xD88CCE33F4DCB72F0B87AD15D390BA87

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x7106680D789207B34339C772FAB24A1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x69FB527F6C0B3E90214024A871E67E77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x83080C74F99D840AD51EDD7D2AE20DF6
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0xE7BFBDA2ED0A9F3C3D54D312A4611539
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0x435A0DAD7A06B0E4492F215E24E95E04
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0x550C63625945B7AFF76B79EFC462701A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
0xE446D268FB303A5B410DCA32F22AD2E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x148467FF8847EF3688A51AD4A4C266BC
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0xFFE0CD98439E5E70A8A7824720E11F22
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0xD2C2F44EC6DDF9977D23769AF56C083B
speak.
0x4D764B824CC1FA783DCED8DAEDC19756

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0xB3F16C7DFCB9B29E83622DD9917A6CB4
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x645ACC14E31D14118ED5A138C013045A
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0xD9DC2C2AA5F78C7854DFCFA3DD81A20E
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x8D706FCEFB082EAD0F01A2ED12A81CF8
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0x2320B1EAF64BF203A124AB8968B44646
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0xC3B3D75A7B07C64E134655E52A8F9986
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0xE6E35796E501D38823B5BE230D86E865
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0x1A55E4B5E7AF63DB3A08CFFC6A4A9873
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xDEC33B412C7D989AF6B6C499A12CE5A0
on the necessity of death."
0x6F3EAF91C261E8AAADF50D8307AE4221

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
0x290B65CBBD4FEA5D307777B0EACA1DB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
0x809D9CB313966E8B7B7113C025E21B08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In what shape?"
0x90E21A1FCA2578D8C788F3ABF88BB47B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x7793D34D277538921347ED09B26B3569

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
0xE26EA4668E5FE290CF3C0F9792EF79AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you will have."
0x100761DF8AD3BD25984261DF265AC8E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
0xB7929C24D948C93777D09F868341DC61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x89D97A7FB6A6CC6CD6C2F39E5796E6C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0x645AC50D0751FCB00D4BADEB540D210C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x11F76FD600647056DBAAFC9A01344532
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xF396F90E06995E5226A0AE88C36950B7
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x9C7EAE82FCE612BE16667E22D1579AD6
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0xA6E2A3FD0A4EBC432181CB6CE772A8F0
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x260E237864A497CA5F979F1BB01CEB94
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0xEE73800ED144F3CA4D7BC51D7E11651B
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x2310A2ACB350BC0EA73444DAEC84FB4D
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xFAF12A65BD536853DC00FBB3D90324BB
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0x81EC321EA64EBA8961E5507507B32896
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0x10B63EEBDBDC009A2BB6EEACC2D0168C
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x386037A0FD47D2BCE8137A0B1CB997FB
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x638D0ED5052029C716C2F0837721EE8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0xC4FF1BB9A2E178C67265F824E420EAEF
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0xBB191407C5CC73575D240F359B4698A0
Jane!"
0x1F265AC64EE90794F6F6933B11BFF8F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0xD47329E44D0FEB6DBF9EACEC32C7E494
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xD2ED583423DFFF385E2E95EB6E7429D2
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0xF0D2B47E79D1E4E37671D63068EA36BE
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x3E9AAE9273487FCB246A25F8E255B833
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x390A2B2CFEF9A7751442CBD71100B66F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0xA7C88271A1ACB32DAFD41C30D1F59430

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0xF6B4C73A81EA483E6ED0E9E8ACABACE0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x7D100A32F931231A83FFCB740003184A
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0x659458571B52154A262007BBC04A30D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0xC0BD55F3C55FDE4701CD0BD40582AAB4
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0x834912FAE1F68E378EA3E9491A778CC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0xB8FCDA4B148FF0793E000AF5EEC9DA08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x8A7202DC0B3785D502A27361620C35F6
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xEAFC8EEDC76BFB3E49678CDEB42DC283

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0x587D8FC12FA34C4420476BD606FEADA8
best earthly companion."
0xC524C1EBCF0DF1935DEAA1A8961D79B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0x9AFCD6D50CF149EE49366F776844C742

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0x7157A775CB01E1AC2A06AC6247B5176B
too."
0x73A6380C3F5C12C2B4C549866C59C529

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0x1D782881CE0E913C4FEEC8E9FEB9C14F
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x0CEA3D2E02B36285F42CBEDC9F6922D9
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0xFBB5CF0B8A7CDEBE709E726F7E673E98
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0xB1DFE05F3C52B4A5801C2392AF939A53
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0xCC62DDC9FF4F6A8AF2E22C48A50EA941
said--
0x5DF3BA679382660319CD85B7EE8D54E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xF92D64575C1D7D990EE1D94BBF3FDCE1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x76DB4F4257E65551B5C102FBD092CED4
return."
0x02D13649DBE60B2546836A681503506E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x4BEB5DE13F4D0F9E23D5F53A4E0F46C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0xEC3D8B947A9E8033ABAD8A7C7CBA3FCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xEFD913525A3BE6BAACF185F756B8D193

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your bride stands between us."
0xF432A4BB6FC89B565EF3BA2281BB050D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x29DE501F4C8DDBA93CE94D32C87577AF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x7EB95E2A664A4532CB5ABE0214DD84E9
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x9B76734E13743511FF12EC3D87F0ED64

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0xE1A850B1C0B2665972A27BB34C7CC409
was still incredulous.
0xD396EF521BEB073222895FD583F98A09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Entirely."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have no faith in me?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not a whit."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xF7B3CB93D9E0790BF52650795A909C69
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x90391B4DDD8463E235456B5CBD17BC61
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0x338CC7C126571E216C9506EE862DAEAF
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0xBD109C07C83AAC04816BEF4075419241
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0xDD60837C7E97CF312AE670E417370D86
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0xF04F13D195C1BBA546F1C912E88C6020
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xA49A79A3A82F08E5DF5C2F60663891D2
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x181E2C6AD6CAA1118E86E2A061FB6CD8
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0xE3121412EE041B6BD5C5C0E35B38CA1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0xF928E09A4F4D6B886F0C201672037086
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x0312E2A1F8A91DCD3E36AC645DADA6A9
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x9E4C7D6122FFF33A7768D41BFE2F295E
given me?"
0x8D6179BDF20238944E95B2B0E29146F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x19527D7BB7E755C05831BE7F19DFECF5
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x0E6F66C9F975FF712C4A758E602F4C1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x10A382F91687B485C2EB19AAF29CBD0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why?"
0x1A7509121D2A3E91F1A46D4D531250F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0x8B7F4239AC4A60819502271BF9DA3E28

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0xB6C6FE45539615380A4399A19CA00D22
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0xD2B5B4A6B559CDCD6340756CB5AD4D13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x57E7600A65D78CD483F0F9A9542D924B
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x33D7E5AC8D393C4A2C8612AE60AB008E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x528CB7B0AC0F29B0C89E1F09E8F371CA
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xAB39836B62E42104A74FB2FE91F31726

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x669A1CE3262CB33990D518B6CE74F6E9
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x8FED16E7C551DCC228FEC54364521F22

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xE78011D7F98FBEEB7AE154F7C99B68DD
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0xED116E37EEEF431F172687C6B87E3C62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x8CFBD47967E8D6A1384B43AE7AC72006
be your wife?"
0xD03FE1525E47110EEF1CB4D923DEC360

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0x87F0B47CBC60C6AD0CBCFB8DF3AE00A6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xDE5373ADF7124160FCAA0940071F71AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Edward--my little wife!"
0x012E313631D7CACC0E4C353BA841ABB7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Dear Edward!"
0xCDF5EAC07BE60EF9619117BFF0E65CF9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0xA6CA83A3098E24D1FAA58243143EE343
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x8FF66832F4EC8114FF6A2B18AF9CB426
happiness--I will make yours."
0x472035BD105B0362F0576BAEF1067239

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x7C09B7A4CD22533E2D3C95D78F756EB6
have her, and will hold her."
0x7E21ABFE08F3BBDCBA3C9A259A07B98B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x15E466414B59FD09CFD9A6C2CEB498D9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0x091000209E3372D33AC50B3C565AB867
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0xC54BC445366DA30D76D0188810D57B55
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x492B76DA714B976620D72754251662DD
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0xCA9E00811BAD87FB7240A522874A4F65
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0xEF78FD3EFA169A454C4E456D7E713D6B
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x8C46ACD51D2B3EB359907C9F21348BFE
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xB664D07F1A25F2EBA927D2DFF9D10CA8
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0xDD9C3CD6B4465920BD2021699E4F7751
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xDF2A2AA1400EFF3BD317B2E37E534903
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0xB9DEB54B885743D1B72D90666FEB15DB
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x13A316D6396714F1FCD056AF7E1C50AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x9FA5734BB04A94F18C4306262D030BA9
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0xC3CDB87C5804291300A3CBFE7D9A8CF8
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0xBA03DE7BB210BA6E7D888BBACE660CD2
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0xB0ECE7FE4F52639619A3395FD3C4A9B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x829A6EBFD5E48EA6E91A47D29D7D1D50
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x1FAB74DBFD6303AD9FE14A29F0755127

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x780442080EF66B4ECBF2EF4AB8DAFEA0
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x03DB27989B6FB03E185318E7CFA0932B
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xBBF307802F01EAAF7B80D36DCA044668
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x3FF44F2E8345E12DADF8B565EDAAE251

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0x05E31C32F58E14ABB09DA61FF4097AB7
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0x80455536E2AEF4940CC6B1328724B776
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x61A3083C39D0C8256D83D4FFE03CF107
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x1CC7A4A5D88E3478982454623EB0C49B
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x8F65F86A323F8271E8E3F61E2BB4E63D
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0x40FFE6E23744929A2751782078FB2F8A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0xEE81BD5118F4F2F201CBD17E6B41034E
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x6F41B594FF71863ACFD1357185047660

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x86D7B22FAE2FE3537CB248BE0CA0A617
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0xDB6F39BB6EBA27546841458099B7B319
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x5791AA29494BB1FDDB9C3B48EB85B004
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x2446AF5E8487EC0834899B6F1B95D51D
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xF71EA64A387717FFC79B935FFDD793D1
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x7B9998BE7B15C1889454C92226D7C52E
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xE6FFEC1CF12A9DF94CE1B2A6C6A4E5ED
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0xCF031CF6AEF0458613FC564F6332CB2D
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x4DF9E1CFA5656B9C7F9EDFF5A8A41195
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x76B71C58C5487AFD9596D45D9F93CC51
strength for anything.
0xB86A2072FA78443D932BE717F9C4440D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x35A566D048B093A4625ECB84F6D090CC
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0xFCD9B02FC9F058D7EA21B5A4C54BF883
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.

CHAPTER XXIV
0x82FE79C26BDA63F5D694124EAB22129D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x9EEBBE606684A92CEEE957CAE0553CFF
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xC8371033A1645A267337C5AF9AC19C61
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x2BCD899984E17FB1C74054192901E5FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x5CF51A2A6ADBA495F66DFCC8363CFAB7
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x877DE6F8627F802CCD160272BF895F0A
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x20077A6D26AAAB9A12074ACD78DED7FE
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xBDFA40511A78848C56D8773D24DBE49E
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x807F8D2BD0F7B43EF5C7ED9E7BCABF2A
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x1BB0FAD73F97C09162661FE789933C35
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x8D09DEAD3AC26AD5526D8398994D9E69
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x4D88DD36CFDFEE7CC7D99124ED2AAE05
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xEB99791DC861C569C130097495C96D7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0xDAEEAA622BC0DD43D3F63D9C43DEEE70
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0xD7D9DA543F11D0080DA731752309A9B5
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x5DEE23203C0F5E4C6FAD9CA393DB3808
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0x5CC74EFE9A6E5026DAF473E7A2CCDDC9
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x57C5E1B54ED3CC89BEC2C22D6E9A833A
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xDB726B2F6AB7DC0CA0CC98838CD24F23
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x3D778E32D89F976E3899DD15D8DDFF71
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xF3D63F39762CFA3AA9E4CB8AA58A5B45
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x0EBEA1F7926DBD5F1CFC89F9124161FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x3A1D12D0EBC307751F30804899F651F0
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x81363B2566F57A97F6C59C2D474C0C92
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x1662A0398AB7CFFDB694B1DFF43BA157
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0xABE18A2EE8AA51B9E60179618993EB5D
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x64C51020A3F79E9CD277AF66158CCAA1
schoolroom.
0x7B5D80EEA81F3035A207C28FB48B9ABF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x4F6C309BEB68E3093B6CA2F18C0CA5BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x4C405E34A4B91E4D4A508097AC48FE77

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where is he?"
0xE96CDDAA2962839C6D6B053A1D39E0A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x76A1CD2832D0C44A30AD6F42F18FA2ED
there he stood.
0x3139A35AD0AFF13F22FCB2F2F43642F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0x13AF2F955DFEEFBC7266D191DC7FB7C8
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x08558D02EF7AE1B5C1AFE373DE30242A
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0xA4DB59B7FE8B40A1E48A56969C87735D
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x81E1CBBBC71D63E38106D6B7A52F6F2A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0xC43C51E185C6C56D3AE2C91EF032CAD8
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x9A04A98B631215E2D33A7332DC43EC77
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x67532384427FF173E45A6F0771CCC0F7
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0x5A667E3FC1A769E9469D707D6364268B
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x301C3AD8D400AF5B2E36D35CD343A553
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x2CDD9A53FBC9CAE1CEDD17BD618800D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x70C3C6891C612EECB963D6C463D46DC5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x27A2A9022B2200F2CE8DA64EDA1B8253
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x5CCFFF2F6634B28342C5CEDAEA824CBB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x50164548346444A51BD259F16163623D
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x4496932B404ADF888D5ECA0D9ED1102D
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xDAE42A2749F3093E5B796DA3A554513E
think almost fear.
0x59419072780590BD4698C2B3E81CD44B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0xCCB2F1DAFA25F5A15A34D2DDD22C7399

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x3F610579AE7A8500B206DE3387F05BC4
strange."
0x7A10CDB70E9C455B84F8B782D52164A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax

to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be

your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xF4D46E95AD392EF22ABEC8AE38A4966C

I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he

was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my

would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as

He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This

very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xB5C87455EA176DAC7BD2AC8E8032889A
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0xAA5B5BE50B636B74372775975F686810
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0xF3D5112DE025EA0569AC7C2A106B8B67
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x8B3D8AAA48D49043FD9B780E5F6BD98F
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xE6AAFD599CF00F86C2789F9A6F8D6550
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x5B7F0157C2658715E9B80C8C2035A989
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x6E3D48501BE279CB60E9E90FAE2ED3DF
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."

Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0x49895FEEEE4514D3C159D33B1ED16A5C
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x51125770EC142077554F3615719579F8
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x97CC1E462EFF52E0C14CF956B29819F0
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xE3BD3E7492C9A08B0E0C95257F8356C3
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xECA59805C1A2B4AA64CCBCB9904273BA
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get

it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all

"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x50B249CABF3F03979D84C2A952A39F71
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x9A598DCE97DE11D6BE19ED5DFB200ECB
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0xA5F22F0F85C3EBEDE6E77BB7AF732920
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x967B24857D073D545C067A186929D79A
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0xCF6BBDA411C8E5B88C66681189C65E2D
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x0B67B4F102659CD764329F7B44AA8F98
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x37AABE0CCF85A40CB04A6D65F7D04FEA

yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_

perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,

made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once

am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0x63A85E6A20A713B1D0B4B3F61EA7984A
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0xD07AA81A34FB7FC3553D5661B4120F31
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery

beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that

no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as

some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled

up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0x4065805ACA2DFD87710618412C8A78C6
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0xC63EFF784D6315A5E1F90D474913EA15

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xC6FDF9E82BF83BF35D31339B9BDE8622
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x07EF615B216E297422A7375E0F4F3EFF
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0x2A04660702FF137040F01DE5CF38848D
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x0165F394A0DD1FBEB46FB5EB360373A7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0xB265EA2B6066131F69F0D951BB26BF3C
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0xA789E25FB6B3C101892D1333A791D3EB
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0xC1B83D8CC982A18F71D4B199F275F951
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0xD0312C2123338F283DBF91F38160D9AF
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x51A1895740A27F25962F6D01BA6B7155
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x52CE9B45C84813B33723AC6601013C13
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x6521C4BD01C4BBD61244310911EDD160
made me the offer."
0x1A0113473986CEACAEA581DA1E39C7D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x07E606E530CC137FB5555D39A02E73B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0xE71C784A8E2D56805FFAA88EC74EAFD1
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x4E97B6250BDF693C15A9B8CF9B6602D7
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0xD2210B3ECD7A92AA3F46C6B44EF7A4F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x2D7CB699B43BEEBD308F0EF1986E15DE
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0xDED68ADC9A7A45574C4D8B7D4F8ED160
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x01E76A97183A12693C3BD701D0C37563

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0x31B2EFD498FE48180E56838A2F465519
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0x1E1614680436599C0C1140B1DD9D5A66

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x9862B31DF5A534BF39B31E93ED5746F9
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x03FFFFC448B54A72A31F307E26094FFE
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0xEB954C449FC47756DCC60FE8ABC87D10
deserted?"
0xBD1A04696DF654DD6962298E6F52BD4A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x7AFB2C22F916346F67E247AF411AB1D7
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x6278C6133C5E29F05B9E31E69512D3F4
moment."
0x74481DAAE2874642668AF7C7389806A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0xCDCF9A78AFB73E027DC5D7FFE2E2F4E6
principles on some points are eccentric."
0xB27035F433D4B7928EA77E58F95BCD0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xEA707C0D6B35CD62F6EB375D7961398C
awry for want of attention."
0x175C7D50A12F06BC1D4C57E1B56EBE21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x3DDAEAD70F33C38D41E5C19B097B2000
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x4A531B8B12D8718706DF0B22AF3A1D4E
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x5D21261D0FF5219E7041344FE597B185

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x1759A6C320644B1169955A8DE28CA252
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x4F454D6F4A60F7F442FB373BB4750A2F
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x2738A9C4FA1D51AF1B5B5CCCB263D374

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x73FD3CDE5013A7B1608DE0BC280DC5EE
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x641703BF562A28896604D0D645E9C9D4
express.
0x914733D38084F36EE0E358BA558DDE9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x8FB6B6577AA0E8BF3C2FFD91567F0AA6
entreated, and to yield."
0x6680C90CE6EB26CAF16A83B3C29A1031

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x645E39A58EA274BFD2ABFB8BD299641B
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0xCA64237C655B959F90603D3D2DDCA922
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x0184F646F93BE5A32E79CDDFAB246466
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x47AF94F8E36948A2E718AD3CE5161FED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x84B82DF57D466176875FB8E6B024DB5C
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x350B63ABD7173A840643D20350020B3A
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0xBAA0D250628DF53681DA36FA3EA4E439
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x53CDD4E2F7274FAF4BAE25BA3A8438F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0xE6921182AD72F4C6F696E7344CC62A58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x60762071E5D7CCC5F2350D1AA39BF5DC
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0x84460511AA392CECC39842B907873633

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x6309BF3A6B8931C9DA9CAEF1D2954F0F
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0x2BDEBEF06CEFE526B020F35C1A4D1042
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x7821025EF12B87F12E593DE0B100BFA1
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x8383D7A342CC2ED719FDDACC6B5C5F98
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0xFE5A1A8EB4DBA301A62A0DCFC551997E
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0x50E35D1EA3403DC7647A7CF41611F5B7
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x8B412F5F71704D1EA3E24814530B8FAA
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0xAFE68BD7D89A0C626F17D7674ECA8797
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x316FDCAD2334027756DC8A4FB6018248
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0x5CA096C35DCFAA5EB3341EB992F458AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0xF1BB717751C02AFB9ABFB87AF90C0655
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0xE5F261717C1E9B2E3098226F4C2A5228
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x1AAFCC6E51C81A12AF5E1DA7A3CDA966
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x5A30E13EB4719E70875D93D4A65E55BD
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x56F00160A8B3F3EAD2C463F6D618AB75
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0x314025C42E2F4A5AC3A83C6EE4ECC2AB
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0x365CBE6A9D311F40E3B9E293227E2A5F
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0xFABEC24FB9C652A0085DD9C69827BC91
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0x0DB862F6E8235FF05D89032421649C60
you would be his wife."
0x14B87FCE22262E8BE7B64EB9107063F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x052EA877A42F677EA3222111071A7DB1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0xF3864A0507AC5ECF4E9F8A25CE7C4C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x4B7E26D6C9F11C23F5B88C743E3B3395
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xA79C135D148280E440858D031A69540F
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0xD1F1CC578B031D763402588C5619A223

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He tells me so."
0x0A76119ADF3F6FB3A809C973D26591A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x0AE2C656BC6C53DE0179C9B42BC45D08
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0xF12EC182BDD92D058155D69C5449CC50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0xB0C981B31CF74D1F1386566E8E5F13E1
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x54B0398100112734EC7FA30816833723
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x27FDD32688DEB791A58585F450E12444
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0xF9B555E9BD8043716987278C9AEEE310
father."
0xD01600F3C2FD5FD3DEE4DB1C09E6AA36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0xEA05F7EE1838A113C5F43A13978571DB
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0xBFA6349849C74A141C12D3D31D18A578
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x4A92DAA4FB5F97EC9BEB73401EBE57B6
twenty."
0x5A6183E0C78ED6FA6EE8C046A6F67683

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x3AF64B058A66FB51B5D176D64E969FDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x62B3144DF17518D0AAC74E3148478356
eyes.
0xD8E4D47C89756FD10941311D8A2AF364

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x7A1FA9042F1AAE708ACD5FD78CEB88FB
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x77B77D99581EDA329BA35D12941BEABB
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x2ED4E6FE453842FB7E2EAE8907B77521
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xE7C07E69173B85EDE95FFC41DB53EABE
I expect."
0x4443082E6E67A7545D85784B018285D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xC037141194200DB3CBA92DC78FC88957
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x54EDF13AD3184366946424AEDF7770B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x3A89A77D0047B2562D08A88E77127511
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0x5B5F01EB251DFF1CD13E126717871CED
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xBDEE53D4C705FED61D575A0776F081EF
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x936881B82963221B4E4C0ECCC629101B
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x987117BE886ABA01FAB7B589DCF15E0E
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x007C58D3781A4F48E72ACC6929BC3225
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x38D7D5B7588643BB276116436E54051B
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0xBE3E3FAF56123F2D9E4A8C33DED06BFA
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x3E63F07B37D9463C161658B95C3C2A72
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x6DE4D688039A68C274B213A99BD0559A
him."
0x6D9A5291301E528B2D3933C47727F230

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x7C59D8562631949E153FCD1470339350
that all was right."
0x952FFF88C3F8E168E2849DA8EEC281D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0x04A6D740DB16FC73CD74EE6FE2242FAF
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0xC6A80F21E7AA25E24E89C4A5235EC007
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0x14BC33CC3C130EDDE41FC59802B845EE
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0xCB70693D50AA0633147E3E6AFAD667BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0xA23FD93162C177AED8C517B7F8AB69CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0xDC1E819D5CA17BE83A1C55B4CFE90625
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0xA061D320FFF8C55A10FE581F93BF195D
me go mademoiselle."
0xBA5C5F2F016B4352857287B4EC3BA084

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x0DA48D91887BD5BE98CA7EDB5690EBBB
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x78FB0278CD36D582F14238855809EEA1
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0xE253D9508D5B32D855FCB2860F999FED
backwards and forwards.
0xC0F8398300A9535DB0C71A573438E1E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x646EF048D8107C6F21420A398C1D5E15

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0xFB4F452F3B9AED23E79402164D5FA977
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0xEF7F8301BD2536EFE3F9B7E2750D6B75
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x7E92CCBFA0662AD6CAD27D268D83CC4F
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x65899A1DCB3E801DC5DEB2211BC59723
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0x499BA389F703AAECF2E556649E5665EB
my face.
0x102B8A5B4F154C61DFD0158B60527994

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x90EB560DE1C572C6D930CC528070EDFC
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0x21751AE9C9063B78F7365EE4F3978439

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x498DDE8E0F22793FFCF6F224824B96BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0xD0E6F27018450FE48449212AA9B7628F
to Adele.
0x8AEED7FAECBD64075B7F1B55E34217C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x6A71255773DFC3E69F95D38FD2E6CF02

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0xA976B140D3D09067A8BF5A0F6ECE368F
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0xBC8B15CB07536D72732CA3EB399F03CC
company--for life."
0xEC3AC393130D588F80E2798815503132

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x1C34C106D5D7E262E6E0493C5552C9FF
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0xB6C45AC4031CBFF2D7E6A01840818A37
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x517CC81AAE510387EA5D345F2B48E2A1
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0xACF0160D7334323B1328E9C38BE04E4D
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x58530E32422AF60AA1D6C31989FBA297

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0xED880A61D18147E9D706E7362CE4919C
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x34BC1BF5A13CC56B69F6233AD9CF553F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x842A7FE436F4FD735DF7EA9B3C5B94A0
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xCB9545304094024DF32AC81021CF8F96

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0xE52CAD0F6A14AF58019F1937128B175C
mademoiselle?"
0x59D37D98FAAEB26703405EB65FF5471C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0x0CF6C4833796699C7C349B798F9387CB
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x6DCB7179CFF16FCEFF28A3452788522E
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0xE748FB8B67F30CA8622DEE1A83E60C9F
there, and only me."
0x8176009B292803DB01A516867DA3E6B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0x9DFB8DBD3608A6CA9998165242D95F0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x7E1F4A32BEAC1A9ED9847BB802ABD091
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x5F65F4913939EC12A778B87B900AFE6A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0x1A91AD002BBF5EF60309FE58F0F600F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0xA068A28F565B79D65D51D49C53413858
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xA6115B32E04EA7A0A7D3C8BBA1EB417C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0xBCE6B10BFBC64AB1A591852E71B020DE
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xDD9EF4010DCD51C7A67B83052524B854

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x36C4E181D970B5740CB9E33699C9BEE0
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x3ED137D2F4E80BF10F8CFB3E705027F2
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x526D52F7DB0502486D7351991B7C0712
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xCA1BE141479BD95119E32D3F7554B052

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xB8D1025A8DC16CD2BDB576D450D7F4ED
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0xD437D41EA6A9249D476F44FDE0F0C28A
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x8FA2EA981C98DDD4B00B9A8D97305F70

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0x0330771D99A15565D370D5B24FEC970D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x9F8C63BBD6F72AE042D0F35507A2B80B
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0xA8082A3486356C0BF2011226A889BB93

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0x97C7919A2C1CBB91B0940E124C4E705D
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xBF627B6A497D508A6F52DA1899D24818
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0xA8B0C2866149050BB22D4A71EA0BCBCB
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x2E04B4BE7AFC59E393A5E8B433A71E3B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0xF1C5EEE79EC5C33258E9B522E867FDAF
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xE8BE0740C73AF93AF96DB47344A88242
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x01F3EB8A4A85C8D9D272648B900CD72B
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x343BE0ED13D976C3F607DA7C59CA0DAA
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0x6A7C1C7768618D0753EA227A310BB34A
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0xF3D67D7D92A86C8C9A70C4A2B1D025DA
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x185660EB057BC5C1AEDEC5EFAD41C551
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xCB2E795CABF8A61BD68970A1E506444C
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x61BB6776197425F2FC9368AE55A12A67
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0x9D058F4981768A8E3EA8642A85A9C90F
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x157DD0FA58492671C07CCFFEBD1F6F45
effect--
0xE7C1547DDABC3B9ED1CD38D1B35A46F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xA6AB044E8A16FCD337643EF599F0B4CB
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xAA9AE4569F2F62986719A42245235E5B
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x017D050A6053C884D854925243587D38
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x9C9B685053DCC18D6678D13662F2487B
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x022F66460BE79F5F2F15ED6FD12F8151
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x9475A09B7A7850204DFC2CF6CAECA8E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0xED5A800095E5CA723235184D92D09354
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x71E3C2C8D5CAEE63646EEC9AC2AAE4AE
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0x2403EE8F39A9BC60A9620727512EF493
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xBD6DD0E27C5B3A3F91E65CB68E88700F
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x294CAA39EBF1BE5D42562DE82DAB93F4
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x24ABE1C83AE19B19755360208AB434E6
again."
0x09A175CAA216E60202E89061B92A02D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x40BA6B8ACD0B69F698EE6EA9B11233D3
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x3AF6BD89C52B2B4CBEE45FC0C7B36256

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x5B32407317E0AC37AB7ACB0BA4F2B437
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0xFD4DB29D44E0C9BE6CAF4D27D5AD0EB1
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x44BDD615E5088FD78315CE4A370E89EB
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x100322E7265E444BA72694FFDA53638C
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0xB47363E7C8D8434E2072CCC84DB6B813
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x35B2F1C52006E28C04B0D14F445C118F
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x9E68CD29FF40FF2DE53CEFEC1CD63B03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0xD968B18FB34AA6D30541D8E92032C271
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x65A09B3A1A1BF21AA55C50BFF5914DFD
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0x4166067153A5C2FF80ED61DF5A6BF839
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0xF686A4124BC4C549FCF7715CA29743DB
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x44922F3C22B9F582D3FC57F0A0E2B2AD
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0x4A90B19F38BA3638E61E0477EF15F287
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x9B019F844742A6281670589778AF23E4
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x8B713DDE738AFB3D18E5A1A54C7AA0F9
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0xF09050DDE03B72E653C9E7E45F017705
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x01B4D07E4FE44EF0D17CCBF3F5F70774
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0xB3684C18F4648E6F9672CC60F7CFDB6A
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0x77EBDFB798798801BEFC9C6BEE1DA2A9
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x6C1790D533921B31E009118793EC5560
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0x3C986CFB6FB5E910AE9E9B38729AD727

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0x7215FC10B1754B7C5D1573DC166A07B9
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0xE612E04FCFDDC5B3BB6626C670EC90FC
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xBAC1B3D531DA37A083B292BEBF52DF93
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0xFC319A43928A4D45F886FEF8464084BA
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0x3BA55A9D0D7DF24AA913ECA4436DECB6
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xC386E7BE976DDACEE0A6746B105DB9E9
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x7AC954F262059AD41AC335E186DEE418
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x533F0CF143CC88508DAE649910DBECDD
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x4C5B2153E3630518D2E947C2FC78C63E
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x6E9491F83DC248E242A7312C3BD1AB71
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x7598930604A9E9E0A0A9BF0D0B21DC12
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x02136A4516B2F85BF2207E0F909851DD
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x6C75DA99BC8561284610BB01DA25DA25
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x82EF857538CF1E1AE039D4E2BABE7ABE
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0xBDD9B07BE35568B8DCB64A07DD24DD5A
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x6B42B34F22C14A43BE8DEDDC2A2790D5
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0x089CA97A7C37467C1C88C1A80DE57F08
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0xD3437E42A0021AC2231F578B4D8EEA8E
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x66AF8D337AF040AF4539AD6BED44FD3F
passionate pressure.
0x314094F025F8B2D89B95AA10650DF5C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0xE3BAC991FD6B062E911F48AD4EC1BB10
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x013BBC96F26265AEF29D75B0D8FAC9DC
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x747EFB0F2B684688D9765CDAF8C1FC6B
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x61BD28691B1932C27B0785BD975A1CF5
satin."
0x41A768BD108FECC32A910305E3928037

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0xAEB6574D0952AB6C22AC222C207CD5D3
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0xF6FA8585FF8DE6BA8C93327AA053CC1D
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x65B77CCD7A3AB45E46163AFCDAA1A7BB
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x63CA1B7B354773CF8EF9748A74547E1E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xCEFB7D71635B803DF31631496AEC60D6
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x16231248E8788EA9C35C2D434D8726DA
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0xDBCE58FDD210510EFDCBF80BE5C3F756
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x59512A6C19AFBAA92D724812AA192DFB
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x7925ED45C6A258AD83A0A707CE73E9AD
satisfactorily here."
0x40D2CEC6C0D7D079E15BFC6DE3B0B9AD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0x9FD75E51130224475ECACF61D3ED05B2
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x8C8D2790C6542FE6233AC7CDDA666516

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to

He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0xB17BA383BB3A325B33359719E459A9A3
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xA183902EFA3003075B0265CA6A7CF113
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x4CA384424A4EAEB4F1A29BDE390655F3
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x09BFD22476C5667C96D5EB3682130ABE
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0xA275402F5A2D5144AA3193A1B3B87017
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0xD938A2DB67811214CB2380420E2E6DF2
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x19BE980AB9D802845BF36EF36D9D2A22
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0x07B7F7C0B735F701B1D73BAB940DD926
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x7E488EBCECEF05381CA8C2B031A49747
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x525381E5C3C9359D0343542BC6A86C0F
the present.
0xF54C4CD4A29CD8A0D3DF702C780F878E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0xE61BE0952A51B7E295A492D6EC4532EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x41C221C60193578F1228317B3FE63AE7
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0x7165044ED245EA4B0B3B045E403FB46A
stimulate it.
0x72BD1586FB548BEB02987F2E873863BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x64C9BA09ADAE64EADFDE31B6AF2FBD9A
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xFD76C58D38281FBC131E053129E5EC8C
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0xC8D1B666A49FD0BD027FDB8AADA6E925
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x0C9295A9AD26C9EDB548A30AEDEEFFEB
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x6AFBF4474E9403359E4638B63D9D3D21
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x32FEC7FBC8A0913DD03378A0B4D8AAA6

      As I loved, loved to be;
0x9C1EFB31001E6692A8B96B51190EB644
   And to this object did I press
0x1C9CD5A8333C108AA9ACA5E42C296369
      As blind as eagerly.

      That lay our lives between,
0x8EA558EE774E108231A7D1FF1F20E7E2
   And dangerous as the foamy race

0x59FDF260A0A72B565D305008398622C8
      I omens did defy:

   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x16000970639D62DC63E3C53BDAF2276E

      I flew as in a dream;

0x0BA852EAE1C3B547795A47198BC6A9D5
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0x6EE40BBBF47CA5EC60557947DD9B3774
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x492325BD1538287EF62F265D63D53E9D
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x2567927D5C7864070ED1D44A37C9BFFE
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x43E3B09D6A62B1B9669B64A176EC9F7F
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xAF6C828B35C02C70FF00A7AF9AE099D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0xA2F2C20155CD0B363C2FCDF29D6FD00D
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0xAF16D6B19B70517CD4968188B1F84631
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x4FD07F165F40B582461287922FEC15C8
Death was not for such as I."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: I would rather be excused."
0xE6DE597A8A785200659A54FE49C6AB11

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x862586DF03E02E669830CA6114E90FE0
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0xAF504379E96CE4B844516E95E4B5B112
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x475131AAA3FC899D97509310C65B1578

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x9AE1C3B85F373B3D35E11B177E8A12F8
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0xCC6C8CD34A6272DEBDCD2359A39719BA
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x9213D16E877D03A7C537785255D7F3DF
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0x5CF25F0F35D705156354F494061DDDB7
time to rescind it.
0x700B4F35A6F8D039A1E4E4344E023AB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x256507A67806651785B8E8594E18F467

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x23F61B586AD720DB4C554ECA39C6BAAE
myself I was doing that now."
0xCA0C1CDC2C94F4777DF8A508D8443C42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0xC34AFF0B8B4753FB36D6D3E734C26CF9
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x50A4E05B89B47AF168360A3BADC1BAEF
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x493AF84A848371F28521CD116D072670
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xCA9FFFCBFB6A4B8D095842E7B2C2866E
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0xACF4BC736481AF5B004BF1A8F97D2965
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x9143D144F6C3673C824E37C90608B664
advantage."
0xE36D688355A2EB643182A7532345B56E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xAED9A67363B152FA14DD194D3F19EDC7
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0xCD155B748CC01FF77BBB2A3CC445B6F5
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x6EB46C81958322348F2FAEC1B61D459F
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x4289EEA416C19307B4FC53F23EA0F63C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xB0A4B65537A9A05A5F6D46A658D9F7BD
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0x033AD08949F6A3F10BC148D5011B55C5
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0xCEB509428BE8391AD20DCB40BEA6E078
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0xBE3FAA713504410CE9F1358E91482103
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x3FD4129BFA424A8FFD55DB472C98FB89
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0xDA0208B900A890D0E8C9A3B78F764313

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xDC6930EDB6D7651D7C21E63FB194FFEB
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x6EC26404DDC304AD02F315AF16C3DB60
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xD01DA99F22F0130645D72F1A0A54EA88
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x6A7057154877FB0C3A0DE74C45C602D9
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x2BF8386432A37DBBA14DA3E301C0B495
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x68F821AF82001F0613E948B0BF6A35B2
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0xE4DAA411DA4E42B1441815B05E9A7320
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x26D6702FB3EBC6F80087DB5BF5986D59
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0x54B4C8B4E1C1D2DB3CF1CC27F68D93DE
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0x96862F5AD36567F552DD3F3A268678F8
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0xC31E9EFCCE9D07169135BD61A77DCAF2
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x61AAF1BE64179D8B6AA17CE4A4402E23
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x2A11A7C2225F1D3BC263705486BF0F9D
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0x372049ED08945D42408E6A5B241B3F3C
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x200C0F2CDE9E20F349D47C2447365C66
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x8102F81AB79AC826DD5916DA71241E39
virtue, another must be devised."
0xE3658B86F749CE180CAFC1E5E18AB338

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xA01F26DFA6EB8F9C2C3E2E797D5BECE5
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x8544FE922CBE670062EBD40A6E425427
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xE910C75490A1B033803286D27FC4407D
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x3B14F6E9A41BF6ADDD5AC774F31CF25D
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x1044CC4DC2F500FAB6E7496EE95E73F9
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0xF30A2665F2B1CC9556B03A2F33D1A6BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x81E38B04FC59CD77F2D0D668BB4B0883
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x8CF4EBA55DD956B698E4F25FF1D3AE13
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0x26F9F8120CA004A88B64EE402F08F516
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x9BE8C4971C6F3266D362049A8B5EBE42
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xDE0BBD8C1EBB59AE8E30D064B1A65232
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x02BAF9406061A951A0404379F3331E7F
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xDD1CC4F06824B980A2F784EA1303AD38
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x409DFFD07F8D0672E265D97F4C051DCD
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0xEA04B011E29912D6A6AC06CD2823DCD3
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x578CBBA186AA9D3267E37B63AA6C9DA6
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x9387BB8B99231DA4FDEC11234C58AB08
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0xE0BB743CCE5E39312D78D5B1A35CEBFB
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0xFEE05C37CC14886279C4329B7B790380
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x992B0D68747C9CA5940137BE8A3D6DEE
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0xF5C9AEBF71BA724C9DF6B64D43E0FB35
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0xD86D14044BDE4B3B38C754383189D698
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0xF39FB64E6D74E6E770F2CFDFA296D79E
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0xC9FD7EC461949EA5DC7E7CBA358966E6
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x78B2570AB9557A0421480CFA033F4AC4
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x8DCFA8788C53BC1C9913E4B0D563DD05
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0xBF31FC2A0413011C9A1354BD88A5D970
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x712CECDB8F3B4990B9B2A5A3C967A4C7
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x215C5150F8E6BFEC613668585C378A11

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x65FA85FA4C84D8295D483EB3F2838BD1
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x6DCB416E2F58C4EE013B3A25EF181D23
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x51AD07C598AD9F1AD21759338BA9B15C
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x87527DE5C34955D7809AEAFCA98A7DCD
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x93613C686699610D90DA45534967087E
more than they.
0x3E756CF85737842F9999BD2D58A580D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0xC5CDF5959DB9107007D553FE80AEDCAA
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0xDA516332E96350C190E189C518CAE8E3
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0xEEA1BEAF8D86176507C1720262CA342A
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xBEF35622AC16D67B795B0B93BE3FA1FC
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xD6273E6D8ACF650B48DAF5EAF47128D5
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0xD46CA59E945FF5DE60489DF45440B251
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0xEE68449F03C218224B63B83746D52BAD
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x2127D8310B7B7194CD4B4BCFFC88AE75
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0xE7797CEBDEF8DBAA8E130BF68287CCF9
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0xE82E4EBBCACEAA9E1AF3A2A69C5E4803

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0x5EA5420C2C7E3ED8F7B7A62BE0B32B67
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x0E4630CD3919B46D19A1A3D73056F0DC
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0x5349E6624A4EE6368BD3612FFE755362
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x7686AD52038533E85B461B5B044966AF
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0x6C564AC7DE569B6D7929523642A2FB80
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0xDEE215913F23B86EA0D1626E5E9ABD18
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x8AFDC347DBBAC2E2714EE10130EF6696
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x74878DEC0F7D80166D937F177F00E2DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x2C91F2CED589A2A33CDDCEC8BA5E8535
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0x826C41341B7C44EF6E9045BFFDB82C8F
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0xDC3DE886BE68B72F1525DF7F63AC7FB4
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x97783F040134230A9639968246BD6A6D
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x6390BBD55CEDAB650EC6047E96A79E79
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0x75FE5A027A9F7E6AB6F912D3BDB7CAD9
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0xC62B8EC0D4FAAF8928DABB5E27A5AF7C
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x627D6CFBE584068D437876987556EAF2
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x6519B7DFF65F819EFA27E1A04B9C058B
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x853983AAC8D35D1D0ABD548BAF743349

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x57F4981C1445C5CCA3EFB19BD8434838
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0xF1284A69DE972CE9368DD60652DD4B0B
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x3DB8BCE922254909344598E941CB0E56
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x4B290B12E793E0388BC84988B4A6B234
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0x6990F8097BAC31DF6E69DFB7D2BC286D
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x5A55F390155DFA012F77B96F1CD939EF
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x693E15EAD203EDACC91935FCF9C395F6
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0xD37CC469F407D7D85394876D0E8D927F
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xC699466A68F67BEA85CBFFD3326A3885
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0x37F5FD99A3BA33EE35F6BE0078FDC5F8
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0xC2F158ABA5ECE5B829B1A56F062E0BCA
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0xDD4DFDE3EB9C6E9EE893CE1071F045C1
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0xE1BDC6B01297D0018EE7980D4E3EA356
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x922F964E191A72C22EECAE0C82992493

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x330E27299019818AC30118C660446DCF
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x9AA61F1F7B956DEDA1BFD7A21429F41B
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0xCD2E1124F825C2BAE6B50FDA006FDE62
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x88B2B8047298B7E3C9DBC3956DE6D9A5
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x35C831A80C66F42A4695CF0D6D81BA98
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x45A1781C9D0CE9D4F1EC380CA48EDB85
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0xB6782703CDBC269AAE65209BE8980106
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0xB41DDFF408C45986163F4C05979C0572
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x17D4C94BC7517785B1D7074E90A6F702
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x4A35AC18B9A034F6AECDECFF150125C2
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x44E87F09BF47E98978D96A2B97BFB65F
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0xB9C0D6C0CFD60BEE4747944DB31634F3
simultaneously struck ten.
0x90B3EA51770C9DB7DEA3E54036678864

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0xFA93932049C39D3266D6B65040130656
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x6E8056FD5FE25E69254FE4441D3DE650
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x1A522C95170A495A26BC30F41484FE7C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xB3D9A24347642E1DC111B49EBE36AB2E
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xFB8658D267490CD5BC8929A403026060
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x418633C456498432EA0E74732AFC0D49
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x619F2CD05E75D009A8ED51BEB5C318EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xC4E0568FF4D53A9BD4529C73F10EBE62
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0x99242DD0C089AEFDC1ABC4FF302429A6
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0xE1C69E4A7AE676970DF6730E99026071
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x2C3335A9DA2269483029CF53B5D6532B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x5455484562C7E14A35BF6FC38CB79B5A
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0x406F195878C9739338359792CB976784
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x3578A23B1AEF8830ACF152D7C19F2259
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x1994F30C72FBD4D97FD6F69738DC643B
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x7ADA0B477236FE1D3D2844991D6090F7
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0xE476EC0CDB81D7937B52CB87F27FC0A4
meridian, and must now decline.
0x11C37AEE1A6A1C2E90FF71B47916D35E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0xAF41191613A9DEB93B9FEDDA97D04610
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0xE96065A376E7B0C7836D16854619F00B
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0x29E0EDEC8DEF3207692E75BC3F625B5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0xFC902156D6377CA88DD54F2F895D664C
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xDD5155325732F6D5A0DBE2D1E8713106
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xBE78C4C2E61842EAFFD85BF568B6BBB1
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0xD68068AE73BE27F0264B32DF6C9C9E61
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x548F9E019E864EB604C2139B49A4EDCF
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x17260D67ADD1F78EB69B4EFD11FE9670

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xAA9B188C971BA0EA3E7B29CC1CBEE879
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x4A61A26C11C2AA666732130FD228A567
give me both hands: mount!"
0x1437C24257BF8F2D4300E8771EDAF6F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0xD2798B9199C07AA2D33A88B9F6F9809B
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0x0E3F02927F3393A1DABCE3E17DF1AFE7
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x955A87DC01E955E1F379475E3607FCF0
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0xD78A27DB416ACBACE612AF1A3C7C80F4
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x038A15E8BD8420C70678CBDC9EA5ACDB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xD53C0B9DB5E40312BA306ED38C43313E
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x65285366DDC0A31864FA125836E24C21

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x6EAF99223E11781C4255F6FA18896C11
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0xEBC5E4082FCBC427C1FD09B8F642ED84
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0xA20B9E7D86EA2D6D1E5FBA532B509646

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0x11282C24A2158807B789EB1289178057

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you have been both?"
0x16BFD8F2BB7E9E9F6B05551BABA86CED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0x3E69C41EE2E229358D90F7B5355F43F2
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0xCB52014757F5CE5F2C2301463C386877

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0xE23F29919BA4E9320B3F3FF8B836BB5E
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x0EBD34162E1BF4C1433857DF97FA9A46
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x7B1F1884DAE4A0300EF667A9709E6B59
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xCE5EF7DE0B9534C45EF2CACEAFAA2529
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0xBB00D750A16E7A08857F97CFFFF94261
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x310842FBA68045972C96F807C5AC799A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xD11B05B52866720673C8CC253E68C242
get down."
0xBDD43EF29BF375D67616F45B3BF01A6B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x0F7C3CE0909C59FF8EEEFAA960E29D50
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x1B4A5B93BD676187CDDB62F43F3574FB
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0x3BE203A0F79CA4A681F1DCC407F0B5A6
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x4E3CA9C9F38328FD942A040611E19BFD
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x47832F92AA8A49F6F924388C4BB54F72

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x0BA0FD8DCC854AD5CCC47B83969AB64E
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x644D0D33E3A23BFFFA5864E12E7235EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xF5C0B0273D447EC0F11F402FC89BACCF
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0x310551B2A58C5962C37CF0596FE1ECA6
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xFE4093A1DD8FC0FF18894AD084F94342

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x496E4EEA9EC8AE559837C0F5556E666B
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x7A6F32F2EE5171E297906BE5FB81F7DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0xFF66A5E2ABECC2247AA48AF21F4A3E9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x945289BEFCCAF591E38480B142B02D8C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x23D0ECCAB0F74E4EB9D8890FD66165FA
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0x68490534C33E681912943A2AC3809C38
as a long, strong arm.
0xB6F8DBD190858ABC6EFCCE72B2AE2D8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xE75C6D636CF256D4E380CD045CE60684
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x670DF59CB9BE5ECFBADDC7F65A15ACDC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Jane."
0xE715C08BED86785F45106794A67F7158

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0xF0858EC8742E5DC242A9E813F9E5A845
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x54F374375A6F76A314899DCD4ABE6520

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x25390C334DB7CFF074385641DEFDCCBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x2DC765F428810BE50846E5B01AB5DCB9
my wedding."
0x0457E326241B8CAC9B38744268E7B75F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xC9B8C227E5188CC4E9708A6251AC8115
no wish to go to bed."
0x1FAEE66AE219615C372E5E714FD757F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0x3D12CE4F04EF164DFB4CD613366EDB76

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All, sir."
0xEFCEB80AA2A443365DD3E17F9FEC9CED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xEC67F8DDBBA35B1872A9EF245EC205A8
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0x559B9A8785EF24A74DECDD128935225B
from church."
0x5CA01069CDAB2BBE461136B96A799296

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very well, sir."
0x56EA6E6D097B2CCDA1FA97BFA8F338AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0x6760703442D0EB9CD4B1342D9C38AD4C
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x40E1E9B325276BB00CBA8F593B412D92
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xC6AD8BD132DD9601771A7EC44E7410D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe I am."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0x369BDA9643AD4D58F3A759A9783AF6FE
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0xF7F04E66227E25D6B1FF9A35FDA9CEEC
charged?"
0xFC66E2A91B5C4AD39FA1957CC1B2B9C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0x89FBAF9A9ACD780B72F892EE1C941B95
over-fatigued."
0x2CADDA7180C2DE89DEBF81E063683773

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xCC142F25DBA6231828B74B3BF56ABA54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
0x5A3E527A287E5FD740CC8A763365E95F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xF192818B0BE7761BE9ACDA785BEA5797
and flushed.
0x5E0D7E9D7DB5AD0B7E5B04D6F6174379

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0x07E6932F23563276F79D9288289ACB0F
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0x571D645B668D2EF7D7128D00A7215535
I shall not prove a good husband?"
0x91C8C68314781664A2761140D3D0DF7C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
0x9E826222584D664AA111C0613C64D9B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x57B37F16D31A9482234C4CCB7E6CC83F
new life into which you are passing?"
0x4DC70AF0331260D6892B5D975F5C984C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x98BC3D8BC456E49FC2CDC46F1C48C9BD
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0xC9EBEAC59DF1544309EC3254578C5623

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0xB7F0250145BE84D9C74C2C5EB7128C3C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0xE35359ACD2A41A73A1407924172C3E3B
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0x2DEFF3C8AFCB6F78BD8AF5ACA01D7F44
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x585949212A5BDBC318114A09AB2B777C
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0xE25D225A532CD2DBB31BD0825D00A57B
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
0xA061EB0CE9981653133A26717AD5A8C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x92701C8373356833247C468FE82F42BE
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x43A1E74E17F6489C05503553F6FB1229
proceeded.
0x49EFEB50B8653D6BE0EF299DB03D2188

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x671B690BC917E41743BF238D60AB7879
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x9FA048BAC8BC7F35D80DCE7B200937C4
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x0FCA779DE1B69021456328D827F8F893
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xB933FD337BE3F2D697A90E4A8DCFD6C7
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0xB36FBF9405D8080D2ECFFEBAD5F17373
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0xB60CF93EEE2D49D95C9CEA0D20EE8B69
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x39A94F4C84735C3758E2D68B848DE98A
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x0C0E8AF799C70E6278F8E558059DA257
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0x0E7FF045B5685D02FE5680DA4C3001AE
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0xE963C441102DED0A83EE3E08C1E64503
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0xF8A89DB5ABB3DB9FDE386A7AA3FA81C6
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0xCD3518096B73A96E8F5D7074AE175B02
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x9CD0C8798B3A4667C0B16FCD42E52390
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xCA755DDB3A59E353B3B3972FA364460B
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x94516AA44D45BDD91DDF2671E1D9E643
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x27B84D3E668292F7593587F4F293F2A8
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xA1A8E6D0FC01E45C6B8EF343CFEA5205
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x1BF4D4EB679FE2E48BD13055820F9DD9
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0xA470CE221EB88925DF8865D4DDEB1B14
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x9EFDD4F0189F74B66F37DA082A98BFC8
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your

aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x2D061F0A289CD4176C80066D5EEC045D
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x9767ACC69EFE63950F3EE4BA0FB6F6BC
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xCC8382F4E8B19070D83F608BD9FB7516
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x2AB990E1CBBEF2991B7159B75EE42369
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x8B4C486204D496F93E25CF176AB4B49E
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x363F2E1CB174298D9120AFD47E14BAE8
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0xFE1A78984103BB596672D2F15C76B5A4
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x838AE22004E22FB56848C126521D9174
coronet."

"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xF8732A4400DD92F24BF13DE0719A0941
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x90471F574CBB5EE47D1CF0DD114B35FC
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x9D3BFADD7B975C76897AE8066BA6D3EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0xA3951C1FCCB7A1DC7218CA319E9F973D
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0xE2DDE500C178231058E0A5C5AE2985D9
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0xC266CC8A4296E8A63891B91359FD31FD
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0xEA585FC730091DCD4CD3A20F311659BB
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x52B300663D2EA2C590D8E3750CF4B470
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x3C93BC6997D58B425346F3834849403A
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x1CA89A90E59EC998ADC8B61BF609D53F
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x81E7DB25FFCB2A56F31FF4A702458E5B
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x3491F1271801BD7C0E2A54F48DDDFBE8
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0x8BF57E5712E71829419DDD9C57FBC872
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x71F39AA61B60ADCB87FBA9C0210B0BD4
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xB8809AE6BA138102675DAEAB7F6B8386
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x985EA28F090A1504237B03B90EE708F1
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0x8B60438850C6FCC4173E102D1E2FC5B4
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0xFF9D6365253998443D5A4CB6708BB255
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0x63E3B958A3C11FD1B261E4E3D5AE11CA
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x31DFF7CB97273E80B0C60C202445FFDB
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x3CF5DE34ED58C282D3F01C309A132D3A
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0xEA0BC26D8BB1017ABBF4A8F52D0F4F0E
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xAFBBFCC3039D79DDB978819D75AAB841
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x8C7F601EF7A24DDC088EA972CB7C2C09
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x1924C99E244861FB0F9287A2D53F4B10
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0xEBF755E1FCDDA3FB5661318CAED8E0D9
moment."

you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0xE37BA093B45AA0AFA8FAE1C1C74EB29F
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0x0D09C3B9054503768379D0DFCBBA5D77
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0x16134E35E29AB01A2F759A8DD270BD16
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xC82A443CD6443698E7A93C9C0BFE20FB
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x13B3CA8F0D19DD6C5199A04A4802754C
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,

"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x77D536A4716FF7A008720C8BE61DBE63
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x8A88DF332A0A5B58A82916C937BEF2C0
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xCA68DF4499566BBEBF542305E1BCDFD7
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0xAB92AB2D9A965A54BB13DDC6F3E1E730
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0xF53EF66A17172E7A3786E54E8E842764
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x4B32F31D93BA75938CCFDABB07BA51CF
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be

incensed than saddened."

of your melancholy in a dream."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be

anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0x7CE01425C954DB0E0CB301DC8FBEC0C3
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x8719016EE7A78202C27B3EE29EB5CAC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x482446B725D786AD876071C91F89AD03
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x2D5739A1A2A7EB7EAC95D1F97525868D
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x6A89B440A3A4871CA7C7144F8429A04F
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0xD2AF69B8B7884F684AAD1E2723621016
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0xE592669FCA6218B5EB61634288C400C4
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0xE6CD1486DBAB1F816711A214B637D5A5
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x3408D6940FFB64910524E615ECAFE65C
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0xC4AA89A5E7202856CD48200D9B8D5555
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x26CA1AB606767C1712D93645E8A8DC61
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0x20CC8069B497E3C6011B53431F193EA6
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0xED35012768BC58981A85DC2358623F0C
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x4D379E323F4594C3C9A33D7167DC9D92
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0x1A3131668736A67EC2AD9E52ACAAE865
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0xAA2F88EC2D6A6CBD1DEE2D0E426D6B1C
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x2587AB577E34CB470C59C9C7D997C2BA
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x0F29391C75334992617A1D857810D8F3
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0xBBCCB99A8F94D64FDD0CAF76C5448E9F
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xCA33373C6C4BAE3681F17D6D568B3084
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x072A8D5E224EEA6E5AA35CD3C325CD76
woke."

"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0xF1EE0D2BB02D9131DD8DC21851CF4D24
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xD9369B048A72752A8DF58D41D6759571
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x085139DA425CA2787B8EC3526FDBD8E8
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x87ED7C3B6B8FF15C505C377443B4CABA
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x9ACF3136E3522125DFBFC9BF1E0F41D0
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0xB53785737581681EAC9008E3EB2DE28A
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x78328595ED3048FC8C75DA2CEB578A6D
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x87CCA0FD3503A94699B5E4BCF7D46EBA
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x3F472409542A25559460D1414E7E5801
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x3D22DF9F1DAF36BC3867EF5838213C8C
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0xC98DEE8AB771F0CA7A143548DD293A9C
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0xF108D43338D51F7DF2586070BCAD6D21
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x0AC50F92935529C66A8B2343C0857998
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x2C088F2A2FECD2AB95DEAFE851B45103
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0x3444E6F3CD9881D1392B95B09B10ED64
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0xEEFA8D0B71A0F3295323761DE075B5F0
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x42095686216EEDCB9F9AEBBE4E72E62E
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0x17E782F1380903400C705292129312A9
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x6643C56E3EF381656FE91244C93F7A18
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."

0x5D7442CB709F60B1668F927B5194A827
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x1BEA4D9ACCB1E0A4537B8DAFA1B95C94

furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall

approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x347F6EA37B02FD64ACD6F035606FA7E6
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xA2B6B89FA89B21DF6144E5C19EC5CBD9
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x9B53D6D1CD3AFB0B1364B54B0647F5D6
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for

0x1F80B5DADA3B745B38E3AD5EB58E6AEE
transaction actually took place."

"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a

ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
0x6875A559F3BAD36693582024E07CF730
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
0xA2CF9F8C601A2D219A37A210BBC84431

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not yet."
0x1C59DCD0DF1D9A052BB37F362BFC4A14

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
0xDF3805FD25A9889F43C795B209DC31AB
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
0x27732F04B11C423325F98B80CB440979
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
0x6F7C9B82D2B1A8E2A2356DE581ED16B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
0x73D0A52DFAF2AD1BD1A4D589B64FDB6E
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
0x76445B700B08177CEE923030686A2431
mystery of that awful visitant."
0x3E4B88C6E97E60016E7D1826BBF9E59B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
0x13BF5A9A1E12137A05AB1FF5A29CE035

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xA24F088140F0823C2866AD178CBEB39E
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0xE97D38E55E595A7407A38CB22C9314E4
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x98C7B623F901534DE28A2633F6DD5780
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x4499234F7787E9201C3A141626C25D2C
to bottom in two halves!"
0xD587950571821245437E3815F18C9D54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xC02AE47E3B64A301AE145B7B39A245FD
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x88D9CB031FE2E6BF86DC7E2087B839DB
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x17C22B77DB10D4AB274ADD457A015999
might have happened!"
0xA29AB54AAEE61E9F012CD16BE6345ACC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x47CEBB1A43A61C90AA739245E819FE8F
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x1B169982E5F28F85EA0B476ACD039409

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x09097380828176634AF54DCC997684DD
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x2A56C2EA3F2D6D5D3E7B06E40ED059A2
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x94DCA0625EF0AAB7449E2DA9C27BE0AD
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xF0D0077D29B8A8188C37F1DA61AA86D0
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0x7374885EB11C00EB78D8CBED6FDAE93C
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x5C2A261A10CA0851D40687F591575B62
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0xC70CA8F64D601F35C682713275480D3E
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x098CE64016BF7A7BD5E5D11D98631C4C
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0x0AB5C9A60F0DCDECEFDDA4C725BF190F
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0x895292981206216AD0769C4D9D3052E8
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x2A43DD5928EF213857553CE770567E02
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0xFE63A35AAF8CBE1C84131823CCD48F92
solution of the mystery?"
0xC85ABFAAB6C350C87C2BED5965B24103

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0x821E7F02D48A2E0ED815BB89EA5DF556
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0xFC9CBFBD36A587092B05239756C230F5
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0xAB850FD05D3C433505F59DEEC3CD9F08
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0xD11B80F53225E9E389C69375961A2539

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x4A6E72B9F8B0120583695B40F6828E7D
candle.
0xD290129A75FEF8FDE4F785ED037829F1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x5F07F597C6C711CEB655D7AFE4D89109
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xC0DF6F386FF13D68C5894C7FD17202C3
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x78062D8009C6356880EB55BCF6868D43
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x8D70B79C085BD7C312194CD264D6202E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x61C2D44A4359B2FA63C954DF6DCDD24B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0xD50D2E4384AEB84459FA95787AD0FD4B
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x3C2772C18FFDCC9CBF8A9DA5A53AF21D
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0x2CDA17AD1B49FE951E792DDCFF0A4D1C
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0x1293BC578FD194893354314366D61263
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x9E708DBEED4E0A1907F76A1EE927518A
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0xA644606974E6C14E15CEEB081F388792
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x32E866F80D24780EEFE65C3094BBE7B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0xAF1B5FE43838236EFA6B8AF41EEAA781
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x1A69E839CEDCD7A67429B3C151334705
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x9CA8ED4C0B2FD9B5F0000BF402B801BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x2C4F411F03A5417DD7416A306E6396C1
Janet now?"
0x794A8E79F3CB4687CCAFA4B100187F2E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0xF72ED45A3FFD8CEB9F641938AA02C564

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0x9DD72B99CA6E11561B99AB5FD3138555
love and blissful union."
0xE7698FB4F97DDAF65A7155E23EB41A86

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0xE3D89A2CC75063AB045662D0DECB1B46
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xC2F2390185CDD7E8484980FB382C0B52
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x66C7072208BA7725DFD42451C67A72B2
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x2ED6E00EA2314BA1B938D7D616C9A995
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x0CE4CF85C4B6F854E1BE85F8243CAA56
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xD83E8C7EDAE4C86B0EFEB6750E1C2546
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0xF1CDBA4AAAFD7939B937FF3357875069
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0xF8E4010A2B9B5F32A9C8DFF25B9EFE37
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0xB17C9B7373518AC2624C3CDDBBF7D91A
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xD782C4F089B9A025418C5524B683246F
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
0x88702D5F5F865B1DF11F2707750B784B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0x1615A9C87ABE250F05836A35698AEE2C
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xB87BD3157D76C8E5148A202308C7467A
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x4003D75CB390AF8A30DF92C49D4CEA4D
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0xC4B1622A1005B74906B158983C5BC2C1
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x0BDDC38BCC1EDE1251E8B5FA6EC8152B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x60C8C052761136180B80892393D4BBF7
not taken one peep."
0xBE3460D0A8E5F735C744F4D34DA4AE3C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0x1281123277175BF7754E36A9794219B3
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x6ACC3D583592A1987153F85CEE1BCA78
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0xC1BD1254B0F05338D7EBAA93B3076962
by Mr. Rochester.
0x6726768AF3DA111543C8372669DA38A9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x3F1F7CC7303F476A538CBAE2CD065221
so long!"
0xFD92C03C1646646426BDB5B47F8F4552

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0xF3CBF05AA3B963FE775172E62C099635
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x6A1672B97EACE3A635165C80FBA4126D
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x1412BE94689316517F3BD36EE3DA1886
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x75F0CBF1952F4378754A4E3CFC2F32A2
footman, answered it.
0x005C41568A21617AC60CA3E1FDB80360

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0xCB89F422AE48AE894EBA5D286676E42E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is the luggage brought down?"
0x5026786E92A494FE9096F116B122EF98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They are bringing it down, sir."
0x065A7C7AFA6B41FC456C46851C353D91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
0x9CFF4256ACB8FE3A300733B525D740E2
there: return and tell me."
0x455A6B1234A7CC3E413904CBCDCFB17A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0xF5A1F4EDDA453C210549D847A79DD3A8
footman soon returned.
0x311120EB3FB328ABD1D8478117913AD7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
0x1FA162B79CAC27A2FC40380219C3455A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the carriage?"
0xA3007E80EF4FF40CE424AED06D65D66C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The horses are harnessing."
0xEA787F89B61F1F968DAB8EB29F171A36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
0x21E984434236CB6B3FEA9925405F6CD4
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
0x0BB40B56138E741F9CE4E97AF96CEBF4
coachman in his seat."
0x5A86161AC4FC44FEBE59BD421A4ADC0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x16F19BDA0C4B012AAAC473B6C49E99F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x0900619F33D8C861BAE9165790E7AF54
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0xAFF1F9AF00B2E66A830717EE09888302
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x826DE74F40F0218B4C57E6325931AD36
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x27A80080903FF177467A5CA30AAA34B5
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x9335C691B256888976BAED9DE8EF8E65
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xEDFC2678329588B7494975B0C9DA8D3D
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x4499522A691C880CA2F6E84C95304A6C
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x75F035D36B72C1D58F3AF4F5067271C0
and flashing eyes.
0x001687E835EA38DB3AA349246D1BF8C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0x2F5801958FB89EE42195A6228701C290
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xE9486B4FBBA8C842FA477DB9AC0961E1
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0xF0043290E6F15B69531E2DD5C99BE8DA
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x8E6D27D29791591755397CBBDA4360BB
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0x12F848C3BC27CE24A44A425B486A8C8D
seemed breasting and resisting.
0xD651C9B6CB44E5391417D3FE54305A4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0xB8B0A282E6286E59B4D87A0FA4D40767
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x6980C2FC975E6DD324050A8E9E74DB3B
me, Jane."
0xB5F8FFFEE77700F988D94CA40491F6A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xE257708C99D45DD621C94AA095006243
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0xAC385E723F55CAFEEDA2E4319EE43C7A
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x599E180B97D113F00095003EAD17B393
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0xB31C210CE5628DBF5F8811B81BBAA576
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x72674099AB729AA975A91FB06559F881
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x0E80F1E52F4C76CFF13CB5081097D6F1
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x51D1E5D42DD89C4D0753BCCD44A0AB13
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x6C1155499C76174E368925D793A4601E
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0x06DB838518309175AB3A4F979881F534
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x133781A599456A07C2F4B54F226B5910
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x61B682D2164981C7926A97423903A3A0
path to the porch.
0xB1AE3E5A505D50B75AC62C7DD98573C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0x695095385861B81BE8FCC6C3D9C14E20
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0xEF2BF71D770DDEA8557D7D663E60CC3D
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x2759B279CAB1DE20B404F9AD2E74D9A7
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0xB0BA6B4DFA067807F87CADAF15FF5EDD
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0x59E1ADABA3BF71741FE54FD01ED12B16
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0x64C69BE853C8BE1F657718D80565B742
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x289836C50C553E2B16F00C935C4AD03C
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x81103166C5103E1715A93C6CA8204190

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x7EB40D937FF200AFD453C8773D67ECAE
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x8752558BF3F9C4FE23529155E7296418
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xC70C553A78F476B63ACD6FC58150E8D8
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x597B9CB735A06400EAC0D1A9367DE46C
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x83C450E7DCE0EEB975F72D55DE00DC94
Rochester, went on.
0xB74062624688668C07DA92DA9396DB4F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x70AF8DFA0B946F7914633E83325DDC2D
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0xBCEEB2D2F195D203B7CF32B2A326A1F0
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x7BD920E3A92625A06BF152FA40259D22
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0x9E8B2C4DCF26E756CBD1EB2187A67F9F
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x8C636DD7D47C3E9C2E98EED613D92D23
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0xE09FB276C987F89001062A2E87523838

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xC718B258A84CEAB99088707DBFF453C0
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x9C5DE15E1F51356E0BF97F20485808B9
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0xCCE84B2FD0487557644840E8BBF26844
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x84BBDC6D9CD8EDF2E962A7638AF5DAB5
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xD0B41A1E0B2C9DD358AF764C6FCC28B9
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0x5FB84A2DCAA2BA28D5167FD32C013B4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xB9AC3043C5A49C432025737DCB774620

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x1573924FAD69A421725F869388B4B353
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x0F11059D8AD558A3C8865D9CC542B93D
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0xC2C90B07B994EEE3304693E3EB10E492
said, "Proceed."
0x4F4F74BB3953BE6905594214DD3A905F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0xC1D5AECEF7C1DC2D5F94C337505FD986
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xE7F201DAED975C443162D891F01CA108

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x288055ED088D2A43246A4A77078659DE
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0xAB8A8BC7B1793038297CDFF2D77B58E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x156326C002F61F3D679C4085D965251D
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x84B59824792607BDD3E4BD74C73872B5
marriage exists."
0x8CFB893C67B45EC6D935011EC130B564

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0xD6176E15C9B2E549D609CBD3695F54D7
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0xED6E82B0F8982C3D108EF9E45CEC54FC
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x671ED622B791959D406F595BEBF4A092
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x23C11249B9C1ECB4C8A195A1CB37B63C
beneath!
0xA79A568F7A71F973E2239C26B0DFBCF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x1A45C9E7362A5F1B3B23F86CED75BC55
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x3CD28DA2EBC6FC2CADAF21F38D7C49B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x3E58DA00195CE2B4CC216DF33EA56611
advisedly."
0x77A9238B5BD735D0E047368673C189A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0xE6743303B56090A5480EDC345435271F
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0xE45AE13467B07D8A3EF9CB5CEEF86B8E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0x3EBDE7980C00475151D23E4931BFBB2F
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x1E014248777D5481C18E6574D738FB51

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0x51667960C55FA490F17CD7D6E0FD1CA3
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0x07051122166D647E2166B77342AF451F
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xF0F4D5FE587546DFD36973B2F31D3144
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0xFD58ACBF6C9F9FE7F59B509D4C9F296F
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x6D2E42EF3AA5B801C41D5BAD31E49A5B
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xE967530284A6E32B7A2B21A49DA18D55
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x85B8A716CF18803741DC45BB6BE15835
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x9480D00EC6421B284C1DE61762873F09

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xBB1302C66FBD34DDAF1EF111C1119B07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0x753142B4687C99A0A9F52F8F42220B1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x5A537A72D0F09AB12394EE65AF5DB230

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0xEC228DE04BDB253E0A37E9404E2097A7
recognises, if you do not."
0x1544AA392370EF0F0EF086125284D605

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x1C990B35B7F7CEEAAC37964F3A426A72
place of abode."
0x42EE108736E28FAE41385AC17C3BD610

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xD29ED2A4812BB8CEC83FDF942BB07B94
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0xC9E80F9A42F8132EB3D47BE9318FD7F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0xB6B097C6EAA469128BD30A4FFEE5A2CB

0x938F915856264CAA3FA060216B29CD9F
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0x9534DF051FB7B01677F72DB1B1087053

Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of

0x610AA6ADB72A78D206C156B73F86F0EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x6A86E39264341C9B9F2A6BDBD78D6876
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x250C0F87D4DCCE7EC7F74DDF72F57159

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x5C45FB1232E82318B9DCDB50D4727F19

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How do you know?"
0x384A7F18500D44C095A08545CCB7E4A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x850BC1C19D0054C7859BBE43D7161EFE
scarcely controvert."
0x07A1C6733E6A4C3E787CC8D755A5B013

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x43AC0D4B555FDBA47CC3F02ABEA68D13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0x60045127DCF1254E2862E84DFC6991F6
goodness to step forward."
0xE48D27867FB07C21D37379F939443EB6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x5F117640F3A485024644E11A47766E98
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0x65B2A9E58BE4A46D861EDD1CB25B51C8
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x16598958F7F5184DA75B9D8A6C16C7BE
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0xD682E74C6A5DE0545E8F01053583B677
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x67DFA5BAA73FEB99FBD6F0E2462C4261
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0xC0F6E27E27EF9C8E4DA018B014BB9DFC
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0xE48295FFA2D6F8AC22C4887F363C0EF7
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0xE8881D4B9322B7F6B06A7C42C0BD9ACB
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0xF047DB531087982AAD98964DECB163A8
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0xEA8F2C206F03A917604145EBDF09E35B
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x72175FA8962D9A0D35F6917D682DD78E
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0xADA5BCD97358CA97180038595CE09C5B
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x2AB865712F3A9511D8AB0062381BB8B5
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xAD24360C149FFCAF7F42D0E8D9EFC4F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0x128463719F6EAD82F1DC306452753813

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x297E067347553109BEE505208876E3E8
what have you to say?"
0x087E69F5DDBD1E36F1A507246F474CAB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x9D58BF0556776D139660FA7E310C9986
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x5BB93648006D97D5A635E2D3C25F8C25
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x9179922A53E59444E28C9B0F8FD637FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x594F98598819E16339816E7013A06C13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x71A2ECAA7720B6DB4E29803756ED4D03
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x9114C0B23EFFB8BAEA5123A42CD0F781

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x2345238F8BB44EFDBBCEFDEFF23BA3F2
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0xDA0F82606484EB2B24FCD86CE862B089
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x04F599292D2A9A0B532CC52BC521A5A6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0xCCA708E555132359B6C6A3DF4CF04EE5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x5AA1BA33D463987DF3D6499BC2C80318
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x5A89CCABEE552D38C6AFE8E20F182C4F
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x2D4FBF81EF5CEF97A30CD4D889AAE600

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0x7DA75DBBE649C9BA25FD7D8BC70689F7
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x84423F68275645824B4C4D4CB42F9831
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x0F332F3872F0E586D4653741B84FFA59
obeyed.
0xBFC004ACEB51DA8251AC5DC4B5F04691

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0xB1FC58AE4A4E4EAD9DC531B3C1031722
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x237D7D3914C4E6CEE7F233E002B8495D
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0xC1614A6EB2066800F0FD0E9846564F27
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0xC14A747D87DFE26257652AF9C73911E9
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0x55778D7495564CF1D59A7A1291E0EDFC
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0xE554AB05AB7155A4C3C1BA8789017ED4
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x2F495263E60B4266335972E5D137B561
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0xD5F9785743CD6450B5AFDD85AAC87C42
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x9685508EC63B199FF4CE625922D329D2
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x3D210A4968E4366042EE04678EBA0A25
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x16FFED678DA9E8872F2EF26AB3948FA7
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0x3171691A6076F58F93452A9555180E7B
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0x6F5E68DD1B00B69E73FEB7911A1EFBF6
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x1B677948F20171D29290418D629CB179
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0xF4CC81748EDF769E119E33002C7A038B
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x19694D4F2B9C8012262D3431840628EB
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x838A843CE13E624DB9E7215CEA6322BB
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x539603CA5E36D508B6FF8DD3C9469230
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0x0A90CD13BC2FB98FF3AFB55B27F9F798
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x9A6410F7D07C8AA5766E54DC21B707C2
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xA6E1D21CE120ED0D2829A8D85DC025D5
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0xB4951D1B07857D763D7269A26C06D3E5
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0xE3568CC3A85985848751A4206FFC0F4A
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0xAED9FE9AC8CC4003CD15616A35D7AF51
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0xCEA43A939C8D013B033FE33C7C408CE7
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xCFCCB75FCF3E660B22DB17FE8D42EC62
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0xECB5C7B578C083D6EC041B29C57CF2C0
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x1B317F123C42D0AFC99B2CD8BD2C75B8
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x831B3352CE3119E1E893CCE96752D6BD
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x87412508FC9D886ACA6F05C7905931C7
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x0C613ECC7F60E51C7F2BCF6EF2E83429
you--follow!"
0xFB427CDD9E1B546DF158E7B640E6EC2E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0xEC8740C3E759212DCE10226083787657
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x961BC0A2632510139829DA74D505EBD3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x93566370C81260FE195F9E821EEEDD32
will not be wanted to-day."
0x6842289C9C8AEF8C7ABD6D77869D80FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x88A7893B7C77F5915AEB29B9768BCEF3
greet us.
0xF122BD4A5C46F8B3EF68BCC65916681F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x740FC1AD441CEC0029CDE251C3AC0204
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xB62C59D2F19CFAAA0C9857AFF3953A9E
late!"
0x2CCD2DA3D2B4529492D92303E5481D8F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0xB88B17B44C4C744B53473AB52DF010EF
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0xDE85FF06836CDB8E5E3145CB23AFC957
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0xDA345381BE44539399A1BED7022ECD4D
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0x6D49D88B78BF4BFF9CD8AD506343E538
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xE884123D40B54D3CAD610A9649C80918

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xDB2530876738E609A6C614058839E972
here."
0x89C3C4D6F0BFDC5A352ED80AC7041020

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x455FB0944D84D653A5F7D60D0220592D
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0x40C9429EAB725741FCC8F9D99E199E0D
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0xEB467BC70D40EB74F93335E97A47DA25
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0xF48416C134753E175A93DA1D90CDA5B4
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0xF4836BBD3CF569FB411FA9CBF83A3F8D
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x7FC08B06F2C847B01B73CAABBC7A3260
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x3A53C2AE873204977ABDA394408C9ED7
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0xF5D3C1B490CB2FC28B6D12DB0E2CAABD
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0xD3FCEC9CD8F957B61AEFEE499BB36750
mane, hid its head and face.
0x438FFCF07471F5BF78669F88B93CC767

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x1807764ECAAABFE63583B32AA87D5ACB
your charge to-day?"
0xCD5294A7BA044ED36731BEB664C51207

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x0B720980F673B688BF1E0242E0037AB3
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x5AD08DD4B425EB406356C276739F546C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x956E8D14C8421508B61DAA57487B686E
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x4D27A1CD4B82EC4DFB003FB2587E6ACC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x4BEF4F5B48DE28435FBB8F168E431FEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0xE51A5F7A7E92C23FE96672B7359A990F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0xC34A3212AE80D1858DD437C16D907678

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0xFD5AAAC188DD9BFECF0C697BE05754CB
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0xB9F9FC85A49B93360D286C10944F6084
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x7B8A20E6CFB000E9DF115D3E3ABCD888

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0x4CE63F70DB241C73AB2204971B03CA19
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x3A448ED6AA926198870B4D76596E3B6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x0765E2D39856968046BADF8A46B9169C
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0x016A6798856F428CCE133DF63D754E49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0xE7F8D4A2AC8DE8E4F273D232C09337B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x2729E61600C27AAA59D6585CA3767638

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0xD848EFD87CA3403692FF2997B01F9A8D
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x20ED82C75AB4898E29790CDAA7021B47
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0x836374DF7C020EBA78E3DA120561DD69
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xC448D743B5588E7C7704CB2F2B62B45E
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x9F4CE186786EA063C1FCDEB28B7A76C3
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0x81CF21E851BF35C5268035AC566CA721
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x228D1D7C963951BF86B40717AD6E914F
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0x7856649D1CBFE6FD6790AE0E7FC00BF7
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0xB45778DA07ED5EDC0E4506805F6AC871
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0x1299627A15B0F79E79B258BE935833CC
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x12416E6CA2050061685A3BA4AE9CD2BF
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x14A3B7E42C23B6F365B5F9BD0488B7AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x7270FECB340B0CE9DB5DB5CBAC3A65C2
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x8086FA09B50A8A272309A862D0CF2A71
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0xB305201628E0B2BDD1C89C1C59225939
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x99BE8993988963757CBA6A6328FA5009
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x87A9DC5BF0B003D4F0854CDB652DAC88
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0x902159BD732D4CA0B3954F7C7AD293B9
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0xE51D7AA6F9C0EF6149BBDA78CB8FAD2D
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x62B5D6AA55039867BB058866D18F0E05
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x2314D9C0FF1E0A002FE6715288FBAB71
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x4C66FAEC6F752C3E51C2A9D7DCC269BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0x926F02C8DD0014202660C8B2D112AEAC
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0xE9F8085A1909914742274A6DDA145D38
the stair.
0x058740FE0D7028318F9BA5F4EE7E1BDC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x4950D00C6C7E5CDDEA518B525D265248
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x2386F6C3DE6A9303E01CB7DF6489C85D
returns to Madeira."
0x24438F3616CF3F4C2DD755BB7F1B07B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x789E5202F8BB549ED4CA7FCEF5ACE705

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0x249A453B3553347213D2FCA64B376BCC
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0x8050717C99CE46372DBF25F716AD8B42
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x943A48BBA4FFEFEBC12DABDBA89A1A84
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x58C8A6359BF1DB8D24E1C4DBF6FCF225
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xA57A215034AF684BDA1E2DACBB7836DC
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x28F7CFB817C071682F8313F3AA44120C
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x47C2E303231BB9AE61DB45737D52F8B2
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0xDADA306223D243F5DCDD895882D14299
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x543960BB705BA56081A2A8380255C96B
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0x06DFBA4D05EA3A28EC2F9EA611352A28
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x9980416076ADCF77E98F4629AEA2FF8F
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x71837826C4E8EC0D83DE2287D28CD9BE
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x80341E91B26332B19A904ED876DB228B
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x79F9A6B7D7FBF060158FE9040D2350BD
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x469D03B5A650D7CDCCD218397159003E
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x60CA8F5F68120462367BA603D2DDA0D3
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0xFA1771DD304783E36516EFC9F2D981DF
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x57786029E16614FC035DFF10F2C56222
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xF595B12C2BBE479DA209B97D25580FF0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0x9F062F693D690152189AED9C7B3D1A99
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0xDA4AB313111DE76E3E266EB529A18D83
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xD3629C6B3435535ED2745F9AF76DC48C
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x3817059211FBBFF02273240493672F03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x50AD8E5FB665D0FC662BFA4AD9543705
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x0D7CD6A6964309999CD39F81348E18DB
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0x8DF99B635A67F5D08940146B7C17B3DE
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xB7C81BA73A12360A27EA884013BF05EB
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x12A9911550626D4A8924BD3D4A1799BC
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0xB0629ED1721FA9DD8F4116AF7FCB46AA
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0xA94B8F9B53322C8794D588FBBE88A693
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0x57672508AB2CADCA2F5B20644CE40145
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0x844643DAE3AE171813DACE4B4DB96F06
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0x134555129D756C4AFF19B99B11B6870C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0x58FACE4C5B74C0C2B72CFE0B950939FE
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0xBA637A484EACF89337C470846A24D1CB
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xF1B7F4614C1E32ED155C5F628B7047BA
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x1A41A3F09178B53EA05A66E7CF6F24B6
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x07C27E8A1A2821C1BF1084E4755BEEB7
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0x33F79276D4608ACF37FC76BC0CAA7BFF
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x4B03839401D9788F1412A51D9CF30D49
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0xD61E8146831C69E051BD9C09845AA9D9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0xEA1C9D6124BE0A99F326415E01FC8C88
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x6CEDF450B1427C9B22269BFB0DE49C65
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0x39D82B4A72122FF1F676375949141314
prospects?
0x72BCB1B75064FB4E067F28F99136F3D8

Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x49ECEC570756501B18DCEC27ABA29AE4
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0xCEF429A1817DC838D42574C55F731EFF
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0xBFD09A70B35DFED10438B2D7AC5BF4AA
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0x2C8559123CA5823CB68D36B834742DA1
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x18C9300AE77503D0C165194E3AEC2DFE
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0xC94FA101D21D4CC83426ACC247C64DC1
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0x021906B3B57D9CB6F81EB520F63F82A6
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0x7717E1F5B31FA433D6F36284837D291F
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0x23F2564F980C2664BD3C0FCCBFA55398
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x01EB3DC3BAC9B221D4116BBEED1FEA71
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x3637A4B16363F1EA9BD3EEE7B0E5DE13
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x9483347F15176A502513949BDB5EEA5A
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0x79B4AF20CEA3E38449BF5FCD1DDA8288
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0xC2A968B3A29766D5913275F4A73C8CDB
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0xEDA9A29865D5327DA43AB1513465B6D6
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x6248D05FD036D0B1BCD01E6C844A864B
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0xA3A40F5E50B384189A4A73A1F35AE638
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0xF8217984DA1E5CA55BFDECA9346BE31F
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x48083CFC802EB061EA97970EDEC22544
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x51A8F36C1325F305180F5ADE85864C10
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0xF29311813B5C0A6C492C73CCFB31833E
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0xFF07F1BB735A35573A373E0DDFD63061
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0xC626219E152C081AC1A303748A5B8C2F
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0x02A69CBCC1F35AC968ADBFAA4E71F4F1
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x8F6D2266634B76E9060E8FFE72CFA752
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x67E7626D1BE03A2E209B56CF26971911
conduct!
0x5123EDB7FC76696A81D2542E823FA033

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0xA278CD3A0DA64D7A6B6641A97239AE06
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x7E6B1E6C52EE67E01B8D0C8036FAA725
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0xEA917F06BE445617A5DC4E6B38A8529D
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0xFF46AAA67D737E8AF55F789194DF58D6
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x60011F6385C7DE48C1B2B2D97AE46561
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xDF75955D0AEA631729595A0C80B86480
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0xA0FEDA45C1426D9FFF17C604A6A0E26A
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0xC76ED8FBF7DFB0002DE6BE53D38AAECA
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x5A9A91346EB313CB7C2DE10E9C71B107

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0xCD090C28FA0BBEE8F59A0565E37CF3DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x35533AE64BF8C45ECD13EDB0B10E9CF1
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x533E377336609B548699971E1C11E2E8
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0xC2B8E6D82A47C3BC3E614D3CCA0F2FE8
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x6D1D82F6BF68DA9BEE6833B9210EDF21
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0xDBE8AB656D7F2E553915B25CA8762A45
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x02CDDA9EAC8FC055537FE098B11ABF1D
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x644ACAFE10697825D0849772C31B3D3D
floods overflowed me."

CHAPTER XXVII
0xC27DBB1096BB5D8270E30BCA83FCD746

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x7C94F630F356BD1BB849D10B92B038AC
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0xFBFA0A2BEB06E64AC284BD507C7C600A
"What am I to do?"
0xBE54DA266C40E95CBFA0188320737833

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xBB071696CB9CE2E9F30016D50F353996
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x502DE4CECDC23337E2EAAB6A74F8A395
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x955F9AA03ABD1E54983F3482C7AA8469
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x35E00ACDBB536431B3E5587C21EFBE86
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0xE7997B61A67E5D62C403AFAFF34B668F
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x6DF573096D818B1B957A780AE801FA72
cannot do it."
0xCAA0452AF3770D645524ECD832717043

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0xAA5BFEFC78F23A5B9F63121225153833
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0xE331A0DAA139A8D9DF1FC10BF0548256
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0x45DCF37A008F357F3DF847DB543B4C7A
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0xB2FB92EA3745E7F4DD69DD0CFD7895C8
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0xC5F801065134A82A2DD2DC1953CFA3E6
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0xD2F007B86403800EAD944C10935B1DC4
depths of agony.
0x0B66A44C909DA6C45D44D7E05AF250D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0xB3E80B05E9FF4F09BD92A00441471529

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0xF0AC81C26990F69A5106AE1AEBCAF839
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0xE14D6348362271651BA75FAE6EC361BB
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x560DD5E5B023B6E6D7C6CDFD9B4CA62F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x0BEBB76A8FF9492AEC55465806649573
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0xA31218EE07B6B3F4A0C7A4D3076A383D
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0xD24E1D9BBBC3A2009EE8424C87EDD3AD
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0xF8562FB5D4BDDB31883B6D642B90888B
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x2D1767D828EFDAD3127DB9AF4A89481F
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x336ED24426E100F7844B5CAC4F4FF7AE
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0xBDCE5FDBC4FDEE93F3B2FD8DF2868273
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x0496B1D82E5125148AC89C098AB000AA
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x3AEF56790549A0D65990E296F143B7A2
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x99F15BB92484C9B9B1AB519AB1A6B530
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x3545D9A3CC8A4DB22DA61B1B02701C0B
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xE0D8230241B4FD69CE87CDF840778077
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xC47BC47BB6A7437F09C038055D8222BC
threshold.
0x93AD919B408D40B555E6F031B1BB7F65

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x4B44F68CE4397865B0CFFC330692D410
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0x06700A922CA495B09F2C686A6E747597
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0xA805836D32C872BF704CC7CDB343008A
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xD8D0E3C79B6405AA07D9D6D7B7FE40FB
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0xA64F915ABC8D2344C1451AE4488284BC
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x59A5362551B5ACDDADBA095230620648
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x1F55EB7D54FA8EDE0CE6F47D4993B950
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x74B2D7FB3E7F47171F1BF35CB232DFED
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x2E30F8C9E7475B2A24112D517BAA00C0
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0xC4BE0EC643084E15C166AEA9794388A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x94CE4B34EAF7B0E14F5829B9ED2A4B06
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x2A18064162867EDC5E110A14CAF7D382
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0xF747B2D81BEC9B2A61E6B104DA8C6076

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x0B631F9E49980240D03B6149FA779872
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0xCF7BABDF2933B22A00BDC6D4C2F01F87
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x31D0C2B91B5762CF613186FC73B7ED72
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xABE9863EC33D0E94DB999E58ECD43228
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0xF34159EDC39C4EA5904B95BA190DD5F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0xF3966BCB01215E20327F442A92EDEF46
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x010CF6664624E6C319FB5BE5390F6BF7
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0xF3211C687C1B14FDC502098AA6C609E7
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xE90DD45E91B3DD548F2B5F31A222B75F
heart's core.
0x91B0EB04A6D1559AF537086839DC5384

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0xDCFDD3E3745E3DC154841D8DCC93CFCC
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x0C08663922028AF7DDA577E18B0064E6
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xB583103D378FA865A5599EC018071D7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, sir."
0x70EC952057EE4175898D2754338B81AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xF43B2B725BB10333470806871D1865BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0x1BE57F0910CB7649201DF52F9DE31E1F
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x2515CA3D5D5CAEBD6C6828605FDD6C35
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0x8A2EBFE30E36EB4CDD912A3F4C464CD5
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0xC612DF9D4DC4FF556A282F902B6BD8F6
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x8D22F615B57314B220DDB4CEE8DFCA20
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x414D757FBFB8CEACA6739CE6DE580EA2
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x58004969E10A0E30687062D6F3C7C13E
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x0A63ADB82F1F43824112F21D4CF78148
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x9B708AA5B373E66A3C42B0866D6B1700
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x5D1E5CEECB82A131A7133B919E49B40E
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0xDA1792079C4095FA0F16DE2D51529603
him."
0x6D9A5291301E528B2D3933C47727F230

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How are you now, Jane?"
0xCCB00BDB9B15555F4A5F9CF3C20DD313

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x4CF37D47ADF016E4B0D43119029F2252

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x459EE0CEFDD7F1C00833390E1A006E9A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0xD6828E6AEBCACDC95F8187C6ABCA0DD1
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xBA0A077EFB528CEF61A792096D9DA220
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x126841D44B17ED2C4A4876B7DBF35A03
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x1215A759D5E990A5C1FB64D0CE223D61
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xD40C49A73F29C5FEE2CB3CC00D310C0E
put his aside.
0x8D2418BEF59158AB8ADC9479644189C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x6B26DF556CDD3C9F5562DA77BC76EE07
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x3AE00768FA617FDA54E62DF65252E89D
appropriated?"
0x3FA8513D607256E3CC402C8381FE3FDA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x5ABF563F7E17058C07FF8C7FFAFAB836

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0x452DD4C8330C5E8E6B6BE72C582161D2
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x7F592505B7C6EDFC712C15FA276C0BB8
rightly?"
0x9BA5D71F2771B97F4AD99900883449B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x09B6AB0E826B1899CB86F0BBB404970F
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating

disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xE3FE1CE6C906907DC4B1BB95287C797C
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x02A291FED71F6192F3C07E125D7EC463
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0x19DAAA53CCE8851BD66D011B6F53F7F6
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x802ADC0C1D4CCEBF3092E6B30EDAA5CE
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x60D40DD9D7A60811E23DE93567151C8A
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x1EF119C690A5A124B2B4998E71860276
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0xD99729B3832D6BD423F70F4A3464738E
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x3F7BA61E7F76AED1774DCD5CB0BF43ED
know you--I am on my guard."
0x34F39DD30C54A31A36BD8133D7F5F20D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x2F10E94003AB6DFE3916672165A861FE
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xD46920E96379AA272F596CA750CD6B72

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x41DD22FA55B590F883BF9004BD206F2A
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0x1D066D6481DB5342326A7E070C98F6D7
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0x57B7506515D52908D55E64F0ACF0E1D1
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x22E118E0B045E686962905D47329B9CE
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0xD882ED0DA05B2EE8A5F0ED904B754393
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x01855972A94602B764B91BBAF64E68B3
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0xC31C1680829C40DB8A088A14C002AA04
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x7DC49918B76936B6066625AA801A0008

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x6EC2123C76C40E3088F8D17D52AD3338
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0xF07B9E6CAC2385341867075993F035F0
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x513C671A7C12CA5FB1098FCD563DF9FF
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x4A76A92AC667543754F0F64D687EA632

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0xEC21C75F84694F30C95D636F3841B22C
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0x50078AC536C5B36EB24C542E3A7686E3
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x3E88DBF58D301B6A09BA28441E26063C
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0xCA1D281A17D1A2449EA25E361F2E37C7
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0x0611B896660E66A38DC265B162A26FED
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xE4BDFCA7FFB58203BA4CACC3C0F2D8A3
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x847E6CCDD5F472A19175B89F03455E32
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0xCC0ECCB39D0AAA7F3E1F4BEDB77B406D
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0x0C2C772E2B731F2B9AEA73D7B8C63458
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xC63B51FE1EF9F5B59CDB88B4A4884F3B
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0xC194B1A527D8D565264EFEF44769322B
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x843538DE012D669C38C51C7B30EC938C
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x2F006E0AF737D90C19652F490A330D61
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x03558E6D2C1DA7B728840FC511CF749E
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x01BE466B789B349E75F15A547AA09230
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xA00E3E73E9AF56AA192B8AB0F67446A2
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0xE4A8D59CFE4BCA73A4A668D4E3DB0FA9
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0x6371A3675E4989A18B6A013A4452B1CF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xFF5CB626A0DCB6B518F71C1D7DCC1AE9
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0xF3D5696F6FAF3AD8C1851ACADD06C6F9
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x324B05A718824FA5FE985F71E4AE2ADA
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0x6C5384B48048EEF4A9E4B8A2601A3038
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x004925C35C4757B76BE22F62293CB3FB
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x35BED83E913B510A41B56104EEF6EBCC
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x441DD080D529E8A5BA0D8FEF2ADEC9A0
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0xAD989D0AA09B7D6267B336FEFA78CC38
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x6753078413EF85ACABE42DD279AC7961
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0xB29006CCB35EC32360AB1BD4AA55D885

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0x66282561CB22535EA936F48A0456E604
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xEC11F6A52248157C8667EA80DA114646
cannot help being mad."
0x10D51F6754881CD0631A9C5C4A20F8C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x7F574C44190533464BE85FD31BC3D761
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x7671A13F212F2D9A6233C2D727F78CD6
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0xE7539F9F3EC02A69FFECE52FDC0B9571

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do indeed, sir."
0x4A9DE4DE1E56941ECD3DA844D5F78A78

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xBF80489C009112CEC4DD432D363F16A6
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0xDF396D02E6E379365B0AB8C5B72A0058
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0xE9266A4AD354F09C8FCABF1EE86B42DC
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x7FDC670DBB8E930EC65984FDEDBA6C11
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0xE9728326BC82FF52CF49C367CC76A523
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0xB5313CB5F320ED1FAF331A22E4727120
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xE91222E426962E5F0F96CB76D2DB1533
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xBAC51D591FEC3EDE65DCEF9AF72E0DBF
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0xAE30B096FF765D35E07DA43D2FABB486
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0xA0B91049AB13A81AF57BF6FCA94B1DB4
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x9642B9EED8AD8D1374393D0F60B2C68C
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0xF8684D97E0D802B2B58F4F2442522FB7
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x9AE43E675359F6ECA766F07B639FD91F
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x020565C614CCB5D357D978A3B0C56155
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0xF47E07AAE169C3E883F7134F569510BF
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0xBA90133FC99648D8BD0D5D086A1F8AB9
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x6A532FFB05CF22DF1B120FEC028B5A96
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x49E9E509397C2CB0BD74A34DF4D4415E
falsehood and slander."
0xCCACE8E5145721BB8CE87CC4D9D0089E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xC9E83BA245C386CC5F06FE5651EC2CAF
for you."
0x789CD5D6CE73A16F0DC44DC16C42666C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0xF7F2CF35925BE9BA6EDAE1B788876D34
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0xA901E2CABBFE95552C04C3D40F2164B2
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0x77EDAC0730ED3EE6E26288F5458F3848
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xBC417F8226EE325C65F969CBBE28B308

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x3CF2FE2F28282C993EB7455B89C7BC66
too dull for you."
0x480E545093B42E6BB32FD2E84B08EAAE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xA7A5CEC892F26F987FC7A96F7BEA7FAF
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x3477F38456EF5E1D715781BE33F249CD
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0xB17D87F21079CB0CDA51C5BA8193FA02

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x67EB3BE7336709F4F289626CFEA52DD9
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xE10892C80279A0C062893526E9B3CBC3
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xF7F48ED291263D9611D682A4B8DAF6C3
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0xF7FF97070ABF47DDF72C6F92C5FDE0D4
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xF63BA50C82B4AB45DA05A13ABC109AFB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x3FC8E503DC7540104A831FFB9D339E6F
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0xF6A67E2F5B6E40B52C8CDCD982A4EBB7
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x9750CB9D775A6726FB37D3D2E7F58EB7
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xDC7418E2458631A049E0515EB0B44798
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0xAA4A5DDC54EC6551D388422F4B5D7E3B
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0x581AA191B9C0CCE8F8C4CC2865802C43

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x1B74ED5971F76940D7B0B570F817A54D
before me.
0x4B08606A538F71338A143AFE036B572A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xE94BFA3BD84003A1F098BE258C960E62
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x86ED02C096D44A2BD0DBECE6ABF653D6
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x29C4C05D0B52A29040DEC1D6D4B61D90
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0xC20C1711D4900FA95E0651C6E70823F2
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xE60ED785514D891633458792D49FBB65
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xE3B0309B05CF7D2F4C0CC96B2B7E8B45
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0x8B972359F47D2EABA97E683EB9522183
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0xF57EACB5AA2768DD3387F4613E95DD1C
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0xA06133C62464F8A7C999A1757230069E
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0xCFB8DD570A72D2839320C524B7CBB59E
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x7AFEF54B36B9EEBBD7B4042B8C7785F6
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0xCE4B67955F154CBC1DEE4C29E8E903A0
soothingly--
0xF17C6EA326F1B5BC7533AEA781211D61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x808FB89BB709F656A54116438E9AB816
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x265109FE6F9053CA2445BDD6A97C889B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x97C3767AE49EC192302659003F817CD9
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0xD3F98CBD79DD8E0E51F830A81DF0A377
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x4D3B43B6C5833C241691683D1EE6630E
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0xBE60163AC38D9D47A886B36BA6916EDD
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0xA80AE72461A0A7688DBF8B7211FB83E7
heartily.
0x8DC45C82EA6D10BFBB2825DF8B91C345

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x056F5BDD608BF8016A95BAB42F8B3249
not while he was in such a passion.
0xCFFFBE0CFA6A9FBAF3D5474A5872F494

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x2D85EA7EF2A84642F23F11CDFEC237D5
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x57E795F0838CA26BE649EC33C9EA12FB
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x99B0F77A1EC05CC67B5C19FC0D206885

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x76DEF80DA2D38CD53457847786659B77
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xACDD8317A35A584B54B6C12BACEC5F17
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0xB95F794B609BBCF41B09C11F5606E064

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0x74F374E192AD81049DCB0D2F92F6B2FD
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x22A3B10B1ACD21C1881AB16EC9476C76
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0x6B93ADA6B8AD925F76BE77A89F6AE5BA
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x84721B9DDCD7A8A3F870CD881F29245F
were some toad or ape."
0x658DCFCCA20827F60A9C84351A20B4E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0xB0AC01D7801B69554FADF48A4DAF6518
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x09C9D3771DE408136366704079504AFB
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x92375201C93E2D3D7EE04081ECDD8F8F
where I had wounded.
0x19268E32317C3C32CBF0476D0EE3A227

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x785433E6A13FFA338FAD90FA4D5FAAA7
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x25C5E34BFE5D9CD3397A45E59DA9A211

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see

You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep

only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in

the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the

innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make

you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be

0xC43293836DF5CB72DD8BF83C0C5AA195
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x362702C160F5DFA061F9381B411AD6A5
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x4D98BA26417954B757AE773F69530E27
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher

you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the

"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x5DA152D28765795ADA32AB6FC60052B6
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x67C2EA78706CF3499CE740329EBE420E
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0x02D59C9047A138AEDEFB7E9C72143C5E
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x1CCFCFAE15641FEDD52077AAC626AF2D
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x44C8B66B321618227382B7E53CAA3F24
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x223BCF7E8BA4A6398B773CA719E049BB
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0xA96246491600F5BD47BCB369658BE5C2
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0xF76BAA03CF5C85C8ABD0A3F78495CF63
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x6547909FA1E5E4AB3B19E7297B879449
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0x7DBA64F29CBF72F1ACF99674B5AD6DED
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x9034EFED1297F168C7A26447B2FB8CC9
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0x2B9F3FBB8BC033BD0BEE0B5A277B7A55
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x3F5025CB8AB76344C4C31EE1B098C5BA
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x006DA9774E4711A51182E672AC539BFB
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x290878238034ABBD294F79A79C32F6E1
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xE9F8F5ED3A9CED44646466E668C20E45
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x1364D2BC5D3964BE2FF0C7BE01732442
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xBB897A52F7518A7A553F82C01DC1C443
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x684A17329D796EBC14E42EA214323B35
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x38811FC5D08A7D398745476D1303A09B
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x25D2A92F13177FF5B0F96104033ACBC7
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x278238ADCB6C87DC82BD9A5F7E85B2C4
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0x001D7E56DF721F90AD92436D71402E21
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x8FBD0E739C983209F38FAA39F544FFCF
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x1C2AA8FE91D9A3F66796036535D7A8B2
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x1DB6E44DD78EBE821D850DA0DB1BF976
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x8AD7F2E7200A4F704507D330107F9288
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0xBD80488F2AFF549E5EFC0DEACE82453D
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x48F904BDE6C49A7B5EEF062630A568D7
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x6E6693828F97A0FD2C5EC9A724AA0C4D
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0xE0AF25771A23CD17218811CC6097A4DB
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."

The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor

all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble

mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x3CE2F8462EBE0FD9B0ED4FCC5D3DD112
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0x6F73AC2A71594FC3B780BACE16674C05
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x0863B93E6901DC6BDE2DD94A9AE5CFE7

shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0x846B85563408625DD2D69D2183BC9AE9
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x31461D8F649B542F0E4423F95DE6D3A5
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0xBB275F4DF0BFE3B072CDCC3BD27BD2F9
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x2B1AB2C2F643A2B192D360C258569160
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant

propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on

which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer

it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is

all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I

0x948D786E4C7A226DFD6A9F782BB7562D
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x7307882703720FAB48062C88FFA703C1
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x26DC9AE8AA8E28139C0B1516E446F5BD
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0x5D33522CDAC2664EEAC95963144035A2
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x4715D275B80593B2646C70ABF72A8AA1
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x3E17FF5B56DA0709D1FC6A3228E86619
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x661B62E463CBAAD2A1F74A30DEEF5215
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0x55665ECF1F82361C52ACDB3DF86A3022
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0x88A420B5387715C9582472600BD34312
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xEC387097C182F7DDA805351FAF17AF2E
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x8A819C242446A734F4CCF3FB41FB89D2
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0x3A838C08A417766DE919B7C487C97425
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xA7DEB8BE85B504A8B0C6BB9655F44D1C
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0x4E4F93C40DFEA6396F24ED13F08CDC97
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0x7B0D4691E7BA668CC99CDD17C2CB91D0
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x96DEE3B43AE37EB15AD9D0ADA4FA0CA0
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x6DFC9BE27D575B2A65ACE8FDEE0DF872
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0x7F47CD8A0B40FC568872D8C7827E87D4
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xE468B5F07C4C2BFC7BF2AB610A7E9084
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0xF242E8D28FBC15830F3E7FAF8F0ED4F7
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x9DE339A0E309FA1B80A35ED38593ED24
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the

sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0x21D3768E3BAAE2F773F87F32463DA427
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0x7B9BE20241567C86A5DA252F9591FED1
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
0xCCCA16589D06D9578818B2224B7A7A9D
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
0x80FC6067ED5BAF731B1130DC846D7938
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'

a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained

the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
0x9F7162965DF6F08E6DC4FD54999B1A17
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
0xD7410FC013ED210228DB35CAD3602EEF

0x8E5C7A9DF27772F850AF43F5A51B58D1
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the

dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched

pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
0x828496EBD5CF9C5764717076E2067E0B
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true

Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to

"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,

and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
0x931B929342D47BB1C0C8657177C0725E
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
0xC170C68AA6F0A91A97785539581C145A
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
0x6F580647B43BE72029879C6080381CF6
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
0xA715416B841D234B502D7A73BC45F491
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
0x95F30B6D839A6027E230D4E5ABEFE1E3

take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and

precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,

and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-

suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted

cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
0xA6EA19695563A1835E072EF360BBF7A9
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
0x7BC87FF1A6E6B520D8EDB67EDEFC685C
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
0xFF5D980E57283698AE48341EE603C2E3

"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
0xD1E70B205170F99E1516F6B308A28B9A
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0x49CCB9D828D34062864E375B3351FFFD
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
0x3DA55EE4AA3437A7F1487A33CC8B1464
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
0xFBB51BF0A28A7CFB12559F95DE7EA3C2
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x58C7C6F227B98DD1187CE7EF13D0663F
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x2EF26006A91A5315DCFBBE9931E4BB87
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0xBB8EBE00AD903277B403EF81E56DB5AC
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0x6DF782E444A2EACF988D162D5646E802
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
0x82A85A44670CA4ED2C8CAF5FF11F9E5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0xC7336B4805D642D53D50D06A345DBB74
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0x17FC7CBB9361FDA54D6D5C5D12644C89
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0xCE13E8990561235A71E622E1CB072825
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0xCE72DAB2A68E3210242915796981A8F7
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0x104914C3A6E52DB70C20B62B8AC66393
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0xA474D0E4225557323A8DFDBDE1E5F72E
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x9AF4FD573E93A2E0102A835D75129A9A
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0x42E4DBED867C17CD08571978F3F4BCFB
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
0xC03256D5C427B81EE7A7D12C3F9D8AE9
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xDC4BDE8812C72401236642B64B507290
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x86573FF7F6B136FBE4BC3FF97E526EE3
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0xBAB72C9FB890E207BFB71AED212FA85D
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x3E46907BB75C335F7A93FE14DFDBD8F3
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x62D02EE04DB5D3FAEA59C66D950418A4
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x1031CC66022A18DF7773303C64494276
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0xC003414B2B23365C3D868AABD30E1B8E
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x639D675FC90E45B85C76D233CE12CE50
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x0DE38475D4201CC13AB8D13A92AB0330
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x9141E1449C5B785866AAE1722FC1024F
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x5F1CC907867177997405C7F2FC37C569
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0xCA494B97150CC744BE9F50EE1C7FC87E
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0x421852AF5E97340F61F009C113A22028
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x390A1F3652CE851CB0A8CBBC552FBD7B
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0xC9005E728530F0793363C1C697673B2D
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x4ABFBC7AB84BB4B3B883DE0A88EBCBDC
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
0xDC0AF85895AAB8B820EBE307F88A6721
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"

"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
0x1AD0240F983ACE52B348AB38E7CCA087
settled her here?  Where did you go?"

"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
0x5D7A4954D692B030915D19096A6C1002
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
0x75684FEBF4D6065EEE76EAD6B7373994
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
0x5B1C1F793E915A5249101E38BB5E806A
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
0x3E66C6FABE6FB923F6EC44312CA2E706
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"

my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x073B9B85DF69129E9648512391828304
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0xFCDA3934EDB4EC3E7670D122B30C8D36
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0x8B2665E9187B610236E2F2DA98ECAAB7
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to

eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0xDDAACE608FCA794B64533DAE825C1C91
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x80FA11B1630B3F3F9EF1CF5BE91FF105
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you

mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0x3BDC70C9835F42082A9A5784B61294DF
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I

0x2FBEDFB3930F8330A3FEC303845F97FF
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x0FE82359A345542C3121A2D5363B5D42
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xA178F6FDAB584F934D0133716A95E545
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x830CC50DAE5B6A51ACF21A22E0A6D5D3
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0xF4AD06BC3CFD8DC8A0931B2ADBCD8214
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0xFB2D821BC19C1A27D6A6D0F16847647B
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0x7AB362E9EED00BFD293D40B843F94CB5
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x17C2DDAB08A5F51F7F9AB11C39252CA3
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0xD37DD26BB1BB20CB87C8B5ECA45A2662
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x03D02542F59D44F428E1A555AC1FFC38
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x23B6BBB7356880081B2F4953EB7DBEA1
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0xB95D3FC175A939364A4C5CDD047833F8
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x971ED13F3197F846F55B99F349C0E00D
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0x0D76A187BA91BABC6923A2EEC1A5106B
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0x3A5DF2B7C371EA59C1681694A1E1AA27
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0xC61C78BCD72C8BB32A6D94C0101B9402
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xEF419A6530711BC2CE5233BBECF6661B
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0x136622C9AF35235FD153B3A736C03C3B
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0xA466F87FD45CB6DFCF40E1105E7B2D19
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0x436BD49898B466412D679CBFDD45CBC0
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0xF79E601E4B6333AA55B97A8DB148BFC2
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x1531AA2E67C98A6D76E98AB4D174FF59
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x95E808A4231B1A653A37BFD1201DEA21
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x2AE92A667179E254AD6FF0B57E4FDC25
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x7A22589117044A22B900B0CAD710EFE0
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
0x8E241D2347D27793A5C962D72C09ED49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x6082EA5E8C71B05149C45BAF606A708B
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0xC5E6E0F7C8478E41D931B60BD2FFB763
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0xD5F5302CC19364CB1623CBA147B490A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0xFEF8F9D453B55DE31B0C17FD638FD27E
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x8210ECF6C35FA32E55B2CFE2B73A7C73
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xC0AEC8039638748A0873589AD801A39B
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x43D2E27944E974986849EEF7976C29B7
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0x4D0D1442DA83EF179B545AF3AD3C69C1
Giacinta, and Clara."
0xE7DA76069568ED8A4588519723D76E56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x86BC0713BFE7F78EE107D504B190F870
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x37039ECEE5CAF7927F8A37FB0E2A9FC5
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x65C06F7D919A190F2CFED225EA101F58
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x30782A6C4870A7FD2366164B41A7B838
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0xDA907CF0ADE3FA8DDD94DA6FC3B725A1
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0x6726F665769B2587B5F080A1451E74E5
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0xD70B617CF41E7C2C939B1AC6A1C0105C
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
0x6A1BABF4EC47D09183E9F313121FCB79

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0xE9D69A0C0A55FE877EB0EFEB22C15250
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x4458DB7A5A4251F9D6AAB27390A42C9A
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x99D4EF62E1FD062E50F94DB75966E753
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x6FE993F5A39844159FCC6F60DE62CE5B
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0x7FCACC1ADAF102C3456E8E2A8170B588
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0x32CF85B7F55B430B3038013EA9493CCC
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x559D8818D60642BFD437E11C867610DA
back to England.
0xA5C821726205EDCA0B8751C2BF2D70F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x16AD9C0AA3094491C07868F517B95ED0
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0x65513D383A24F7C851B83DBAADD07E5B
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0xED243139CD1C13FA06422D2935F70278
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0x5E556AFC67358B6B8DA1CF1C10588A4C
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0x170590DE09998C4C554981D4F631EC61
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0xD278FB97A45D97434C88BAB3773C6491
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x063C01E5D477AB51C53791E95E46E7A4
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x506713D76BAAF08A9B0A411364D5008F
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x5CD88E0DC4C0716FA2E9501464C89749
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0xB8A477982401DE56DC34E1A5857483E6
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xD6B4AD0F148EF8B1BFB4799B73477FD1
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
0x6DA9D50D037F7BBDCD5B2A227E86143D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0xFA2CFB374E0603543CF3EB43C6A5BAAB
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xC6DF0A3630953D3AE8EBC9D8BFEAEE5F
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xA7BA38587ED17AC33A66CE0294A292EA
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0xC85624C9FAD029E6D30D48BBD758178D
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x9864CEB1C6D07B0D029A0ABE79324BAC
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x7DE3FCF29BE6DFEB81C0555022853E83
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x2F85CC88AFB219C0927A15A48558E0DA
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0x32A5555C8350EF299B6640D7857F8335
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x25B2DC623CDF649DFE9CECFAAA57938B
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x7EC8CB48A75BA1D178330AC83DF9320A
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x5F0870A856900FDEA674D9BF89CC1D74
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x5FE272F48267D3A4FEE2B1972C8CC428
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0xF40CF25025CB37D3F9674C71F8E19F4D
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x40CF12CC13A064EE4B60A34C2B6DC5C1
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0xF03EE7804B0B609A71C728FF1CCC7933
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0x02E0D29618A114A000A50E0B21878ED4
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0xD673BE57EC24B5EF99149D80B0D06B6C
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0xC81ED7037ED784AF91710DC45E771694
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x3F94985A26502E46166D0D1AFA8BD703
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x00A88566DD34FC15C18DD557AB92519A
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x8CB212491F167E68D62889289C5CDCF7
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xAE1C21E499D2844CC043BCC7461E97DD
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0xCD2A7FB6E1EF1B2129F17FC6A4012E4E
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0xD5A15DE863BE3DE544F037B291EE71B7
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x6002E1446C11A6A827F7F12B6C1600E3
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x4E3D614B5AA6AAE514815706FD76DFB4
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0xD73F43938229C4850DD25F626214A04A
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x7B3FA94FFF8AC1AFB622AFA652943CE7
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0xC7D5DC77E9535BB884F7D243BF40EC98
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0xF20C351ADF01EA3EDBC8B3AD43B3DEAE
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0x758DBE2664F9154C295DDB2F0EA2C9F2
out of my sight.
0x3E8818AD70C8BB13EC10A0357C6FA94A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xA5003105B058A57689AB6DAE1A749875
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x2826DE50FCA452A086F81F17161BA589
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0xFFE1FB05464A2383DC8BA49A4906D0D3
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0xD2280790ED8D0944005813D226CB0B20
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x2B480C1331285CD879EF2274ED0BF500
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0xF9788666EB7DD927AB12A83B8BD4BEDF
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x8BB11FBEBD17A46ED3E390456FBCE76E
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x97016AD6EC85D94C5D51CBFDBCC3B433
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0xBBE2CA97B6E29CFBAB39F76813E3653A
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x1B4AFA76AACC3ECE6436BA44BBD27FAE
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0xEBB6BF8C6CBB043F0BC6943A3DB5EF58
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xA86DE85F00FC239C7A5ED7A1E623255B
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x2809FF10EDEEAB421437086EE860DC35
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x2D0271FB6355CE1DED66F27D5BB85BF9
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xC61D765F2686147A6141A9DD636A1B3C
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xD4E5D92C7C196962117FFBC06BD41865
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x7760D0AE942E9C20CC75385B7C25094A
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0xD01AF547B52308D8AF1A99F5C94163CB
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0xFB71535922D9B73B107420618D46891B
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0xF642BF765DD4D4260CBF993E4C2E569A
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0x964D0B547A01B4AFD9163B72B174A1DF
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0xCFEA0C0CFFC921E0A78831445D893F58
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0x268FDAE672BE832E94C4D3F167E99600
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0x737DE104C22D940D11A4B39451D51E9B
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x060FC83906105B568E0DA0346B053F8E
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0x91830B00A3A2F92372E6FE9E5CF1B7AA
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x2D95005510E4C5BCC900F24011C1E357
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x48D302983012D18891433E7A933ED255
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x46A41B3D2372FD7E1973F6B9FFD66025
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x3AA7C2DE8E556ABAE2002425F49DA0A5
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0x2982617FDEDE2459116BC3475B0310A9
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0xE61AEFED14474DA14831F353DA6F674F
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xD0A951ED7CBAA645B106EAB6BCFFA560
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x83B15BC8C2D91E256AB80AE07A38CE2C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x42D4008FA585B2DAEE6E975C1CFC5DA4
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0xEBDE5401DC54821D1CFB782D5FB27A99
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x9171B8FE40C8E741BF14D4E910137B6F
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0xDD06E140C2993615BE5E85BD6FFA65ED
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x53EC138A27706C7A4DE90C22465F63A3
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x20A37406BDAAFF0F8692719B8AC79BE9
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x2B0B8827AD24CD0A81494452C09E7329
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x565DA90CDF07FE8A8758CC846E68D5F8
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0xE8866EEF91D87D5352B83D48C02301AB
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x3831CB6DF77BECB5A62314C0AB3307DF
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x2C7A15B99944B278CC4B97572B243873
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0xFD30EF98ACEA7C433FB2632F6099151C
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x853475F867AD43DD38797E39372F7DE4
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0x230D519B1171E49AAD689493861F1D1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x9ECFCF440ECAE01F32DDB47968BBEA64
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x4E829D609CD1E6F85272DC23118422E5
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0x23ABA0993A883405D6AE97E4122DD05B
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0x865A03CE3FBB9891CCE043D220845703

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x4FDE96A3824A37778DF3AF7221406D05
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x1243FFE253554D5C72193F921F88A5A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0xDA6280CDD1E882A2B42E609602CCE7D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0xEEDC1020C0568B5CAC8A85BEC2245AFB
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x38D2486B2708F5CB859075E9ED8B768B
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0xE88E2C9074E2EC58AC2D690917D2DA6A
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0xC6A0A2F98B6EC840B2794AA9D885B913
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x62968219A9FF3A08CE4DC1A3965304E0
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0x1E5B327BF66AB3A2BF3D82EAFE6EC36A
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x1AFFEFF9BF0E64A420AE9D69EC45D4E0
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0x1F7B2AC36F04AE72000347B61415D406

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0x7FE31ECFD4449D4C43C7BBE339BC3F57
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0xE455E2F065A05BA2F4A38E7D673D367E
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x0EA46DF05ECFE08682D56D24B81AD9AB
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0x7E0624375E81ECD7F2783298FC9BB635
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x9D5DAB240BF0A7D87BEE14750B420D38
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0x02FEBD1C551F9B0EB165A1632BB4FB09
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x49CD91FD746CA80E10FF753A10D447F9
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x6CCB621CB96379A23C38372F12175627
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x8D69B267598318DE1E388726B2279EB6
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0xDF82953C2CAD7762EAC085C1E65A544D
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x19C42176C9838A36D5635AFD29A52350
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x1D9F13E24482FC44369DBB7858A71BF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A pause.
0x986CBFBECADC267A13CAF306EFDB1618

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0xAD7CCBCF6E51E9AC5C1F06F998FA1123

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0xCE0DCC92ECA9E8A4E90E9740A5FA678E
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x62AF43922C962755A842099C9FF03003
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x67245D85C1C142BD64A3C59AC0812987
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0xEC848E7C262D23A9C823BB577B72740F
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0xB8FB1A4F60A70F76E5F0BBF262E95E43

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0x0D1B50F1B8D5BB2AF2102D74DC0FE69E
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0xAD61E3E92A3DEBCEEDDFB4C0A5803F32

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x7B51B2EE9F22730239BD94F1DF89260F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Another long silence.
0xB6C397D7A611FFE8118E24A5961D9459

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xB99B6FA8FDE0DB3A2DDFA074A3F379C7
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x02D9AC7AF3C6C3820385AAF23F868257
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0xB775A0C672EE11AF12CBC86DED36118D
and to let me go another?"
0x4B7F19FB631290330E95EE975BF20FCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do."
0xD88AF1D3AA2D2B5DD87D18D46AD4CC5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x23F01D1952D3073B310F69BB2C642A58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do."
0xD88AF1D3AA2D2B5DD87D18D46AD4CC5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x25C2CE7A5EC62A5C715CAAE410DA8DF2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x797B171BD21F8A99413871F85238C6D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x584B027AB19E726351F6D5CA13877CAE
to love me."
0xF0482A049C981816BCCDC3D7A8BFB71C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It would to obey you."
0x26930058E12C9FB09C95F57207245B62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xE8C5571E94E68615F1D84C3C6E79C8DB
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x959BAEC354DD29324E816CE748FF66F9
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0x06A9DB28AB984D9275096DB99FF93633

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x2F9932DD9DA14693B6C1D920C7C0C6C3
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0xFE4BF708C0875AE0FA262D407246C3BC
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0xB685C3847B31FEDC7D2FF0D6A50DF684
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0x99182F00D17F58B2C7F7A22CA0792A9A
companion and for some hope?"
0x61802BD856B7845E28D2EFF591B39DC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0x8E6F106A19BE7B2C2A64AA3355B7D676
again there."
0x4A0FBBB217D686D6AC070D3AD6AE8882

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you will not yield?"
0x2BA2FA047CAD3CC3962ABA8D47A5C802

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x601EE014FE7DF4CBFDD7BD9C4E277258
rose.
0x5A4DBD58372E6D503875662CFBBCB698

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x4150325C52727D6899FB776DE26604BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0x7482BC4CF8B39D018323C229216F195F
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0xE7C7B60C96810AB3972D9CFC7861F439

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x5AF695ED4B4DDBE2D5020D2A36558BFE
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x2597F6A0F98F45A9C11FC007C8DCB987
will forget me before I forget you."
0xF1BC13542654EA12D23682EC54F4469B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0x542B364F12A0F491BAA74B18364ECDB3
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0xA64C5759BDB821EF326D6F06CE515DAF
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x3D863367636631C2C5BFCB5BF992A9DE
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0xE36E83FFAE449CFF11CDDFF2427DC084
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x29AA628D09F622642821971593879208
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xA36F83B4C4E1C648CBB0C862C240F251
by living with me?"
0x8E2FA3E66F81B9381F699A5769B4303E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xA54B45D086B83FB357110EAA8F71C916
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x9B22AB58495AB48329EF0FEF5DDCE80A
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x00A422626587D34150790D4251FA7D9C
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x16C558B1F10259D907A5FEDDF28F211B
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x6801B38B3D2C0FCC9F7CCD721EC52729
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x06C852EDF8F163741AE12BEA337856F3
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x6BE684C03BEF6868920D7473E61A2C30
who will be injured by what you do?"
0xECC7B60AFC2EF66477FA2D76B1C6A33B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x40A070B25D722B9EE3837D64803D556F
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x9710AB8C67C22C05EF2AF5225C442E13
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x7E32239B2710A87E9CAD7D992ADC0575
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0xA922E67D0B822475AAF2B8808FC0941E
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x6F753BBB27EC632B184EEC057E6C3403
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x96B15376CE0A67272BAFDB96BD8FF1DD
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x2326812D6E8D4152B0FB5141537ED6CB
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xC074FCB5B73C9E550A1923DEBF3C012B
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0xD1868827ECB49194A4D7507479E12088
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x83863F816CD9610EACE806411AF9C2EB
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x5439F0C96A212CE5035EFACABD9037CC
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x4F28AE658B09D16107DFC4ABCA41575F
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xF9D3F49E0843F73BC50BCF49DA39B78A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x99E7091EADBE540A6E14E7EAAEA5675B
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0x7FC099E6CFEE005D3F8F3852E1D13DCC
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0xD10D66633756E0E78F92CBCAE54FEFB4
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x5B8E76E1EAD44FDF6264E06F1AB8F2D9
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0xC66B890BF0544CDB808A3FAC86EBB87B
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x047027AED8FDD6689A7D74C9FEBCC7F3
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x0AABC3AD01AD1CF551D62B6A25C1334F
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0xF31FFD34DFEFD94EB6D1831291AA80C3
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xC38E06BC6209473F978F75FB73052DF4
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x5F3A57087B1A1EE3824AF0CA0B070E53
strength almost exhausted.
0xD46348907754F218C26F48E469ECCBC4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0x0548A5CFE353765BEC5D90B7A3F40D2B
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x05BE5989B7DB334DD00C378DE9614D0A
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x5327D2F6B96056F169B46849E8C58FF0
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x1CCFAC625F4770E4F82ED98E37E16C8E
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x6FFA558147852470C0ECE2BC3931F27E
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x326A60693CF8BBCB10C75106D160AFD9
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x5F05A2F7D66711D8044D9E34F26B4AA8
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0xEC897BA80AE8DFDE991B3775C7B2EDA2
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0xB71C3D0E221D36EF1855408366744CE6
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x88E48A431F6E8C9FE93556514970C4E2
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x8A5B36F3BDAC9B39FCAB1379FF7504AD
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x38C0D34BF2000007F5DFAC6245DEC3F8
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x2ED9BFB3C068A30AF583F44672938449
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0xD5A925AA7F983E13CA1634FEEA781BC4
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x1A81F2AFBEA32C1F67B08F5107D07468

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x22CADA91F68EF26AD9D1E9BF885299A8
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0xA499839BE3A21C7E6762D69707304E72
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0x11D7DD63730DAF33B2F2BEBFB155B463
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0xDA0C22517F23FDB055CFEAE4D71106E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are going, Jane?"
0x599A40445D4E22D463D8B50953C32F6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am going, sir."
0xD3BEC262B2F183B3502E2147BD31582B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are leaving me?"
0x861FDE0A16F329569BE21D4B7E7F590E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x55FAA0A19F9F6A30A04B53BCDA90BC5C
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x44B76E33872EF6C01E5BE2947E1B2965

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x30B23144BD64A95924B4509B05BAF0D2
firmly, "I am going."
0x85ADBB8BABDC9FF9F59CCAE9AE8F3946

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane!"
0x3F371E548AC0CDC75E4EBE86BF299919

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x591DA8714D3DC91F7BB3B071CDEAB18E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x3D6278708DFA4DC81F7CBE0C0EA2133E
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0xEA08C211F3EC6EC5556BCE62776EED36
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x09079C40BF447588BD2AD0F6F73EAC84

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x84881308D3F6D5F9ED691B9021EB8B1D
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x2A881DF28077F886E6D456536412009C
deep, strong sob.
0xB6EE2BC91805E537FF11431AEED320CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x2F81D8E397D2BA23FB2DCEB841148AD6
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x1F932A1D9BC56084DBBCDCDD64D10D27
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x2A6A16BBF21546F4C6B4FFC7B080B3CB
hand.
0xA81E9A8940EE32F1A84021124B968ABF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0xDC1664F2BEF1998E0D404AFE27959294
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0xD00AADFE3D62E3361E01E580C9B2BDA7
me."
0xDC73E151799F58C3AB956A79E3CBCD12

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0xE21F24B0C5173E6C32A668978C2DE026
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xD6EC8AF3BB0A54B381C7CAFD949DE942
yes--nobly, generously."
0xF7F7378C6BDA9BBA6975E52DA765D938

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0x9AF2AF59C7A34523E9C6C118FC34175F
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x95AA9094BF0DF92CF5348AB5C13B5B46
once quitted the room.
0x8EDD74D3670B8DAF13B83E3B365BAE9D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x56C207B074BEE9EE3F10196703B8385B
"Farewell for ever!"
0xDD6CD71A669E1E99F2B0A6EAF7FAA1C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x7DE05A14802AB64AB5EC55A041502CE7
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x0BEDF605EDDCC6B6CB253571BC8065E0
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x953B3CFD3A374429F3824B5B392BE05E
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x4C483A96B4E4EF5DA594F5023911B99F
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xE6D1ECBC2EA9E78D568E756946521150
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x0F8B71D974B7835B5CFD917DC94CB13C
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x1794FA1B20EC18B5DD87A3A26EB27DDC
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x05F20B8506CA40D2744F21C091225AF4
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x2B77F2366F224024DC6A0CF0DCFF7CF4
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0x8482D4A346097712A0DFF703B9F35BA4
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0xAC09EAAB59C579EF59F7B336B9A95079
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xAC4AE5CC026BE76228055205C017AFA7
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0xB0487AEE9CE23D1A1160B2A2A1C6BC4F
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0xB33900B4D9CB0DF18D418E018D8A5F9B
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x4853B7FF87F9BC0C6BA31F90B2A13753

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0x6F34686F7581256B1668926127F2915C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mother, I will."
0x832AC0CD9AA0E2897627E41DA2ECD3EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0xFC0CC694A5E7AC65AF212BAFCCCAACAC
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x094BEE95A00E813243303CD2EF5A626F
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0x9499940DCD154C1DF46F1CCAA64EB927
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0xE9329129085C10232F615781449863CA
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x076E4DA4CC5AC80F75C987FEDABC280F
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0xAB208D88B0B87028DC0397439CABDB69
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x1CA5AD9784B7850B79DC032B1B018057
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x04F65E559BE95AE207A033AC9EC129B8
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xDA11F2097FC13525E45FDDB31687C18C
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x54FE711076511C81996AB2C432BD54E3
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0xFB758419FA8CDD474F9FF4BF74C7B1FE
from my room.
0xBCEB88A691B7F62EBF2B7B2B90D62A12

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0xA795D8C1D8E95ED4EF4CD37C6BAFF83C
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0x8A600BB9319F9ABEEC27846D332B61B3
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xFD878D208A936B88C27E0E4C5AB84E12
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xDDB7DCC5B0FBDA99B22F339ED5D3C23B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xE56F5A234CED4A753BFD2EDA680C9389
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x48B574D3207E6D0C421A29EA1E05061B
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0xC9CAD1F45AAF4161A0D63EF8B0823F0B
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x5D143211292FE9177CE9768EA2670CFC
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x1E1AB279E78D55905F94997F759DDD4B
to go in and to say--
0x3E4D97744DB8764B78C9E06C1B8C5178

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x73C8D01422AB0B59B435B2D640DAEC3E
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x81678F8DFEE5FA9DE9F133D8FB192D68
this.
0x01CE6067890EC9401697A486E55075EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x2C86BD969A2E8F7BACB2D4F42F4475DD
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x57E90D06F03D420CC52FEC39AB47E7C8
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x9ED178D9C87D28FF4CCD6456124ACE73
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0x94457C6BD40EEBC03C7B3C9746DC8910
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0xF4C1EB478BF5EFC73333893F5BAC11A7
on.
0x68F07C89AA988B6528D5E77C2C4FBEA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xBA066C538CA38E6087BF63E652371740
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xD148907DA598C63B70D3AE79A204D7B8
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0xF825EF2B2FF99DBD3435E051A137071E
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x500662F31F1D86F02070E7A638FF4DED
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x5C85F27138C92C639C6AA2D74E5864CD
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x420DBF64939BF8BC46A9401124553B05
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x5CB1B8E04A6927969876D6BC765CF44C
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x21758CEC6B167094C80A30347560F368
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x99C3747EFC2F5C1EF777125E59C41D26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x9C56BC54064F8C432759B525EC34F12F
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0xF0A7F1D07BE508DCB5FAB697D8F7DB87
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0xBC9C10674F816A777470AB7AD79EA7D7
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x7D87621FC9A29B2E107ECFDA9D7AFC72
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0xE0D099C797CD45B00DCCE0378C7382FE
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0x70C2AB41311C57219E2651C457879BFB
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0xB1DAB3E052D971FB9693677B846C3896
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x6485DD3995A80821EAC4DB4C54C07C2A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0x2646CB4A6ACE365E4B98354F9CD6FE31
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x844E559419A8F1607722B617FFEAA868
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x12E1247B946453E636B6B058B93CDBE9
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xE8E69E05ADFBD8BD996E83C7CA339409
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x16920878830552E2970A9A1AB7513C66
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0xCFB3E0DEB4E77907182D0E1C9A8DB0C6
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x8531F8229237C2C3915A907D1DB23E18
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x955C2BB57A69E4F89D278FF430AEB77D
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x3530B7A6F98BC2207811C1337137CB83
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xDFD137F39199FBDF02D79DA2BDF0516E
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0xE0835FC2A50908D89ADD8D10CC440E70
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x98555B539D2D9FBDEC48E397EDDB1E4A
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x72DA9EEF2ECD35142F5E92F62A5BEB46
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x178E35193B24ECCAD389625685953733
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x665B031CC523F1695738A1B45A1EC5DD
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x18B2F1DCF92C1BC316CFA16ABD298686
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0x39BABFD68F65288668272EC3D3CA2688
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0xB7BC743D07DE0B9FC1D129B6B1123FF4
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0x0035702756F5D7A71D418F3C761ECE04
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xDC353C1C23811E9FE37FC8DF9BEBF38C
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x033ADEE4BF574563F5302CA358BA9C0C
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x271226A044BE4EFD7FEA866E4741B3EA
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xF00BAABED97434F2A599BAA930FE3A71
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x191417138A9C6472FF7A9CEEB9162FC5
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0xDBB79072C16D22C5328C4D26B78E3D56
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x59DCF1D80BCD2DC1C22273B17BD4FD96
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x497ED5C894C365C20CE38FC5BDA17386
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x4045AC6E32B66DA769733674C9BB6F2D
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0xFF8122333646BFC42E6C6B0AFD2E5674
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0xB12047099AD89BEF147D0AEB9460B88D
ever to reach the road.
0x69EB876AAFC79371A5F360F268E75729

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x4900B0BA5E8475DA6C1CF8F4CEC93943
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xB803BACEA15226D09F8CCF60FFC2D505
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x65F1B466597B9096574C9DD65753D3D8
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x89E4EA7FC1BD0B748C555D705688A74A
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x5421B81D6FFCD3F7FC2C69C9AC721D19
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0xF11D106F796B9DCBDA54A478D202CB5C
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x7AE4B3567F23DD2138725F663A818D57
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x388BA79E871E74C6315CD240D44E6AC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x379BF86E0BD776F0BC04F023B32602AB
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0x621E62D31F705B52D447D2E007B17598
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x973745F8EB8F79ABF9146FE833DE9DBB
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0x559D604E046134A2B612B9D9C272D761
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

0x2100C56A92E60E433245D078A06F4AD7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x140A65EDA7D5DBD7F930EF75A428EFE8
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xD1B3316D7CB110BA2FF25046DE2143F2
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xBDB7A590CBFEC80BAC35CB299B530699
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x6F67B7741D7A67DF0FC8FE79C112BF9C
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x3FA247AF36508E5D5EC8FDE2B3C18200
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0x66178A60E1990ED7B3CC6554EFEC29CF
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x7DA42FE7B614B30898CB4286BA440B26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x1CF63D3C05BB734070118783D63E6A4D
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0xCE2338B373B85CEDD75C4D17B0C4C73C
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x10448D3F78F9C38F7E3884C970005C66
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xFB8A808FE0D3ECEEB1FE09950BE8ED3E
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x206BA95551DA5F270CA94DADAD5C3A67
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0xA2CA9D1C3B1AD872B3CBACEDCF49B0D9
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xEB7942A45B8F3BD5C9F042D2D8C38A79
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0x7BEE416EC7AAF811FAC1223286BF8CEE
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x4FFCA2D690E4553E630E6C96FBF2A89C
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0xF47971C8DEEFFAC260E2B377D62EB88E
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x99595D7CF032F1ED0B71161B47A19D32
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x6C243AECE47BF3EE179A930477A1CA38
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0xCBE213AAD1FD1264DF0B1B0DDD43F0B5
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x63D60EEFCBBFF45E2B75967B7162EF61
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0xC7713612E8ABA255E771868600013744
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x01210ED7CDBDB19DE2F82D6F4509C809
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x64B9B03C57F030EC6C4B85B6F2046379
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x5886013C20D2006CF926377F2F0C6681
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0x997FEC3E76A6817CF7B38A31D0BDA9BB
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x1BDD86BFFD13110D9474CDBA0AC5CC5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x374B7A26162275620447B81D147BD942
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0xDCFA98892249BED14FC8EC6976751AD6
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xE7F9454BFDBCF2227FE1D011C4810F06
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x2C92293DB05976B0BD514B6AAB5C0CFB
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x1792A03D123C11475B87DEA8DEE85DD5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x1D39684EF4F771D8812847A10F2E643B
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x7444FF27EAE5356F1588A7EE4C63B949
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xB11EDAA1D41A135B295450BB1AA654CB
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0xE154B27A40992815B15ED62256913744
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0xBE75AA232A289C3D58BA4F6DAA5660F8
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x4D11B4EA649DDD8F46D0D30C7C3A7E43
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xC777E4E86E76D958F488E6FB02FC0135
regained the faculty of reflection.
0xF27370850806A520377DC4E82FF09742

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x8F70B19766FDC3E95AFCC4704D732FD2
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0xF6A13B438B150F83547D9363B031CE0D
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0xDC771C1E795A858B8BC8AEF724341AA7
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x3A02181796CF16BB270F84304170EFE6
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x0CB7B5CCC0298FD4430A2E0183A2C81F
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x62923F7BBA9D1668C23CAE250746C9B0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xBBACFBA8A491F823B492A655BA984BDC
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0xB549DC8AFA2C78931739847C1ADF5AEB
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x6F37912C1C483A15275E1A0E78A4153E
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0x6EFF18677BF84F5CA68FA7F213938E69
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0xE178C65581293137EA42890DCEDEED88
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0xE45F01DB3E257ACF3B67B1BC260108A4
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x15895D88AB97673FF339C8C64E00457A
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x8B88A469E6029F839E17DA630E8F0140
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xF8A74427F16D07076C095EA39D4BFE75
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xFE50A89A91F5B93BFB4CE2D48C81283B
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xB98C160E678A6C960E343F36B0195140
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x0079F3DBFF6507EB3CD096653461B08E
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x253D7142C46708AAD462938F3794C6DD
then chose my couch.
0x86412987BC36C0BEAC0F6F61C28AB3B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x5C31A49269406AEC4EAF0EDC837D6043

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x7D13EBA3001BB7E7BAC9F3BBDD4064D9
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0x31326F0F3BEF38C5E432A9208A93C9BF
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0xB7250CA17447062CBD75FB1738265E50
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0x7C2E060EAA142E9E0C89B87353B9E38F
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x29C79826A9CD5AF044C8E648A0E0FB9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x495EA5C6785D1C8B814D09DD0A25386B
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xB7F93763DB64C2EF9CFCC6D4EF9F5870
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x6A35720984526C269B29B456D122AF60
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0xF5A91EA43F20D6DCA29705E6B15B10B5
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xDFF6294DAFF98B0666184907E0323E46
attempts to seek him.
0x46257C7F2E65A0F2E5212547AA1A43B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0x63BE251FC36C75C797CE8F5CEB889B55
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x17022D288F4018AAB6FA80F0C351AB6F
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0xA5B16EAC5FE067627CE1147BAB146094
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x82E7AD5E491B63AE6F830578C66B92C1
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0x889A00A99D2E507A583A10CDEB44DAA7
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x9A05B61D5052B02AC5932D0E74DF4F43
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x651367793D99DC05FEC201454DED9AAC
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x962F5241B12A7C1521309FA894C9200C
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0x8F312C3D286847D8E469BC22965B4EBD
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x4A374AA8E0106D14DBAFF0BC884E7C76
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0x388AC4D28661082FCAA9BB1FA0CCC9A9
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x6E0D1FA9D5E7675A68D280A9A79BDB7E
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0xD1F7D02A6A1001CD99ABEC9D87ACB68C
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x4704465C007C238061C52BF2E88ECF78
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x052C5FDFEAD440A8CCC266098D042EDA
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x6963BD7B569061A7ABA92CB24D483B7D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xF0AC2E7EBDB9B2E2A5DBB8226D5A8FF8
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x2D3CA204C056CB656D567AD7B8924D6B
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x84885F07D52C5AAA29D3B6E994729FD8
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x203BDC8A197492912A58EAF8235EA98D
looked round me.
0xE7179CD43AFDF19407E5B979EEE7E68E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x62EB0A7A356954243C6AD22F5835668C
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x95A27073AA17F734A9EECBE1E35250BE
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x87D1D17D1EA916C4DA3117CBDE3B5329
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0x4497FE80CE21980AD406C66BA609187A
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x808A3B8467FDDD49ECB3DC61D3EFA0A8
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x0C47E18EEAE861DE1E99D3C0BAF8C3F6
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x83FCB3148CE6BF7FAA0F43378FA23C76
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x6DDF5E170DFB1287B1FC752CECDBBA8F
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0xC59DA52F4821CE8AA5CEE244E99A2A59
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0x917A71EFB950862FA59449062FC4BE2B
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x4A383FFDA2744511D1C58E84FC6BD209
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0xCCFBA1B4FA7C5C8E6209745611653873
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0xA05E2AF171AE0F18C60F96080F6485E8
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xE303A96802ABC2C443A5C4ECA8BF866F
out.
0x0CC936583BADFC1A43077EFFD5535D36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xB1AB63EC085B28AC7C65FC0CB9AA0410
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x23F76D2889DBAF0DEDB44E3E96654AB7
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0xEB81A1E5D6F4578961A7E14F0894B2C7
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0x7E698705C305340BD4B820CC1252DA9A
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x05ADC5EDA391D529CE6D22086AC67116
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x16F99DB4E6968A76546ADF36F114AC34
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x3865C1D537E8BC1F6F695668DB1F1124

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x62E30982F491A3C55BAAE60CF5EB0577
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0xF5D12B6252FDEB9AAB6307F08F20CD28
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xA38B1BAC1668B4236AF83EC30C2D5A6F
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x703076F9E4B60FEBA2B7EE6DCAE6C835
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0xE8BCDDB89C28D64C8CC25809DBFD1168
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0x19C909DD92259BCCA27D42A47EB1BC8D
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x32E5F78CE76539AE68CE59FE53F60A8B
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0x6D63C3DB45E321767E883075E9D09219
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x25FDB434AF02B601342A8809171D93CA
like the rest.
0xF25BAE2C1D3AD2C1A8A579238E2E6802

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x48DCA02BCE02E7B810D1B9F8E9B08814
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x3FDD570D38DDBEB5C6019254FA4A0113
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0xB4EA7D7020E80FBC62EBF574D2328493
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x06A381CA6FEF9BF1063D4D0B1F5C5DD4
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0xA8063ABE42A9F3362EF30140C33D5F31
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x4A2161AB9294DD0825A8565F289A7762
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x36270E325E402D827226D96903967C56
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x581396B93EA699EF89AB201E680F5EB1
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0x91F435B87ED3B955D9C810CB96777BB1
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0xFF0B37A30E6DEC72B75360F601F5F39B
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x5FF2407BF5BD10B0D8BB94570285A6AE
would not; but I must try.
0xB17DB8D63E3211A4B271265F06C2517A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x2EE789198ABA13EA686DA17BC88A7535
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x109043C9929C078B4A26A8A4A00E4EBB
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0xDD883BDD20AC108593521A0A1970944E
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0xDEABDF192634316C384FA9BB01B47D90
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0xFABB93187E6F5A0F985DA8369165C9F4
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x8AFD31D57F23B6A6B9BFCF086ADD974B
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0x02C9BA1052C28B02108DFD8F25E1EA65
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x32855783DBBD39AE05B560065F7632E9
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0xB26BA066A96A0855D55E2C6FE87E2437
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0xD36F11B1E7E3598AC71CFAFBDAEA3D0A
the village?"
0x4B71570EB87FCBF5DE2AF3E527FA9548

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x227B1CBC0CAF005A7B545BC135E41FF8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0xD12455F33129B796859CCC89A659B5B8
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x5B4F69E7089D30851224224607312E67
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x6C1BBAE422DDC84DB4F2D8EA351940FE
apply somewhere.  Where?
0xE21588713B8DA51F47454930D44955A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x079CB46FE13B0227AE7076B32B0D615C
wanted?"
0x3BFBEF91DE9736AA7E7E0520386D417A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x5B9B9FE1F658969AFB22671820654000

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x4565EE0F74FD66BD0B4D522DDE92A78F
do?"
0x02E7C7456FBBE7FBF042135FAFC5184C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0x9881570E8F04A139587E9745C80A7D5B
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x195880CE5C38E43563D6B345D947520D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x07EB099660E0E7C34215024FF0AE7DEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nay; it was men's work."
0xDFC3A56AB64C1A51AC61069AF57C481A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what do the women do?"
0x43940F7109C5A1F7DDE230A0BFC7EA22

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0xB3F483F7E953787E4BA2FE34F50A64E2
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x3A68B1C4BBCBB0BF2E7ADABED9B3752B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0xE8E32C3020B11983EB4355B364C1C855
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0xAEF84DE02F4304EF4519361ACC5ADB18
wanted.  I took leave.
0xD41656FB44F5E86565DD26D20A2074BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x4FA6BD804F1560DACB2E281FCB303A38
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0xD65A7E7C4754EC91B3FE66191404F36F
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0xFE6005C9BE8613D351E35FFE46239284
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0xF61606ABECD67AE8C0136579360ADCE0
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x019202F9E2A95E0AA50647CCBAB841B5
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xF5A211711449E00C0913A87FBFE005B9
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x699882F550F9374C73726F9B371742A4
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0xF1AD9E9A32483B642DAEC2865F3D5745
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0x798DE827CA15637B1B800592368FE7BE
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0xD1D7C35D65AEFAA794C5936561FCA2FD
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x8E25BD93D3E2A1BFD3439691964264AE
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0x6584215C1989A57867D4A1B682DD2D98
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xB7A236019D2635BE0C9445894D47ADBE
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xFBCD57200190BA77DB0EC8E38A7DA9D8
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x19A9C2E7533A1479916C15F0E4447C95
if a servant was wanted here?
0xEC3601E70CD73B0C8866B847BF28DCC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x74F4E57A7E66783688C5C8BA248FC3EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x7F3FFA3F38464FC9F8997B6AB1D62017
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0x4904570D44B240B5E6F7EFCCC9F7E137
no matter what."
0xE975FD83E23EC73D271F47E9CC081490

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0xFFB77C7B2DA70131F8BD59EE521B755B
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x6E9069BAA59D4D037BE335C889689896
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x9F816B87CDAC1441437E8FE98C3CB166
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xB31579BE7D1A866F7DD8B57DEB6AF12D
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x9AAD769D021E07BFEE525200EF9AF6DC
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x2AE76A042AEBB88672B0BF05501F51CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x94B7E47D83C624DDC5F796ED58460EE9
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x52888A205AF8CF128ED4A183E7CAB1C8
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x279105AE074CF868FC84DEBEEC87C17C
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0xF94529772F4F6ECE7BDAA8371580F9A2
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0xA5CD6567DC07ABC96BD0AEF98C7DC1B4
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x9CD283F1DC054B1CAF6A40FFBD044BB8
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x0C50C07E5B00ADB51C405AC639F0CF7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x2F80EDA1F821154507EC390E35F3FA3A
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x82215D071706224603086895C72A4166
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0x0F559A81BF2991C86C6AA3FDFF7590D3
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x77C5E102D93104A54B6849319D94BE8C
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x3D8793A7971789647435D6A01EA5B3C4
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x632EC468B40858111504A4D9F944AF03
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0xC24F387CA1BBB923A802D9270FA7C906
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0x682FFFA71ADC293FD270272EED9F1F30
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0x83BB70F832B17451B1DF4C8766B854DD
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0x52C02285BD4CD8F926B0D9638243435F
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x7BBCFB0FBFF0A3481E321334C661F836
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0x2268B31E2BDA19B4DDF33027962DB45A
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xCF1D6B38F0E933F6FD894C9723EC439D
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0xBB07D7257AC623E9787333E22442FA2D
this the parsonage?
0xF45BF88B0BD99D1738AFB4EC5BDECB31

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xE9E24830D348ABABF27E030106E9931E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would he be in soon?"
0x22F6CE46B47A6DC83AA82DF8763A47A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, he was gone from home."
0x71B1C5594ADFFCA3B4C4C1C4F37EACB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To a distance?"
0xBE4B7291208D705442882AC7563BE174

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x9C8B900F6C1A9F80A0987F7AE5C83B57
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xE4D7C4E8D0BE4AA2085DC83CFE6E27B5
there a fortnight longer."
0x0BDBAFA1AD1D5EB22DE7A6797BD2DAF9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0xAA8303ED441A84F2E78B0F163A305F5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0xEAE76FA39383D2806EFC2EC56C5402E8
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x02C4ACD9D3324990F9DF97E7E45BFC0D
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x2FE9AC546942A3093E846A84356302E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0x3723A7DF3723C01D68EA13D978D1020E
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xB4D0AE3733B131F9C8B302321887E346
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x6851642E759C32EA48436EBB5C39912C
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0xAD90F3F50B83086E6C69B6AF351718AB
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xCF74E2C2CBBA8E01B15B41162EAB14D5
for this handkerchief?"
0xB48F8BCDAA2FA8D6818D1E1217A2F825

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0xDCBBE325DA290C12B9F705ACD5ED7958
that way."
0x8301B011C4936C797C5E2F280E42D96F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x259E01D26B90051DDD2C69FF18ADB471
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x4B8DFFA39F34AF02415F271294FC1484

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would she take my gloves?"
0xA1A8F99957B05EDD44299A7FCEE9FD07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No! what could she do with them?"
0x15361D889D4514A5890C64905D0E7A1D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x7BA56E41D939011C27DA9D544CD32A7F
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xECB662E05037912939087117402FDABB
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0xBDC7A21ECB1F1F46535DD49BD1EFAD86
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xCEB37DD45455AA5667BD01C27F7EC9DF
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0xA9055DBD130264EC2A31E6A96C39E86C
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x7B191167D51F2D801307998C8AB8F526
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xB058B09D238467BC41D011F680590113
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x13F8A07BFDBFCC13E6E4FBBAD1CF5210
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x12BF09281ECE92B1C767EE46035C7026
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0xBA8EDF9BEE4C0B7032BC8E39153CF74B
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x477D7E850FD081D5823D50A53B73299B
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x5BC7710D323C3051AFB19174E7CE9F89
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x67930A28149A4CC1A4F5E3F5FD9D0C67
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0xCA0FCF42DF5AC53E29F7692A1F0AC83A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x049C842D3C670F29980053F2A1D2D54F
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x8863173C3606921766075B238E636AB2
said--
0x5DF3BA679382660319CD85B7EE8D54E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x5E4B25716B2805E7B208B5422EBA92E2
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0xB13457D9C5F5AB2E600C02AD06FE7DD3
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x1D5E522E222472FF5F01A9BBBB49AAC1
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0xC43ED324DBEEFA339A17CA0445554671
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0xCD9E4BD4988C7E11F4A8F05784FA4031

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0xE5A3D62D0DBE08A78A4EC06D04E302DF
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x296A551337F15D8AD1322445A6BDABFC
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0xF9C2335AD238DE90AFA9E509CDB2EB79
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xCC6D7778F563B2E7BEB6336923D0D546
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0xB7F50DD315D79D704838D342798B58BE
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0xA9EE20F5992A20FD19330F8755665A11
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xEAB5C7465B94D3F4C0855EAAE2ED2D68
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x8C12F90D0155BD4DD86307124D324481
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0xBBD8ACA9F584E1D74C56419C7777D67A
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x1AE3485DF19D33CD8E03CF229AE6C0C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x885F5126FABC420BBB3148B2116D839A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0x9F105E17915F93E84685E876F5B6EBEC
give her these porridge."
0x1F491DD2E68955635197042788044E2E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x2F77F3FAEDDD6D5F4C24BCF7F0ED2E8E
pig doesn't want it."
0x45C5A237FE4B8622735C9C5E38C639CE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x32A5B791101742931C2F8B2D1DB3C512
ravenously.
0xFE1D29B561DC59523C48E91519B98CB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x072A077DE466B3943DC5F41D20004067
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x24C9708B235F7756BC499E6089DFFCA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x70AA732C3291863CE99F2050A10616AA
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0xE7A2F86A6B6A16E9EC8DDD1ED04B6EBF
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x8913023FBF70B517E0F4DCEC14B95A28
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x65A06669C9ADED7EBE6B0BB7291DADF0
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x6B60ABCE10FB1BE26DE348CD838C7A99
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xCCE4DC9B0F990ADB6DD3CE1053448EA2
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x5C5CE274970BF66575EECB241CBAA639
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0x9D810AD79136518AB2F019D90E3A9677
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0xA37CF52268D45FFD5BFE01DC193919C1
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xBBA22D5792CB0CF4FAA60C5704A084D3
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x61770E7B612D05A6BCDA2856A6C979CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x323018836849DDA87E6B75461980C2B2
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x69C50FD1ADF8B630F1DD7A7AF926A93A
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x424AD4F7365280E6A9201084A2406949
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x195A97290013E679BE63ABF39F04C6CD
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0xA7AB45A253E2ABE6BE01FB0A92D70973
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0xF14BC4954201FD233AA3198298B2162A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x0BBBD2C0A5EB68CDFB0B095A4FE7384C
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x96EA73C94012005746C8A249BF17EA96
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x5DAC9B7F5343089523182F1F577EF15F
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x3FACFCB3EA9DDDB29171ED7F9D7AD48F
grave."
0xE4428000D46D5B7A30C77EA5685E69F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0xB9FD6EF24C9F00BA7EF65FEFA109C781
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x8D6FCE71004A89232351E4BE1458154B
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0xF4D7EEC3C5BAA64B9F438884102AA541
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0xF920C9EB37B05A85430F2C3B6F054363
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xFF0A565897883F2C35C1CF40A943E879
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0xF4756B5940DF62D948FD4BF9CA592B3C
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x50035E1074571BDB42A74A39C5EC1B3E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xFCD1089AFE1BD3A0B0360F97999F9B6F
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x3D757E2C5A92213D4F5D1476C01027A1
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x929793B634B2C7DE4416D0B97E41D08C
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x600FBC3F59CA08EE2A71E511A6F81882
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x96664FCF5E3BA9B432C4DD16E8A2528D
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0xE732F1D08B9AE99BC7F4E5D3297FC3F0
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0x1FFED0804B61C329BBD9CA8E83AC3D12
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0xD3E46655E560CCE93C20A61DE4B89107
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0xF36306527E98DB0B1281DC70C9308339
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xC023249F6CDE96621882AC736E8C8CAB
it shut in my face."
0xE2F0557854D474198D9D4E25DE2FAAC9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xD947293522D45652F7C3AF6DCE88B760
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x7D6C73A66003D2DC877B72A0DCA3A1E9
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x2158710E6EC1EE4E514749F905D64568
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xEFC229C9C4A1069576A9F2EB06E1D703
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0x6B0535D449C0E01371185BA8EA42EFF1
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0xBC66D79467D3691ADD0E593C5F791297
long.
0x20FE216BCFCD3505462BC18696C5BA54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0xA95FAB9B8164555CE631DA58E4493318
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x19D87ABD5055FEC1AE27E33423A84227
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x17706A6699D5567211068423CFF6B52F
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xB5C2E25443B80E890CDC3F7479F76F58
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xE2957516DB334E95FE49F9BCF0BEDE1C
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x0C66E266029C24234D5DF586B87B2586

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x1A706C47C112B8F34DB2E4122CF6FEF3
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0xAF2364662AB016D99E567F267B51C36C
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x167A2EA894F4B0008F6075ACB0FAB58D
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0x49E2F81A4BECE8C453428447D4A1060C
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x1004BAEC6EAEEEC24799B6246BE85770
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0xBA466C046AA1EBBEFD0C6523093C5CB0
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x6C01CD9FC9BD601095D285C279F6DB31
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0xA3BB6BEEF1598C877191A7634F8DF973
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x5CDFCEAA3119CFEBC788E6720635E09D
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0xED53D731600C7FBF706E0331ECBCB0D4
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x431D44C45B0380396BB7D308ABAA62B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x734208B1CDC19C7F9A24347B9D98207E
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x8665BC3C1A7B938DD0B63DF7D5728928
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0xE64D4EB045CDBC0E075B62091DD5D192
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xBA026BF982F55CC0CA9F6911558BCCC2
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0xEA2C0649656A6E9F85CD61F73DA5D9E5
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x89817296F67849133C7D9CD3DA22137A
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xF07B6B5F749AC7F05E0E6CAE886BB5E9
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0xFD6327D0D884A921C515E5CE2B5FA799
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xF55C07DCAF657956B28E07423E585C2C
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0x69019E086635E9F38FF823A358568A11
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0x8207BEA2CC35FF43BCE6583D95BAE980
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0xE0A9144AEA902F78C71505151D7CF31F
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x1B59551DA4DC1EB36048EB8B0AB28128
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x5AFC11BA7DE85B28FE2FC19AD338A5B1
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x06DC473A8454816DE979BC0BA810FEDE
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0xC6316E8366827D9D274B5E81C4EC928B
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x17E63F3F4C62268FF96A961B1779F2BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x124FAC0CFDF04A58520336F03ABA74F6
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x98CE2B438240BC9DFF6DB9C523CED379
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0xADBA61A4964E2D47556DEEF60FA0CA44
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0x33A478FCB83CD660FC89ABFB64CA5596
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x0E8B2EED4D7AAE145FFF6021C586C4D7
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x6006AC95AF6801108992FCB00D1EE3F7
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0xD45E91F79E3AEDFFF568B58849402DEB
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0x0B920B12AA1B7BF47EAEEE0451F66F11

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x1193CF9519AE6D9A81F194DFB4F321AD
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0xB8D72C410FF38500877DDE58ECD154AF
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x68287F69588819215B2F05E40111777D
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x995A560FDA9E0CC9D7CA5E81E2233EDD
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0xE6D5BCE9FB4786ADCEAF79F864C15B06
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x805E7E79F59FDE5A23CB507FE6A28203
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x0FDBF7A613516F73F1C1783A8594D8FF
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0x320A59C11F68391DDDE97684FEAF8010
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0xDA9C254242287E1507F03C47CD3F2E3D
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0xE7D8579DE325E9F776A0A61224A0AD53
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x1BE44093193E00703E10BFE4A33FB1CC
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0x473B6765E65BAF56884EEFE63164E01B
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0x85E3A7197BF3BC8C5A7CE6527355BEDD
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x2C60F49159E800B7E3B32F937473C3A4
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0xC1A915AE5E18B4EE4BD37548ED45DBD6
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x759C650C69646E5AB54BF2754F4A6B32

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0xAFDC36FB76C0A0251E27C630C0E1E239
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0xA313CFF793B5AD0F0F77A3909E3F9C5F
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x4D0E609A34E446E80501D59CA24A31DD
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x542CAF0A433065C8BEFEBF03BD748B2F
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x4ADCCA10C75C90E86819306EB1928E1E
German I could not tell.
0x4E3C870F0E3F096BA80B373D5FB3CD89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x51AE375912FB0B495569D8C2F3ACB53D
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x4C8D3BD36B128ED5E6F0E05CBF4DC89E
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0xFD96376E632BE7971ECF936A5892324B
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x7BBC6C565F50F33B129429F6C874C6A1
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0xEC34108437D2BAC42A492E9B886B9359
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0x399C85BC6F9C2679399CCDC96EAE68E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x40B11896AEFBC7588784C0FE9678E9B4
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0xFE48975BEFB60735FD9253EE4AE1C989
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0xBCDEDB311EA37AAE96631B51A3C2487F
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x40056C4F35CB11DAD6EE1BF507E8F560
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x5B7ED530EEA50848D16C058126D7428A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Both were again silent.
0xE40AA915C6BDF719034DB307CD8D25DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0x38EC087B359641D6472EFC8C50C048E1
looking up from her knitting.
0x19EA9DBD39ED397871B4A8BFC46BC6AC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0x4D6155E64C0199C89F52FC789817B81D
other way."
0xB8E6C6B61CAC65D12D13220CC78BF50F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x6CED739AAB1A04B147CFA307898FC581
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x6F0D64D6FE15AC0FB61C675A1122D3B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0xAB3C42B96BA84E3CA3701EA7FBE39663
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x7F4BA367C8C912CE40B605D11096EFD8
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0xA4EC617BEB75404D0830B464A3B1786C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what good does it do you?"
0x83EA2989DE89133954BB9955BB8ED855

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x03BEC01B9FB1384F58818F781CD69DFB
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x4E09C2465F85C91DDC33409B36DBF510

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0x8995FF34FE470CFA9C1C389EB17A3B4A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x6EEEB5F822B5B98E7E8F5AF8C110D1A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x1B832EFCAF9F358A782653C36CEF69CC
master but a lexicon."
0x637A858751BE0A64B2777AC97BDFAF61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0xB4B0CBE5402C729F6AE3C01C4E52B869
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x834ED96DD1D961728DC78A6CCE96FBCF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0x39648ACF88A81DD156F9AFF752722F63
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0xBA049D8A16E72E6A17DE182805834779
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xD294A0C5E7171E787E844AB1025A8F30

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x7A7C8547F259264CE118F3B33F4182E1
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xAA2C629BE4AD0EA13F8F02A269D06023

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x84B11787E7F966E67BB32A8A4A93C9F7
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0xBA266E353B1D94B0074B00836C3C180A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0xBB69B221BCF02D82940845F675AF0D93
sad now.
0xE0E7E28DFD83F2DEC490FC64877F26DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x5FFA8E537E89B182FCCF00045B5E1D54
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0x5AB9D87E383E75E6CDB12F3E1057D2A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x6FDAC1DF53B85BC0EAB165A6F1876FF2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x0A870FB71559163AD6464EE76000E20B
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0xDE00B8A8EAF23AE15DD7B9FAEE887ED4
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x4EC291EB1485F75395B05BD9754568A0
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0xC786FD7F602959A68C7F91DC938579FE
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x2603FB4853F6E9B34D6F1F7D1F6185A2
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0xE66031F46B594C186F85A9D4B4AF2D4C
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0xFEC486F5C54DE8E77496FE9583034A5A
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x105279BF160730A6ED9AE8476408A3BA
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0xF1E66407931C579E260A4CDE0078CC1C
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x3344AEBC92B1E708E63F415F46D27992

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x66CD9927B056000FB8E51CEA07A8877F
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x08D02BAC84B41F109FEC0B4515AD0FAB
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x041AFAFAA6C569E580FE1D7C34D203C1
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x7376A72E484F5EF0663A46D1462ABD2E
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xB70F22709F989A089326DBEF7475A274
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0xA45B7FB57F25C43FA11FE9F6FB03618C
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0xC6B356FCD73BD1971F0EFF96D935CACB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x3EA6A074B047E9C42EDE706E148B5E98
St. John when he comes in."
0xBB9D70EC2BD2C1C9A36228D76C152334

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0xB628FAA341AD9DD26C84D4077722BC22
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0x999F302B071AACD447CAA719DDBCBF13
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x8CB6C3CC9C4521A1783377AF0DA05A34
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x5A5870AF0845941954393790E1583253
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x5F22794AD759F1220FCCE88F298FAFC4
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0xA8A8A1EE0CABF37BB66269644E6473C2
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x3BE1FBC3C76123CC7A49F032B0A746CE
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0xC71FE33DB8A9BCCF5967E9173A47B747
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x9937A48B41E39CE869D3519E40F7E06D
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x234C09F839AD2C3CCF08DEB8FDC63054

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x8D93A70F9DB87A5817E8842D7A4214BB
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xB39E5B6F2E7789834190A48227DFBEB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x914CCE8836EB8B9B2CDCB76166A26B10

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0xD56E3A339C19B0E60A4007BB95119868
from?"
0x6731EA25C448EADD659D763891E8FFB9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am a stranger."
0x50C1113EF9D1DC85A5BAC1F58777FF7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x574DBF1C2F5425AC629771EAD986BE89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0xF005A239A9DA11244C89906B02C56336
bread to eat."
0x5925D63BF5382DE41A40FBBC1148E03D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x48AA9CA87D850EB0BC9E8F08B771CE2B
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x18E7951BF2FB05023811A357BC5F39F8
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x1B5D80E7F6BF532F268EAFE348FF0A8F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0x381F531073C5DBAB1B8F066A59DDF6BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x27A357B562A50701E61E71326FA11D58
now; it looks very ill."
0x1DA38200DA488E9EDDC263AC9214BBFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x4EE021A0EC3E782F8CB6CD547A89CB38

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0x421C5D5A2B1CF457D925046E222676D2
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x6D4A899CDADC990602432555EB4C0B67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x24A9F593308751B602EA7AF63217FD2C
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0xE1B005952F70E6B52D2439BC1900B496

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x2A9971EA00B48F97FD6EB785400B17CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x649F0AB3E50D4E77E7C3A0384372060C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x6E3929101ADCC8F45386778D4E415939
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x0061AAA45FEBFA328159731F9D767DFD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x981872B76BAD1B9BB5112C4E2DE49402

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x1E89CE4B85A68526FFBF0AB7A1E2DDB8
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x86DD71C4838736257AF7CE9BFBB213C9
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x976F4410265B08756F6233363D3202F7
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xD5B15984D7848147CA9E8D61475CC6F5
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0x3A5576100B2EF828B029D7E134D07FAF
bolted it within.
0x9AC52682A3A06E536295D36F0A4921BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x6BCF3DB6633E110B3C5071CC58DA4578
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0x3F7A93E12CDC9B9A1711A7C91E5C6500
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0xF619896C33F772A09A3AA49F1415E194
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xC0508E979AF202F4287F9858320E0B14
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0x3A77E1244462953FFA9AA6DCFA8B086E
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0xBA886C304DCF602CB533E532B937AC1E
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x8A77684F8569D5422035FA05F3EF0F3F
endeavoured to regain.
0x470818565468EA98CC98EB108489DAD5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0x64480E1D8426E2DBB170AC672A153E6A
will in silence."
0xE8F7F496708D9FAEF12B389B229C0952

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0xCB2434494F76D6628D63A5E89B0DAD21
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xABEFEB54BCCCE38FAF5C71D7ED472CAF
and still.
0x90A61665C9CDA8E79E6B9627D3F97B04

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x2A4640DD3C4AEEFE317EDB3002429808
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x22C622B5525AA4F8DAE680136CC21202
if you perished here of want."
0x5CEEB4610EF5C50BE259544128A5A014

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0xF919FAFD1811C0F34242FBB0DA171F51
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x838815AD6A3EDAAED2956663F7E760FF
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xA41AF863FF93928DBAB110A8F8C79047
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0xD1E5B1A41992503308F3AB395A7F9A4E
to the door.
0x1BBC46D30B28840EA978D3ACC5B6E505

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0x2B88F3A4976F455953F2DFEC0AC41455

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x453367E9C5CBFB569EF10DA678C4CCD2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x4E374407548FF4121678068D9228DF51
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0xB2AA535A78635FF2818A66E52A24BCDB
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x29F9C3F224F28D91C154640E29C32080
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0xA63A54776C7D80DC71DFF01DA18CA174

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x35681D5D1A6B4BB60554D83559C5D952
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x77561349E96433D44DF1E00B62774E25
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0xAFA984A9E9AE574E471AF566AEF6265B
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0xBF56F69C28C4FBC5B4DDB2D4989E646B
house."
0xD5CA60E2F5708FEBC019157BD42B144A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x381C320C1016A924A6DA89ADCA31C533

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xC2FDFEA76A987CDBFF43B9E23DA42C6E
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0xE2F31A817FE6AC690C881919F25948F8
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xD08F44E827D50637D54F5D47613ACCEB
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0xFCF6417E17EB773603CC14BC76588609
me.
0xA809552545BAB0B7982C5C268CE94848

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xE88D068064C537F175757C8EAFBA1F34

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xFDD70589FFC7E91AE529DE675EB85309

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0x426E0D4F6711AD19C88F57A670BF84A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x8820150C411528199C36D39CD0182619
sit."
0x43604A3B4562E54BD7AFDC23BEC454F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xCD805D836B932E36AC42AD248D260811
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x8DED96DCB280F75143E3D4BFE57FA15E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x2ACB1819A4459625273C5DF1DDF16794
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0xDFA50E5890168DE60BF0C9D2B14C10F9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A mere spectre!"
0x5A66B8665A873B59AF4A0BAD93DB2F7C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x23CD895971F8DE12D1597FA640B51887

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0x25B77223B8D0F702FE97BFF4C7AA04D8
bread."
0x4954DCB8ADA6D6036E0F3DDDFAA01450

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x33CC2C7509C7B6DA8A693B32ED369FD7
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x6C52CD742B88461326765F2668D9FED6
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0xE4DC5FB6E574FDCC7B4B08453B982810
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x2E819CD700888202AE7C977DD2D032C3
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0x3D6F908559AF1447B5CF43F24C0F17D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0x2A403D9466DB059EE2893F5DD46EBB23
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x3A59B115213FB3EB3441887E25C3AC82
first, eagerly soon.
0x796C467A8C8C88F995397250FB4B3269

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x8F33113ED1180BCA96D20988068D4C6C
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xB3CC6EA92E5A9FE1C75E6D33789A6058

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x89C5F71896E5D23F4750959D8F743574

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x6E7D3D5404AB459C5E994B273219F6A7
name."
0x3264CB4EE8C070D6A4C96E12A2AE04F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x0181A439BAAEB62747EF65FCA36E2686
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x39CA9F9400C5E99FCD547BFCFA7E8A7A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x8AAB45C78E28481655BFC00A0749A13C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was silent.
0x8A81ADF2220DBAAE289B7739BA96E4FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x55AE7E2EBB0929281BC4AE66C3036DE3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shook my head.
0x5189746C55571E2A7A7E23C16D70F5A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0xA1135E0E8EE6C4DC4EDCD2154B15B45F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0x6B85572C39E2874AFFED043B16152A29
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xBF30FF774D2661650A8F97289188D508
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0x12EE48E628B449F8523834C859C68B3B
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0xE771BD0129187D567C4D45A19AC1FB1A
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0xEA94E45D0194F7E7324D16CA07E1F8E8
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0xAF9D011E550A6AD546DA29952532F538

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x97D21433FA107EC34FB74A91D180CC42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0xBA0F2F1A53307F520DB04D93E12DE026

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0x3F53C35CCB0891A3A877DA6440A3142A
took the word--
0x5A075FE9F790BF5289B9DCB91B0AC540

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0xECD01AD39565A782FA0B6B4C92DF343C
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xE6505054C07FB144FEE7423374543DBD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x3A795448BE9FAB255C973A977E553B64
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x1FF3B922F3F041C106A1783A7D1EA6C4
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x9D40FCC00ED3586F22ACA6BD441DF342
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x2B17908CA3F7AABCC244C11447722694
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x7E0E59444FC4A4BC8C124DD37D9B7D2F
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0x67158F8B2A93F02F75EAA3BA2F566E81
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0xEBDAACCA217E711689397C96F90F831F
silent.
0xB9AD9AD18AA03A45EB1C1F752939609D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xA8C0BE663E736FEF45EC57C7AD45ECBD
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x5523ED291479E2051517252DA6AF9887
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0xE5C5C79C0269EE62A2E5199B68F0BABA
matter over."
0x6DB32917E7F7F72656E2A9F0F957D3D1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x2FB51279349AA3404CD95306F9C636BB
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0x1BCCD67EDFBE6E7B564F12E9C036DA62
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xFB6D59C555847AB7C0A3B0E4C637EAFD
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0x1D5DA192F14153AC34DB0D756FC299AC
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x3914A352FCBD664769C30B0A901828D8
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0x817913B994D6733786C4F5ADABEE4B81
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0xC16B7591A5B18879D1080BA095C55D4A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x2E770D3774BD8D2B53993F6DBD5594C9
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x3EAE0E7DA027297A8AE24E0374E5F5D2
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x721017205BCE18DF6AFD8CE691749E2D
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0x2F2732B4193CE797EBF1F883156FC35D
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x1A3F5AEDBBA3AAB3662CBD39D0CF9600
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x4BBE3BCC243D5F6A4F94322799254B8D
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x730C529CF2E8DB23730F405F928CDD6E
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0xD8A2DB45E55D404B68B117861A12A0E1
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x625BE2D70A448DD177E44DE2E5D62C97
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x58EC8125B7D75B2F2463D815C4C46D4B
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x6B145D970CDEE2C28C55705BF8DFA9C6
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x14033477FD3D26A1CDE9B6706826D01F
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xB5D316F4757C565BAA0E33B21623DF3D
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xF747E1A1C4476B41640D69070F735CCA
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0xD78C1E523DF46F63400EBD52FC4E1690

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is very well we took her in."
0x78326D102BB57F281BCCB5D19BF837E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x3744E3B29DB155DFA6927B8614FA00A3
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0xABAA4C66F51C1ED4DF515A08C8A86744

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x40DA0CEA30707904D9BFF0DEE5156021

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0xAA0630561B4DE4540E673AEB6BD0641D
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0xFB15773462367214464C05F050CB9447
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x7ABF1F10027C191F1754D11873117DFE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0x44454943705583E25F269A13D727A8C1
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x8D34CFF7E869454F51F7A4F3670FDADC
would be agreeable."
0xD4A3256D86F537F0FB07062AA650907E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xB8D2227FFDFBC4E170480B030DCA359C
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x3CEAD9E94A42174B58D6EF0F2A3B2DCA
myself.  I was comforted.
0x2B4FCEC23959D39311893455A2906989

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x0CE16139CCEA6289089140877D0F3DE7
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xF1A624E1A281A789F0FB7695CB90506F
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0x623C659AB57E17F00B5958168F740592
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0x15C206B8C3C3FAFE4730A2102CC24409
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x526DD2D93847B54E6C39D4B34FDABDB6
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0x1B77FFC105156BFDC49AB8CD681355D3
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x9DE8687245869B9892E41DA81B68F95D
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x9E951D6A224BA93DDDC2BBA083B4A7AE
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0xAF2265FD8030DCAA1CEE18A752F7F42B
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x7D53F1C0E759652747F8A2CF5FA36DB8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0xF8DBC8E5EDAA7DACDBAF71E5D85641CD
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xFF34310C039130FA404787D5A4AC5E07
her permanently."
0xE6ED0564B49AC25E48C769DE9C432FDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x9ABCBB11ED7A4A86276E65D4030A75DB
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xA6E27DEB8DA371808C7C791A297A6C63
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0xAC6EFF01996EC8D732516EA236880B83
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0xF9D049503A3DAC0B117EA9A1E760C75F
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xA6448C362F613CE92F818FF23FFC14F3
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0xC47E805499189D45BBA7DC47BFAD0482

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x8F5AEBD7359CDC108ABDEB8BBE414713

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x1DF9FB12182DF6F76FCBCD008C902513
are quite wanting in those features."
0x27A2E5496B351CB49C4FF4A0FB859DAD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0x35899A1271310E3FCE9A2890F07067FC
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x395CD9E975BFB43FB525D5A4F237E621
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0xA13B5A683977645134D278453730445B
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x5D1789B0E795B1AA8B47595F9922DD58
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0xA24340614C86AF7A0AD0B4C888673B09
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x6C64FBB2FC1813773D2E6E08CC52FAA3
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x0AE2A2AE3126F7C32D457B277DEB72EE
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xE66D380EE72D71D4164BBCC8AD550C57
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0xE84CAA7CF7893FB38574B7A858BD6A32

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x63FD4BBDE7E675AB886AC9E6D14DA27A
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xB2585E370121D7A89DA9D5FC48D11D6F
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0x1685489D92143E710230E4791F123DF8
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xF533677414CE272AFA628195FA97CF20
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x249287F4F555B0B18AF214012C4C1BC0
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x094451C136A6539B99747F26D1F0F6F7
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0xBB48ED3C295D06FCA118B85CBB47C62B
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x78975BA761383A8F185894B2082AC448
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x7D7F872D1A453580A0229FFF1C070B70
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x041E51146FE68CBFE5661B3EAAB54B14
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0xDF10DDA6F1F929C48F841059EE584A38
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x0D0B33E1EB4B1FE7226DCB8D7E1C55A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xE4E6025DBC6CD28B3039BCC7707C1481
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x59B47C8497966863D6513C54E7E3CA05
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x78ED3621BC96E1132C635AAC5BBD0742
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x81A4DA58CC760171110AF5EA46133A54
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0x42E6D905D6BCFC000A66637D02494491
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0xBD57DA45EB3B87B2EC07A3D1C318364C
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x3CD37644366669C5EC27006BA97ABA4C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x1B325C76673EDA00527337B53F0E9A5F
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x3BE75D8C5255C20DA0E6403CC937B8E4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0xCDBB7AF0B2766A0D49273FBEF2329EC9
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x91BB6F9EF06FDE9114323CDCB48BCC71
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xCCD2A7499B36AE2BE21634BB40413A89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x840B9C82F4F86EDFF928A9AF3DC4B201

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0x2E4A2ED3858FDFB4F14C96B403A7B93B
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xA0703CEC65C69A1B63D8AD6CEE8869B2
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0x91A4E9A0299BACB6770264E4C0263DEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0xB0F1F721722D28E354CAC53EB0C02BE1
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xA3A2A3080D9B00E54200E57D92B7CB1B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0xBAD6C254A90D408380825F30132E0AF1
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x6AB6A78586D4EAC94300E1239B0B2D1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x67CCEC0F7FA1080D74A5B7C9BCCE83BB
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x23445D63E14C1872D8F6EC3EF489E12C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0x38ECDF4E03BA83F2ABF7F0858D754685

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, very."
0x374C90E34BC635B0D9A0E4037F2D4013

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0xDE722E9F24A18CFFD7BC50BECCF3139B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x8A21071C29404AC515F4844AC21EBE5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x276DCAF6D5C37A5A064F58A68DDB0DD0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0xECB2CB5C807BF5837D8B1DA85BAC59FA
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0xFF86063EBDC87A49E6741788BEE12989
basket of the fruit.
0x5DD60A65F5E9A9296E910B75D8D1093C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0xDC2A7945AB1642B0F8200E004CB866FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x84FBC8237A474F6C568CB74E6433FE6B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0xE312344E9FE46A363BE4026C8C7374B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x7242CA78B70FB54D70DDF0DE6281BF20

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x45AF4F88D5C5FF23CA4C3C160CA352BF
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0xDE40B2CD886D55D1FC2329613B909D15

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x565332890527937B203C9365C86D860F
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x3805783B03A60868AF178689B64E0C38

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0x88BCF357D7AE6B5C0BEFBDEAC7423A51
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x70E507BF9D128D51AC9DCC6A3E14BAF3
are."
0x55637218CAD3A2DA4FD70D15BF564592

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0xD792E2F1E6BCE434805FFEB20EFD7502

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0x7DCDD8369E1325036B9C233DF6F8C11B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x23479CA779EF0D1DBC173E0AB1BB6EEB
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0x81FF065934825EF7C88800BAEE3BD594

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That village a few miles off?
0xEF02505FE634BB495253590DBD197438

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Aye."
0xBF8D0CB49A1D446A692AD4AA2E4C3E0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what is he?"
0x867C88E5E043B41D87BAFDC919EA3726

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He is a parson."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x00C5DA25C725F76C19AD813F5C9D949F
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x466B944DFD4AF59617C9E8B6CA49FDE5
residence?"
0x6F2A6DA31C40F036F4F823B520F02BF6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xC7111AB1305A5458BA8AD61038E6B748
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0xBEB3FEAA39CD812F824B001684B53988

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0x5813B5111DA3AB016169E4B43E2B017D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0xB113B912F7D9A0B252FC742B7670E685

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x6B85854B51AA5C74C6CC5EE58FCCAAB4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Their father is dead?"
0xA242DA0227A3061475664CAEEAD16D1F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They have no mother?"
0xEEDAD8BA72962E6435FA395D0CDBBAA5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x7094F96B675A90CB4B6CFAFE7F02B041

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x6E7BEBDA297425EB1101A8B4D3C98818

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xE17234DAFD50106D3E3E61404A89C5FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x85CDA5FA7F9C1925628B54B818A6383F
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a

0xFD7FE6045AB70FE9A149F713771A95B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x74D808A7E93206888DBE29E2D43B3F6C
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats

0x0ADACBF9601964FBC79CF013FA47241C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from

the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x3ECC5DB2EA0F096377696030DA30094C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'

0x99FE9246F4EF0F0BD1D59599FC9E9984

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x98A5B039F38AE1287DEE293CD89C6BC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0xA2D039339D7A0B0FB30043D461D078F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xB0B027D8794E2C1EFC2FDF1E14BC87A9
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0x56D72567F66D78EAC954A06F2523486D
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0x8248D6B96A73543F8206802214F8A515
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x3CAB360CA666835050F67B1F797B046B
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0xE6CA3BD1697119029097C051C464C140
to consider poverty a crime."
0x79C53E722AC5249B77B8A34E9C4A1FEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x4F14285537C09F765D3E3846D65A998A
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.

0xB5A1D6E25B065E82BC81DE335D12E069

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x2CEAAE46F88EE90EC512F9A1DBCD7B1C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x46E78508AF880E2DE95A92232CA91A5B
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x74BB56646601C1AC06CA192CB675A0F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xD15CE8C5920D3A2FAC277EE3FDE07B3E
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x9021EA206229B3285E2EA3F473D8845A
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0xF6DCD8CA55735A7D2EFBAB8911D02785
the young people.
0x0E872C4901AC2F4855AAB1548A14D1F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0xD57B75DC4948D11D1ABC6354E279DFD9
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x6F995075A48F39B78DB090967F0596C2
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0xCEAA43AB7F0DB119A05B5AFE125A697F
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x43B3AAAC289DBC6A52109FA9D6DCC5D8
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x78E25845A703D0DAC8598B77A70B338B
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0xFFDA3D431B03C1E918933AD359E62552
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x3F7B2F028CD894836BF7BEC879E5A8AA
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x03B55E73F06EE22DABF1A2481319B7BF
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x7DDC7847BA789B0FDB6E0B2EA6AAA5BA
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x108CEA5C0EB8D8F47EE85E866066F249
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0x641FBD455A7EFF18ABD155B9A938086B
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x95C0C96882A7111E9EF513967C06FB42
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0xCFB6A209455A075B3709F6E20D06E7AD
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0xFBEF14B7B75AE5E6A59DDAACFFE04E4F
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0x65F1A16C6B37B97F827116ABF79EFDB4
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x3A123A4D5A60FA247CBEC31F6702B338
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x6C8E2D1C50320DD1E8632DC661B3E18E
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x187097A4E4035C8B815E3DC26F036016
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x81C8999750A6665E2BDE0150A7F748BE
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0xCEBE58691AA474F1A993A0B8157A1C9D
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x33B14C8ED1FF12265C31287FD0A79485
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x28667C47E67D74A5EBE15E0F3375EDE4
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x7836A56BAD2C3DEC7A2CAD30E1CEBDBD
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xE4D51E2FB69F61C9AC56C4317CFE752D
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0x168443BFE32AC02C4200BF035F2DF3C4
for being united.
0xB320E5D5419900EC74550A19610B77E8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x83B252E6230A02D319C46B759A38DE44
ladies and their brother were now.
0xDCA39E77E546DBA65C3308EA3F6DBD5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x195D911A1E0E453D2FB41CF1A8B864F9
to tea."
0x41472184B814B7C9466A555E3D8354D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0xD0E1ABD7EAEADA07A2CCEF881AAE5FB8
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x24EFDC3EFA67D6C2A9FA320B1962C897
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0xB9E7E9F3BDF550F3AB43BDA5591509D1
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x283CAC74031E45C65568DC50A037E577
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x684321B6E60C028017A304DDA94288E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xEA72558ECAB757D8EB21738078445125
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x96BDCEBB5ADE95EB18C37016B9A927A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x5C197A3BF111353DCF52C325841CFFC1
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0xD72C469091E172E0721E7AD2F51F653E
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x5BA163155C3AD5C3D1230CCA8AA338E1
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x3EC2DB47E72264B25D864BEBA544BFE4
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x5FA5C7BD1931B74F10AE33323A8843B1
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xC3ED4AF823E146B358B563ECE0D455D3
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0xE27D3E72ACAC77BD84C52C79C9A27160
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x799950BD1A7A70D97419AD9B73E2A1C9
will.
0xF859E85F19A41D8814CC4C525CF217D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x008BE71D2C4CD5F64BE030B9C6AAC477
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x25354B1A1885B5BD327F584E398F3AD3
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x3A2CF191E7C00264DBFB9566FE5D029D
parlour."
0x104C389DC895EEF45FF109CA879B121A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am very well here."
0x7E3ED299C96DB180291A38297D14A796

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x6BC5BA8B207AA0374B95545567B725C0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0xB55AC981AA213589BA61DEB4F7EF8AFB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x1C0309CFD044058135168A4CEF2921CF
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xE4BBCBB23D600E2AE559CF599DE4063F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0xCAD2A8015C9E3F1AAB737FC5DD05136F
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x363BC255AAB71C9480B82C39D708CF75
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x239643F01334F6CD541CA811CC63C417
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xFBCD0616C4FCDB909949BFBBED547C7C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x4FFC39A14903450DA2EF899106A2E617
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x49D0AFC7E05544D976C3B89B8C6EE07D
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x65FA8EA807C3DFC8E653AB4774063ECA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x89BE57851D98D5B8BDC84B5AEDE8C92F
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x8AC593AEE04336EDFACB71EB0D650459
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0xCC6B4FDA48A6EBD43FAE7053BE74C670
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x9575E3BBEE443EA61DCBC0483AFBAEE5
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x1E93070E487DB4BD9121BE80ECDDD868
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0xCCA76B3679069A909061412F9AD9BFCB
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x78027CEAAD3347A837AC82E8E2847D2D
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x6C894B08DDCDD6C4E893D4E9E1D0F8FE
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x0D7959BCB726910BFAE81D57CDCF63DA
and well saved.
0x044918CEC5D502556C60A026D7807E9B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x71219739B365C38C293E66CBCBEE03EE
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xA64B830C38E45C73D3ECD1473C5AE3BA
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x8770F71F02703C43A13629E48D46760A
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x43EF7A152919D92F3D703B99020E1ABE
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0x356010130FBF6B72FBFF5F8466BAE778
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x299FCD9F70654681A3AF72712652F22A
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0x1F51E3B29DAFC58F3BFA87EBCACCB530
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x7B856AA9511446A540A686485D91E1C2
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x67F6B33864CD9281A380B9AA9C0B351C
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x244501592368DE1CF754E409F7C1B533
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xA73EFE4192DA1F72C3E8A6BFCC76231C
fair hair.
0x7F4D918506A9B584814CFB34B92BAA07

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x5900591E82AFAA48F1C81EE92ED7E9AA
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0xBED8FBC8F7506DC7759EE82C1F52497F
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0xCD5372789F55656FB851111E774A5D32
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my

perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0xD96A9FADCFACEB78D55F828942C8B01C
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x2E69C32272CA647F56D3CFEDC8D52E6D
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x57195AFDC41FF32A37A2F26CE236B2DC
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0x4CEACCBA1D80897A7B1E439D92091877
of the oven.
0x69C33AD81F06857E244F32C708A9CE75

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x1D0E2404544EFB72F289484DAD2526E0
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x6813621D636CE0BF0007446EE2AA211D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0xE03FBB7BE7CD41CEAB9DBC5442ECC9D5
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x46AB0B392218623123427CD8E6FD1372
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x7EC8DB7EAA3F34EE3DA59589F2E3B9ED
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x47C016F335C640DB4A048543B4606E4F
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0xB8098F529E6A00AB79EA083C037AFB27
from the stranger.
0xBA0F1F4400C9AE05707FB40F78A8AE03

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x0963C9277E2FF64448700CAFC31439F5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0xE5C3C0272F211DBDD85E9C6088F2EF61
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0xD6C64253100A96D7CD70816FE15CB392

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x40B9370FA9A6F65BDCA5107D66CF7295
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x48D55DBA35F7A72A2D279E583E7DF340
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0xAC53D31F98709567F7C05D076C97924F
immoderately."
0x1AD9B5A227528CEE5A6D433BF2933AFB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0xB433B729C15D972C5FD9F0D0A017E8A3
contrived, unpolished answer.
0xA43E53C1A1037D589600CE39FABF0B40

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0x5A958D2C8FEFB436D0065E400A0A5815
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0xCD1A8276E0BABC68276B64D5E77F1607

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xF101AEB9F8188F2E4F3501189D5E68C3
absolutely without home and friends."
0xACE85FF0CEC61CC1C7E44238B39B2863

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x1EDE02860A5CE49C3FD68E5DFD3A082F
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0xAD0371A8F2DDF069F5FC554570BBC64A
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x4A9D4BC2A1627FCB3661F249445B6142
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x91959B946E0ECE5AA8AB7635D88D5EE1
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x932E8F4180A0E701C54B6B5339285465
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x3D8390145E7C534452A14ACDCAAFD066
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0xED7B9A746A452727478C7305322707D3
to encourage.
0x165E81852610CDB874776D4138BFF706

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0x10B8D657799570698F89F165A872342D
every connection?"
0x72B986E2FB7B91112E90FD4F7A692892

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x956A47892985B959BFCFD6D9406D30BF
to admittance under any roof in England."
0xE16E733042C3C4330501627BB9F51A6C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A most singular position at your age!"
0xD61400F635825AE69FA49D4987839662

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x45FEFA826018601CECC9626180528087
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0x17AFA4877E607D06BBBD1B1B13AD061D
explained the quest.
0x9DB0664DE265991B5FC4D611387ABB84

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0xA1FA5437D87E793959C73ACFE229601A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x9E43880B498F4A9F451E1B83332C30B0
St. John," said she.
0x490C8DC66AA578F23D2A7878D0FA96BE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0xB9A0D361AD1E41F2FA74C45D76FD4900

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x5E63DFC00AC3F9185096C187A2F12BE5
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x1EA56AADC8FD6FDB48E55C32BFFD2252
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x420BF70900B676770590D409A3862B3C
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0xFA89DE93CAECCB0897D50F71879ADF45
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x97A4D515CBA84C3F5CF745BF53E61442
out tears as well as colour.
0x388BD0311BE7F3DB5762A13F29CD67C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x59A000E86A51DABD65DB6084B792EAEC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x854DC3030FECCBF1DBB2349E3376067C
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x8E1611E68333957937BACFD822F216F3
piercing look.
0xA902BEBF7D09648605022EBB69DF6A9A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0xBDE8A68CBAD7339F1480899FB2152F81
secret," I replied concisely.
0x3BD9203B9F01471CA9C51CCEB3E74A52

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x167BCB479E6A0472D880E5FE34FB141B
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x5E15C755CA7B8CB95E6377C1CA422418

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0x2D6302447552B3A807C23AB9B872D457
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0xAC2E67E50A4B1F206EF8BC76FB462F9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x86A75F44F07FE2C72E881D39CEE7B334
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0xD2BBC454633D84EC2F3B29E90A960EE4
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x97A7C1EC90AE439E5A376D576E5C5761

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xDA0EF5BDF535E239212FB0B48F151E9E
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0xE2751516007D886D034A8CF0D048995B
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xE81E07B6F942F43FD77090E5DACF8182

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x4EA2FAF9532FBA5182317F753D80DE2C
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x5BA7B7DF9B6F2DC3C4377026063863F7
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x7BBEF50FBD7D74EDBBA23DD741596E49

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x7DC5C05D740DBB89BE3BF2594C9D890C
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x10428275BF688731F02F6091455DE208
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x6E4198F48C11E3998A973809C782F57A
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0x0CE4C36B4A2B5CE3F6ECD269E099D8E3
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x7BBD30B5A335A1C438B828F6A571C6DF
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0x59797372EBB8B67E4476C9A2185C120D
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xAA045D5C15B3860F1D1DF15E3C14A076
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0x88037E7C831AAE9FE0257DD11E2EEE7D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x59913E8D4CB832C28BEC906A6316FF0A
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x0CFBB5FEA158963008D20D738C2A9AE2
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x74BB91E7436A77C16ADE553FE05F5153
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0xAFDB3029262A290AF4EC3F27417A43F0
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0x71AA9F8B45F6A71C3ED0A891F6E1CCBF
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x40A582CD8F1BEAD338EE3ECE029BC62F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
0x89791A601B4531281F9CB48BA6D34090

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x139730A81B0E6439E84F8F1873D0DDF8
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0xE2E2A394E523233865B47298B178B491
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0xB1458BA6063D6CFE99B92E0C053DF7A3
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x395B5D732FC7D2EE85136D8BD9AAFD32
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0x8676F8BCD2DB69FA714A66D127EC0092
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x0CDCB6DD23DCED12C5FFD5F553700FA7
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0xBE1DBA93082E836ECC16069C2B9BE0AD
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x7A084AEEBB7A2C64BC7F17A673C126F9
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x5699AB4BCD6FF257E2BE7FF81B4DC530
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xE26645F2CA25D07D5B42ED1497AD9508
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0xA2589E4FDA8569FA01D54633B0998376
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x86678DD51E0298219DB74A9041D41CF9
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0xA0F1012BE8100B45289262A0C25ED0D9
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x88B6DB48F993161E221F2455354B3B35
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xB40613B2950D048401F601884BFDD432
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0xAD8408C947A131EBA31EA93F847E25AA
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0x08589D7C8F7B3F2C054A5838728AC7E2
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x626A69E7B0EF6AF2F3C72DEDDC4FB2D8
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0xF65100B6D397CD4D911806F44AF00F79
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0xFDE23DCDA96CE88718732FFF76F63116

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xDD36688833F57809AC2F4F52B9CD498B
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0xFA10B7F010F66AECFF55420BE606C135
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xA675EE46C9E6BA4470D44260CBA7AF45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x033469FEAC3488B93DCA77ECF25121B9
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x661A60EE7A2F11FCEC2602A92D05A9E7
once.
0x30ECE53C6587AB9F7645C80D38CA3D78

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x2DD40482988F92F204B57F5E9C1769F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x4EB807DB966B8DAC9232E72E4C25172D
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0xFD0F030731E81E4D22E8792423C94DC8
sounds strange to me."
0x50C07A0C5FC0ADF5774D6736B31B0523

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your real name you will not give?"
0x4C444A2AAAEE396963F9CB84B883F038

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x2526ED5F7A87635345D8AE342623EB7D
lead to it, I avoid."
0x64F00BA45D19D2FDC3476C6C0F729722

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x3B9A86A2E72A3015CC7416F6E7B1168B
be at peace a while."
0x5EC568D598129A5C9535469451052558

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0xFCC5EECABD4FD7A6AC14E9C8560633EE
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x9E1B6F88C7EC60E47A48390421B44EC6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0xCC8E9ABE617CA54B46EA2549A336A6AE
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0xC6E663F736D5061A438D4674C101C35B
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x4512C2618B5BB121279920D18EE3BC1C
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0xA4F96D84B4D1FECC6F58B691901014CE
us?"
0xF2D7AD372E7F5A6D726D838E1A735887

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0x16C812099C067A64C70960754EAE1688
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0x2BE9392D1585AF253F8C60B01698BA95
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x936A771BC6C2BBA49D70AA4F85AF4ED9
the horrors of homeless destitution."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0xB1A000AB27C67C809E80DBD95BE19B19
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x0B3CD95BC55CCA96B791120D1866158A
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xD9F78164BC4C697D4DFCBE3ABCF9E9CC

"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x5DF4BDAC8D2D1F0B963EF547E1008355
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0x8381BC104E852CE300C3B0A46D16C745
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0xED891B3569FF2760FF35AEB686727EE0
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0xBA80624AA067763A57956B993BA010FC
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xE548316C0A26E9010BA07CCD3B69942E
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x5028DF9FECA2E8EECF1EEA9ECA372150
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0x56625E916EC6B17F917076F0E2F7B8B5
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x21BCE2E521B6DBDCE399A6D1656F3197

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x973B544F9AD20A3C12052829015E30CC
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0xE3D3DFB901AEC0217E1431166432123E
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0xE2B6DFA4922B83381DEA7E9F63A39CF1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0x970964C7DF76A18908C2F113C27CA4D4
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0x5268675DC3D4A35D24529855043FBF38

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x46B71D51386F65C542AC4D540DBBAAF5
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0xDE5462D5237FB90DB54F7B57B43A38ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0x875FAAF8630645AAB39C1F67F9CAEAFA
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x8B98A84ABF4C9F18C2298D23096E3075
present strength would permit.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x46D108801BB5F1828F23D5F868CB22B5
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0xEF8C2DE2A4140D973F5E5FCFD59E5D99
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0x7D447DD44A5C5669657676BA8CA7AF1B
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0xDE2141DB36417095A11EF22A96368487
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x27EFCC78590884F4A7E6B372718B4AD3
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xC00444D33BE2B0FADF6C933BBE16A98E
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x93ED5350AB2A51857562F050A8DC62C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0xA711D3347FDBCB7D7825B330CF6F9A2D
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x33DE4FFC4CDABBE5A8AD80C01E2051BF
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0x752927CBFED483DAC2A234DEBF9C5221
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x9462B67609B633FB198C7FDB185819BA
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x2ABCAAD41960AB34DC002841B5300850
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xD35C7A315C8F16AEC643BDA1AF2FD967
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x86B461126676CD5A0AF3FB1C64F8F52E
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x930018E587A3E24B1391C8817AE95CE0
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xDDCB85C373D4CBC9EBA4138CD27BBF09
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x7ED0663DD3CE7BD53F63E0BFEC44FBB1
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x3E1E66E7845D72948A0B1242EB788D69
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0x890E4F97FCFDAF94BB7BCC82F3C87F39
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xF5163D6840FA8ED8DA49C2654F418803
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0xD3BA83D6C01B5509E6A07764C92D44CF
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0xF46C794F6B4D937D1E7B58C828ED80A7
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0xCC68FBBC19F350C33B07220BD038DEF6
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x18858E8AB29FF412D16D38FA4F339813
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xEDEF8DFE5DEF015EE6AA8DEC55FC9FD0
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x3B1E1FCB9468EDC327CB625983DA779F
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x43A22C733B3FC5C5D80A6CD56BD3593F
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x5995316EA258B4726D4BC7DBB24F17C4
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x486D83DC379D0E52A5320135431BA305
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x9272C9776E5F3FB826D762503BE9B388
that entranced theirs.
0x6574A83DCFF6CF8F07BF80A0C74DD18C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x3F4C9A700DFB57F6F5DA94FC90427B45
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0x069A30124DBFFDD47B0E7487C43B398C
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0xED24101CD3D35BDB22F4BDF56D59ED73
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x706C1FB0CAE916519CB83BF97603D896
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x2CD4130A767D556E4B3C283ACFBE78C8
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0x72C56FA2B4F6C880DD26DA7B2959F63B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x80FCCC91ED9FA893CF6EC9F78FB4738B
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x194B619C798812548071400D1B93C345
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x9D6E183930F2652D43CD7CCEC2682627
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0x4DF6524A7CAAB95266790DD18F952B25
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0x297433A827EA49D048BC786C3B13A47C
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0xFF5316C346F04A10D7A557FF18895DA0
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x2D420993593D5F2E4BC4DD6D2E7FD530
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x4AC216CD50BDDA823F7BAC565A6DD2F5
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xD812BD592BB5A73EEC826FBF1E1284BC
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0xF6CBFA96D3CD7059A587E729CB167C56
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x1DF64627A899CBE5B23A61D8BA842D2D
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0xC97E788678A2E707B44FA182B1E4CEF0
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x3132B539B9D5C263F956B1131A8A496D
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x406C33CDAC1ABA0073C91AC47412F080
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0xA465FA95AA60961CFFEED9E0FB68CED6
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xAEF569667D0B9C234D551E526AE92001
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0xD741FB6763F34DC22E45857A24501233

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0xBF5D6B856CF90421096DE1C499E4622C
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x0A939DB8B09CC6121198EB405C69876E
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x80C3787AC3F593A8F7068B029D96EA44
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0xB3FD0647EA086C14BB1A1CCCD12DC556
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x15E3AACD6299593078BFB4F0BBB184B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x591A7EBF1C654C5698A4A45EB107C64A
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0xC8BB59DC84FE42A0B6050F501DB80A0D
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x106DF64D879BD376F8468F24F7DC5EDA
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0xC0EF734AEF55E03FC9CE102D3FCBD92A
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0xF7ACA27D71260D13A0F2F3742DF95E81
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x1430C4E5A40989C0C787C8FFCCA68503
cheerful--
0xD0FE74F0E0858CDE8C2432CB17333045

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x47FF50584CF04BCE2B176CF2F32F7CE5
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x768F51A0FDEC61D485A4C479D9274F61
propose to myself?"
0xE8541E2C1BA9EE45E0A196FCABD85183

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x7028FD6AE4B72FAEB6132B9A31301A08
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0x5F30D4E6F5052A31DDD2591B7C012DDB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0x407FD081F14A9A17D99506B8582FBF4C
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x8DEC93D5B0C83B5DEFE0D5AB1D39C0F4
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x4757091C54EE365A06E651B98E7DE5D6
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x00856C4200F43504FEFBFAB517041396
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x368BE0B922BC6282FDEF14A915627D4E
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x6A9DB1E9408ECA01D2609CBAFF43A482
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0xB003FA554BEE3C82DB328CCEA8A77969
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0x291ABD32160115DC942DAE0993B99954
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0x021F4A52DB91B94D4E016F9448E825CD
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x87814124946C4F21EF97BE22A78D6C05

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0x83D18F3510DEF646366E3C166E3E8F32
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0xABDA2A4DD126ACECA7B08E11B36DC112
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x90F44FD2C2AD3EB8C787AEA2869861D6
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x07708A99B27F5C6A1EB3620239C5CD52
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0xA5DC5FF34221C7F8587866D8A5EEF411
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x93C9551C85B20A9AF6FEAA6AFAD1A291
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x1759B0A70BF11F69072B88106F47BE2B
delights they could yield.
0x2176EA392D1361EB39554AAFE3659967

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0xE3BAB2BE79A2076B5749C89BE8D42077
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x44152B1A65E5647094D5C388F6A1BF67
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0x537AF0A048972299D15644441F805BD5
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0x733F8B3DAF5EBE9CE39B96A0A590B210
produced on me.
0x562F1F3C1DC23CF7E5A06FBACBE787CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x857BF5CABF1A9DCFBC5F26F681F2A290
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x7CE38ACDFB315A36A6FE17516C01EAA5
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0xCA3AF171B49231A13375C113718026E6
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0xFD55274F694F5B47A8AC9DF1862BD6B7
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x6017525B28331DA23FF9F5EA4FF1F3AA
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0xDCA013ACC5D6FBCC10B2080B88807B5F
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0xE36B50ED11B2DF3A47A6610409D6B84C
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x293385C7388A4A11785A5DC231BA3D3F
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0x51C7F0E3AB6044B18631D7C143BB22FC
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x116334A55E5EBE5D09A7E2C3D3859161
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0xCC036BD5E778A16189498648E4088A1F
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0xA56EEBD2BE1A87A32759509FE3957B93
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0xBB6C83483F86CC3EDCD911EC4DD7FD47
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x5B4EBCE31919ADDB3FCB6E6A3D75078C
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0xD344203D4DC942D3FBEF82BDFC59F468
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0xC8E2EDA484C66879FF8A43A32B405732
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x9447059EC4B88F41F004E218C01BE68D
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0xC7E167FE3EC79E7F11E3E199CA5921BB
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xD48EC381F686CAA1AB6343C1C5842D3E
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x8FB0BF50628C8B25405BDB4E4076AFDB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0xEE5EAC9428A12E9DB63AFC8D503CD837
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0xA6CB4AE1E9B1FCB59EEB825C947FB354
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x0BCA2573635A228BEB2BC0E2CCAB64DF
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0xB258046026F33D059A0AC69522B60756
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x79E9957614970D6DD924DCA0EB958A3F
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x74EEDB5198114E1A6C69543CF7D8CA6F
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0xF4030A68468799E6F9B2A7A09D2567E9
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0xCB46DC61DAB56AAE9602405CC1ED01B8
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0x74FA515801B2C8BFFAA0C802F77AF763
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0x47128EC81DCD99621745E1CBD55E901A
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0xD01A2CEF17595F903AFDEBEAC568E568
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xCAFAD740762BA0B704B0D2CFEEEE2F7D
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0xDCCE98AE0F73A8FA8A3D0D13A4D9FAD9
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x22CAF098594D3348066853934883C0FA
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0xF48074DD49BC82694CFAA511FC55EC7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x45E723FCC4636F3FBA56D63073C7DFE7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x05DAB1670FC6A7DAE34BF9B69AF49CAD
myself to undertake?"
0x4DAE1F57292B8CA339F2DE69FFBC6CCB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0xF001EC682545A246805366D32B2FA75C
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x3110BB0320ED7E89C6A4533809C94964
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x4C2C62B657DFC57F378D470984586428
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x01B9692F19C09FED5054153F2D3210EC
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0xC66A72A56FE0E986686ABE92C5F9CA61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x6A723D834D3FF895238C993C6CBC15D9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x29163F4CEF12AC539357AFC78596DC33
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x78ECF93314B7A9F8B16905218FA1D2DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x892D5E81208D02C16F9FE1A1380BB6F9
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x50FD08940A981DF694E28C5FA2D4CD45
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x37D01535FD1BB6151E645B40049C8296
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0x087F8DAFCD878857F03A61FC002802A5
interest to me.
0x706D05DD28E261BABBC794546541C9FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x10C4BCFC762126BD21B12EA8C86DC8B4
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x9BD483DDD0D7F9EA19ACC068825BA750

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x69BF265E9A580693C964CFC323084BF9
you to accept."
0xB706C506D785546AF4D3950FCE1A6639

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x3846F2455829860AC10F78A2065866CC
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x06C291806B941AD432F635917E6D8A47
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0xC409EDD94681AE685A93F1170BD610E1
could have done, and with less trouble.
0xB07464487955EE07261FF2B1274363FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0x377903D91A48CB15349B88768C47A451
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x2C53D2016DC8C8D4002F0C862FDA9DAA
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x39AE2D7C517802721F85D6EEF6DDAB36
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0xA3F4FD6D128BC916BDE171320FD4E80F
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0xC407628D3D41B119857683AA1CFA74C5
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x33BC193B331EF3AEC98A3B6F35EFC12F
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x68AA0A9D68DDC643CC80E73D993AE2D6
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0x4E9312C72B7F1647759EC4B42D6EBAA1
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x7ABDA22315C78FF91A1C567D59A07818
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0x4280771EC25002D56BD8FB1EEEE1FCD3
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0xA46D77177A479A783C298296F04A986E
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x4470FEFA54D86F01780A5BE4D5531C89
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x0F8EAB73C9E2AF8FA775F56EE919AD79
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0xD67B7FF0930A8EF48D3B5F4C32A768EE
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x626C4685028893F18EAB42C5D7B7F66F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x2E8EA43F83921A84E92DBEB7994DDCC3
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0xA9E80209AB199E162ECE80EBEE8E5A97
glance.  He resumed--
0x14B5DBE2A28D691B67A461BD605A176B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0xDA4FADC421DD09CF24D80FBE250AC3EA
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x23EF2AB4A96A456E7293CBBCBC727C91
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x430504F38F248D96F245CE25D9910B96
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x764D6CD493CEE9589344626C16BB1EF1
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0x16782EEA9EEC80FEE651A366DBE09D14
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0xA027511A222AFCCEA4D5E04C50E8F4B9
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0xDBA2B993A084A6EA5F9474E2BF0156B1
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x0D353AA8C26722BABBE60B31069F30F1
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0xB16E9DC5F0E2AC9609446BEC816F6B6F
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0x70CECCB532BE28876D821AAAE6DD66B3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x2416C75452B784151ADC2994D746622D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x996BEFF1A62666881CA1D34916B055A4
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x86AB4FCE60AA3797425AB8ED75AFB7E1
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x90D33A64399CC03EAFD1F08C54245DB5
succeeding observations.
0xB484A37B3620F8632261F3BC0637892D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x467BBB73DC468BACF4B65BA125627BD7
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0xA6E15C0FD9ED40398561AB8A360DE747
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xB5EA064ED6E2A4519ADE837C4FACF72B
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x5657FBE2ED2C1F2738287DE95CF70480
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0xC56EB50475BFF344A08811D274B8D9D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xFE9A44D376E9034A78C88BFA5D50E97E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x7EC16F747659546B06333652EC74287C
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0xF79AD148EA9C7E4A262204DDD8DD4FF7
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x4BB304E21EE49DC8F826A91DD00BB0C3
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xF62E11EA55920B475BE7002760A295DA
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x1EF43993B0CB99FEE82327E570378D60
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x0169F862E16711600C477186E0DFD064
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x3AA5F33C06564D8345BD7E866659DF99
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0xAFAF74D7022DE8E43C7256348B9808BC
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xBE174BC01A1231FFC1BC1232220F7FA0
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x1681715C688AD5226C45B90C60A74590
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0xD999E9C5C3A0ECCAC80F176CBC7416CE
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x98E2D83C94EDE14B64164D5D318A2935
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x02266DEADE311A02A16D5344B218C168
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x09D81DC675044B8C59437A8946C736D4
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0xA12527518DA9139B8E7078F81F90762F
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x50FF69486A277D51B6B001CCEAC0960A
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0xD293A1DDC68AEACF7635B7DB4F8EAC61

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0x329153B2A2323E795E698D3D3B8AB129
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0x5E655D7BBD6594883FE9114375BFF0A9
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x0B540BE98E50A83D4583A3B1730091C3
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x9A0000AD2FAD6D75DA3D6EECB217F3DB
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0x40DE21EEE884E49ED52CBE0033D32485
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0xCB6938CDCAF2CE3D3F0B8249DBC7F2B7
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x079A59A8FE84384187494B6BA64C436F
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0xC0129F374DCA33A2E083D95C7630D923
decision.
0xCF9A877B05C5004274084DBF20244136

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x98CBB34921011249C5D9359FCEBF2A2A
heart."
0xCF66C82FB715DF5DE453840F5F7C1E65

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x393864CE6D950B314959DABD681BE665
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x88089414C83693C5624E883A55F041FD
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0xF797AABC514A2D95FD28DBE4BF249C45
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0x28EC50F1CAB22A1E9CB42AC906169DE0
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0x7185EC9399C19821C6C984B82E159179

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x1519134B6532E8853B79FBDA491470DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0xD88CB97D388A8B45C64392DA01B6BB41

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do."
0xD88AF1D3AA2D2B5DD87D18D46AD4CC5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xA9425BB4C683E170E11C0C6A2811931C
deeply gratified.
0xC898846088F26E62DA74ED7D15958AAE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0x5BB6A4D31CD3CD0D87DCCFB09B0E70EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x2FCB2C9B1C4195E6A07D71437E64BC56
week."
0x22A6499E56A1DA82B5232DAD0101582D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very well: so be it."
0xCCBA0BAAFF23D2A64AA62BCFAE972728

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0xB2042FB6F05B8B301C5F1D39194F7924
me.  He shook his head.
0xF98C04C778A155F2CF59C3C436BE3F87

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0x0FFFE7836F1A956D0AA23E255A0DE507

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x7CDF6674ECB3C944AFEB34B27610156B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x515E531353B85D4FE50AEE5848B17198

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x826FEB7AC835021A8D5A865E46360F5D
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x350A5EF96C1DC201C136FFD85EF0BB2D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am not ambitious."
0xA89746950FAAA6D77E29E79BDE262CDA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x4F0AF76D741B4D513CD4EDBBEC667345
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x351AB1B76672C9AD80BCF6A40FB84DDD
it out?"
0x2E3F1E36B429234BEE305FDF0578889C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was speaking of myself."
0x0D2C76DFE574D3FEA2047368D39D0546

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x8140285BCA60159FB2EDC776DFD68206

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What?"
0x40E02BE80EDEC597A35E243C1F880C54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x0F30171C07DBCF38706801E055A08CAD
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xAFC7DCC2F7D6784A6CFFC525547646C0
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x5E231C2900812539D7032184EECB4D48
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x4B860BDD5A0BCD38C61E67DA45126BC2
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0xFE8031076964AA57036CEFAF8B94BE34
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x0BA3CCA7EF3C09C481FF00C871373274
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x11A3BBEE866EE81F587055863AD868A5
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x925F4792DB55EEF4E20831EF763CE762
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xD98EDD25DEF2CD31E0878ED3A25BDA88
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xA18D643083BBE5EEEEFB4ED78987DAD9
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0x051D418A8530329C3EB605B571A6237F
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0x0F24E618803EC9D58EC5296CE3C1863A
some means."
0x42C9AA8C1D67507692DC9DBFA4008E52

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x7CE0B636698B2AEDC9BB7FB2A605823C
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0xB42AF4E0A3D65939EC64022903780B2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x39FEC01609E13FDAE06FB9CC1ACE38FC
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0xE2922D04FD6A1D339251DC8E21750A57
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x4623F70C2D27C78CCEA5F97CA0410B8B
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x18B2A21345BE855C7B5B4A5F1A69E064
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x1886DFDAD955A76127DA247373DBCDA1
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x75F4EB65E139FC32D899DDC88B711CE0
parting for life.
0xF0DB5A040B8C5559E60B25B6A7F794A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x05DEE7ED12BD80BA93648DB04F5F9CAD
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x4915C67D1A2F7F1D0A45A1A5B2714875
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xC56FF78776D6852421B167A13B190C69
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x126614BD036771FDFB4F825344FAFA50
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x4429156BB880C0F994113C0CAAAB521B
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x466B563F42C6428D5540E23AB3462CB0
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x1B46F490E7B7FF9D486B3B8B7C8DD177
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0xBDDE89E460C9A76FA09DD540C6E64BA2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0x493631940ADC583C6A2E392D8374FE03
she murmured.
0x20BA773272BD68F7D4DA02EAB7A0D1E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x7035787471FB8679847D228BD97FD7B9
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0xA19C2BE5ECADD9AE8B910226617B3ED9
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x2C3CFCC5E6E83BA45C1B9722584D22FF
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x42A58566E546C717CA3BB881FC6938AA
letter.  He entered.
0xF02CD66827A4FBF2A3DB564EDDFF1053

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xE8B325A38642B3CB0D54EB37A1F54E91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x6982C08A6C19DA33222A954DB91457A4
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0xB08D4E2364C0EC13F44717BAB991891E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0xA81D5D8ADDFB2FBF537CBC72CA6FB701

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0x00FE89E6CF2F177CB84DFCE35CD621C0
demanded, in a low voice.
0xBCEC523418A3CAA169F449CFD648B871

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0xC271D6730F2A5D91A15B1177CBD70E14
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x75950CF9321BDFC5CFA6333ACBE90486

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x606352D6DDB509B8FE415AC8D4EA59CD
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0x19AE1356ADF0DCAB853060522B95515B
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x1D7822F7D017912B5D9443A7F66B3F08
enough.
0x0F1A67EB318CC50547E0F68B15D5B919

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0xA10FDB8DE8DB15A3FCECADD6405033ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x053622E1B1E5E4F9D1D83E8543E13A2A
Mary.
0x749CEFA7136F741780AC98E419B250EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0xF30418247569361EBAE1D5CAB9A5C3F6
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x92E36A50023ED94F14061BB036111664
what _is_."
0xF95FEE33460F15DE2A045733FA44E2C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0xB75ECA3798A7CE4CC40A73765C7F52C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x549251DB318A0C0BA035B7726922C24A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x91F806BD17B3F06ACCDB8BC130A30FAF
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x3D7CBB534DDE23BE743646B5EB4B5ECE
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x24DA126D9B43EAC37A7DC0D6BDBCF501
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x900FCCB0AA472C71E33BB8935286C62D
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0xFC4CE9B557AAF99EB92D274C9A45EA90
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xD6435DB786176B9C6AED170FC5FFFE92
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x7D792AC931396399D377E6DF4239363E
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x1F59C5AE02A46CAB5E045BC657284476
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0x1BB20E8ABB4D87700C5A3B009E8ECC05
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0xFB61B8B40C15A3B97D99C0A588D5FCE8
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xE6E4F7755AC075B6AFED3260B965A87D
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x95F4B35D44410D907B1763E7F0BEAFE9
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0xE6AF45D31F3FF942DC6B6DA49C90531E
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x285C7B5920DA0F3F50ADDB871D247DC0
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x03605EC09D4E6738FBAF4956E425E2E8
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0xF1FB7A1B89785BC8E0AC00686CDC1240
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x85439B71FF95C116B93FFCE2E03C5824
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x49695A3A908AB6EDFF6CF5F25ECB89D3
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x59218C1EC9D96EE1C8E81349C3A6E09D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x41C65DC20B7F739C8844D1B6EA07E4A4
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0xAE96F5D832B96B58AA8416021106BCB0
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0x93190067D24CBA5516350C42E654E0CC
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x04FA9E25135B0D712856A65D4B6A37D8
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0xE9E9B2726146F96B7360B787DEE3BE47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x937F6CD9F1C19AE835D894B9C4966838
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x36B0413A69B115E3A45723BDD245B871
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0xC534F1D3D8FBD86DFE1B17EBC4DDB80D
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x740AEC581DD7639E3E51C1C29AFD479E
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x850E9E5739C8485083FD2C35534D5CC5
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x459E0850A53810A74472A044FF330537
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x8AABCEF99C529ABB3785ABDDDA60B9B5
things as are necessary.
0x555912B55C429BE5AF96CC44B014E9EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0x13D6550552A19FDD21B0E25C70904701
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x8AE69D429254A72B1DDADD14528F2CBF
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x2B851E40DADA76A228C5B40823A3D144
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0x7A805AD413913B47ADF226BB7E2A4319
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x006AF39AECD1C054ED91A8238036A09C
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0xAE7F9F32A2DA052582B92BDDF1D4CF4B
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0x2F95B77F60252D03A9C3ED073122F851
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0xE4F9DD59760E78C6A89345AC54ECAE54
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0x86B04DC02CB6F0D0690AF17CD9FDA764
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0xFBEA1C13F740D42473952AED3BC20D8E
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xA4FF1E56CCA20A28F91FD311EBF29B0B
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x72BD6D1646051A3C13FEF4A6A1AE3F4D
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x13C17CECA72AEE1D50E7C1A314B7BBF7
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0x50E4D0191836B7D556E69E7B9FD2D8B0
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x2FD6ABEC6F96D4602DAB72AF6EE24F0E
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x1702EAF45A538A94A9F32D12A4E40AC8
on from day to day.
0x8001D8C0CF1CD54370D25B6FC6425144

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0xD51BA52838ACCE605FC7250FF9127DB8
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0x5DEFF43766B26DB8E6CA2AE6413C6F1D
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x36C3F0443F2EE82C576794CF2B16C91D
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x7272191E1804F7EF7BF7D242A10E156D
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x127307DF4176A4937D9D6AEC194C129E
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x51F275DDEDED7D8CC244DA94D0BDAB3D
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xDFCF17EA1731807072533A10E850422F
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x973D10A303D1EB48FEF42540EDF865AA
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x79365B51DC2A2214183C4D0B2A274AD6
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x631AA9563DD65898B9134186590ACF46
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xD548F308D7AE6E89846CE942E7BEB330
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x784FE5F46217B08E7022A1C13A7812B8
gratification for disgust.
0x552FD6922B2BC5BB59FA2B3B5AFB74EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0x9BE01C00FBE99DF344F9FFFEFD7D10F5
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xA7CE22FB1AA18FF6C06930B7C6B4530D
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0xAA92EC01CFC51FC845CF1C049115980B
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0xD4F0C4E71FDAF38857419A068E5796A6
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x562543ED77731788A63BC23D3DB0B34A
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xE2699CF07D82085FD1F54C58FE21ED31
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0x966564A3CEE3566C5233C237D6EBD418
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0xF0C65FBA1544C8026EC9E8EE414842AE
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x138E2958E4864F31AC5F17491511A193
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0xD65A32DE58F3A16D48DA52655A5D387A
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x324BB3BAA1BFBB30433331A85422283F
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x388EF080DA2952AB244FB81287A4551F
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x1CCE0BC53AF5BF16E1B1262FE375B206
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0x79CE51D47837BD08A37524D332760979
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x9450DE05212E5CBA805E11C05A3E4FBE
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x294D6629BC99BD2BFFE04659D79C253F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x3FB16F537ADD080DE11C2256BC8544A1
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x94DDB61BF9B1A156D3975E87A927B17E
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0xDBB47CAD1D00C25D16CE7F9054A9411E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x5663D7C44F7EEF1E1290D056DBB588BF
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xEB20E5898F775407C91270667EAE77C5
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x1FA74C4ED9FDF5AF886D4BFC6F85691E
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xF9ADF8D27FA16FB666F1C4571717E0CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0xFFC147A8067B1B791CD180A90EA8D70A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0xE4A1ED62D6F01EFFCC2BA728C05672BA
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x753F4495CE76DA3C881A4928EFF98901
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0x26A4C4BF52A53FC3C0203A854C0664DD
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x23AA8AC01566863A998384F795A00BB6
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x6EEDF293381FA159BE102F2C260B4690
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0xC515012452DD218EF2C460DEB9E808DE
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x6534292836D0A5CB99C375AD416D9ED4
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0xB3A3DD3F7EE1158C74897980377F018A
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x9A1BA2B005CD3C84202D0B23939BFC2F
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x1F8C29DF554F21B5BECB721927CD4280
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x14D57AA877139B9EF9D3ECE950794DF8
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0xAA43B91FD8CB060744EAA609D694922F
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x02D137BAC4D1C198B112B5B7FE5A566C
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0xA1536E4A747853930F2FBE10CB762889
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0xF59926BEFD3A2D66678E2E3215BA38A5
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x5FF3BFF9F39CE98B0D7EC0E657D7BCC7
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0x70EA125BEBC415F7F443725CFAB805A6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x08F764AD5DB6530E1636C8F9CFA351DC
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x07A35E0FE04E1D6616E4881E072825E0
doubtless very visible upon it.
0xC4F5C0668644DC2143A6B86F97EFA4FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x2C1598CF8C12E79F66A779A2AEC107BF
asked.
0x50880505BD195DB7DC5D93C278D7601F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0x9BCAFF6E01073D2A5825542602624ACA
scholars very well."
0x7C46942BC1A17BFDADBC863C4B6932C3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0xA834982154525343EAD1D3BF1B1545E5
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0xB91792E518FFE1A2982078FADBFA1E5D
I interrupted--
0xDEBF091EE1AA1CDDB378DD00D335926B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x88C49FAC4820BC8439B7679E275CD41B
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x5933E4EAA42922A1D1463DBB8DB0A320
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x06DB486D3F3747ACFE20F49EA45D7A75
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x22084C4BA49FDD06840102F889804A1D
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xBDD6DCDA0CBBB083E711494E564C22C5
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x9B7A73559709D73F014D0F09BCF01BA5
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0x6E47024BBBCFD522FCAFD131188B9404

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0x68871E5BD0BBE538224DC26ECAB70815
is dark and empty."
0x6B1F0ABBED70A2C51BDC6337266F2380

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x5425484DD191CA19B2A14A1B343510EB
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x44388855B03BFD945939CE6D82FFCF73

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x38002513BA142679D3F64A7564AB48D6
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0xD59BA201E8E0157D65039732C078EE9A
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x1AC003BAE822724C8A37291E790ACE73
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0x1035AE47F560844A4F01552B00D0F343
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x5BD2C226074101D3AFA80FCE34C888BE
steadily, for some months at least."
0x037463620818F624114CF36B3EE7D365

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0xE8589F3C12204F0130075E34A3F885C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x6D84B69E67DB4F4993B5A8862B405BFE
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0xEBEF2DE077962557051CCF0AB83BD825
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x232863363154A2589370D8E464FD7688
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xDFE8B0E805A634194B74D7DFFE3CD3FB
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x6C95A2AE109572D88C2CDF1803C7ADE0
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xCAAFE4398001C1553EB899425A12DDC0
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0x4A2BE3A87490D770065067845986D79F
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x2359C1BD91837C335AC936C5E8C18FC1
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0xBA1C4708F5B296C9D801B61471A9A57C
rougher than it.
0x448D55E409F728FBADA7CF79EE5AE85D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x2CFBD032BDBFC543FD41282A78968B99
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xD243EC25B0CB41D6FB9A2DB2400A600D
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x850736A4C1B8B896AB21B7D1B4395591
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0x82A6D0E92B1211D290108031344BC7F6
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x8BA16D5F33BED661E194416EF73DA676
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x4989196154A8E3C31A832BEE8333A8BF
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x762B8F85E83230B64885AEAB23818441
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x85DAA5EDE6B9AC7901BD8EB5BF218DFA
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x9DE1A617915B11610E66D0FD21FB98C3
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0x4BF5250556533E15BFD1139BD42102E6
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xD26478968C92172E096B271003AFD4E1
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0xBC3298CBA735A275C11A24CF7723C790
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x08B130FD0025B47F23D12482E948AB04
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0xF12FE8ECC2BA5FA07198CA79C33E50FE
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x120E24F1B5582853D37005A2710B52EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x0C7F21912A05F2A171DD9FD62B26ACC1
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0xE380387EFF89C0A453546940AE84B7AC
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0xDC35297F26643F4C9F463336A4754461
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0xD03BDA30D689711F8C96C645539FCDB6
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x99A4C3E10EBB62AEC100FF1E0B49A3F5
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0xE67C681FE535F74CA564F38609637952
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0x31FB7D784EAFF978F83E3863900DE116
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xF74342A8D95C445214A6EF1DE0132EB8
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0xC9FD28DFC2F2B6024239DF8C0C47E370

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x497D305958806E8957040F8F6C270A08
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0xE1E879F1B1AB52674461FF43E5E50EB9
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0xA59D49EC9A9E9CDBCBADA0BDFA48E198
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x8202C35F06643F654027C708960B394F
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0x092272206E170FE5D9F94531DB879F66
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x165568388412747094AC36E177A01E68
exclaimed--
0x7FFEF23E5F9CC61ACAC26EB1CD3942CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x120A561B9370FA825A9B4AC6F3668C10
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0xC919B385BB4A85C718C6F778045A1B15
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xB6550C1AB2C410EB95C2722F6A4953EA
your back towards me now."
0x81618C72F162AE949DF597171309AD16

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x4882CDDAFDD9587030BDEAA687E4CC34
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xC4E68476E32CE39025883B485D63241D
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x0F0240A8061ABBA9D070E5C8139383B5
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x414091EE44032E8B4A72AB7057E64C9E
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x45C79933228F9A2472C8BC177B8F7DFB
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xD053E9001B65E2F63595E62835B6D07B
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0xFF6DA57ECD370D996CBCFB852E483342
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0x8D9BA7B5ABF77627B7FDD9F50E0D6E62
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0x17377C8260AF5A7E2BB10CBAC3628318
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x8F5F6ABC885D6E46760D0AE99636AB9C
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x4DDD5172122A1743FB41B64910FD38DE
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0xB79756D8CE2D706EE034D2150A9535B7
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0xAC92B3B22D0EBE0924B1A6F6B80E0805
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xC897C8C159FAF2143A78EAAB7133C74D
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0xD5E9C1725B3635CFBB2F8A63D6847A60
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0xA333206F299C3B708BDF9A00AD33030F
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0xD0921BAD2C8CAB268BEDB0CD60B9B652
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0xC51C7E3E007FFCE47730E8F7C8249157
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0xBEF6CE6965F2371517E663AC61FC1B35
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x32CB12348816BBFC9C08EDCBF825662F
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x47044C467F3E9817D97CEBDFC85E1E33
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x70451572C4F365D72F90833B89EC4B6A
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0xB73126727C01F1BA64378C47145BC757
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x1F2CC1CEB8E059D9F7664799ECEA2ABB
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x645A3B859FDFC54706888138E00F808F
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x0B178C26A36CA199F569B83C94BC15CA
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0x5DE616E36750B7F787D6C7E606524987

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x4A279E8A51D3592E16AEEA468BC9BEEA
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x38D52E1F430C438752A9C77431813D6E
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0xC9D773A0138EAE64EEE9093DC4359CD4
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x35E2AB68722AC7DDAAF6BD75D81E622A
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x7B5195904F1201EDD67A9A21B09D28EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x9C6B1C972D97C2C27F423832319FDF6B
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0xD53132F2A081BA87A7F42697154065FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0x72382EC246E276F700BDDCCEE9DD7178
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x7B80253FC89320BD50CE189FD463C639
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0x2625539AE735A34D580E15CAFCE6663B
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x6D872CFE62A9CBCDE5D24FBBE15DC27F
pointing to me.
0x03084A93F936607332740488DAA498DC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is," said St. John.
0x91BF4B09A3BE3130A8990B64EB3826C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x1F847B5BC0D1BBA5B923CF008654D31E
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x68F12946A59560BDD2A9DFEAEFF6C83A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x5D6BE2BE974686E25862F2D86DAC3519

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x69C7D27DE09365CDE1CA3615A8A8DBF0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Quite."
0x3C537E28A94382FA99873379CA84EB1E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you like your house?"
0xFC45B0B50DC7B00B07CA6E35D8B9DAFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very much."
0x15F1C69B19782EA0A6DCAE7E6E1E6F67

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x7FFE15CD019038E2BE2A7346D834BC33

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x38BC647A7B3EAB95BA1DDAB3D37D967B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x3AB306F307C722F28A4DE2204779D46B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0xF03926BCEE1F5FED0FBEC9ADB5BF5CEF
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x11A48E3C252F6C7695E866D65CD81EC4
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0x85B4E72A78DBBB632473C3CF5640C2EE
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xA1C1D50AE9D1DE624A359291C46A190E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xC0AC2C4D9E5EDEBC54FD8467702F916A
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0x1347A2515D21B91EA9FC64666F5F1477
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0xA3C085117A46F96D8E71523498810C24
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x2EC8B4D45473DD39D55A2D08B8389F95
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xA376F707C061D4ECC7D42632368D4B3C
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x02297C4C78B500E60E19A3770F84128A
merchants to shame."
0xBADC0E2ECF8D72C28B2D2C16E95626C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0x6F1839596D84E05E601B56C74D8C7C5E
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x94E9BF897757B189B57DFB73031F2744
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xFDD76D92E83348F68A579EEB7AE2649E
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0x0BA4D745A41650220C46B4455B1C8E0D
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0xFC1F27B2F7CB232C97CF8E5FD455E8F6
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x23872D7D80DED05E321E658B2D68E533
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xA99DFC544CF41DF5B5E31D0726FACE0E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0xC107023911C48049484FC9794F253B64
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x39A775157FF893C38E38305B903A17D9
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0x04398360CAC9E225B20D3DC3E5725DB6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0xFAC15E323CE1C48497B4B984B8D80B73
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x2BFD1C40E5EA5A867C3DB6C623E7CA62
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0x21CD377C68DB64D0ABBDF885DE3CCA51
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0xE343F60BA6F8E6A0A9453F0CC7E9E1ED
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x279207C602867E9C0901325CC145901A
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x11374B10950AE1000D8BB95979BE571A
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0x844D01111C50FB14924E28E7A8EC05F7
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xF0248C5D7CBB0F2F594B41C21D0AFC0B
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0x3C3AA0654F56479FF986B77047D74D8A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x338424FA9330209089E1A6CC483A82C8
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0xBDEAAFA18C0E9695C29AC838CAD17AC0
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x7BDABCD1D020A177B8A7CA31E97BD522

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0xFD868F9FA20696EA52F6572D16AC545B
John.
0x2844851A08D1D3D5C87B2E75EDD73AFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x6E7AF2BA3E7146BAF0594F69F47019AA
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0x1ED75FB250B224312BD981FDE5A92E1A
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xA078615B373B3339DA4916B5BE93A6EF
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0xA1B0ADB4B3FBB3C805E0BED664C8B9A2
her own.
0xA755DB24865167E1C81EC1FEB5575236

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0x43FA99039FCE9DE4096385A8008A69ED
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x219D13A49F972B503B55A1D96F575139
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0x05573EB107E4B8BF06E26531AABA2DCB
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x5CAC50CA86D37CD349359D628A36F31D
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x5B2E7977D0F4304FB634F8BEBB34E871
papa."
0xAAAFE5942E74496EF25F1A379D31DF62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0xC7C6B07BDE354A3174D79B01EA341CB1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0xBC027A28597B6BF9ABB2C4130B63B78C
it cost him thus to refuse.
0x2FB54B5AF122BB73F955F7DADBBBFB7F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xCB10EDE5FFF1E095AB39BFF421821BBC
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x8AE9B6D4483224273C82E36664C6BD63

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x0F6454B9B342E0F66E086367204B08FA
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x7007DC539819EA7C4D64A1099A9BA5A5
returned.
0x40593712616143F73F0A30353AC41B81

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x2D840514B08959913972AC4F4AFE61DB
blanched as her gown.
0x9AF30C02750269C90010311E84AB4138

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x3244951CF9434D728C4ADFBA1AA5CCE3
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0x328E68F257B71E55CEC0B853B4DCDD65
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x10C6F0AE5642B41DF2968027C3E710CA
at all.
0x9CA8A94963A52E4E3083D70C35ED0041

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x05FBB6E7E01EB20A9249170C6D21FE8F
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xE067E59CB5951D3E18FD5E0FCAA4653A
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xCDF706275E1C88C0A3AD8BCB3AE89984

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x9AEEAB48C231F195812B8FC5A8B97260
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x3AC912F712159117098B9C8929447F65
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xB478C380987C760DF5C376E9F2D137CE
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0x497472F2EC0E97C72FFF06967F746439
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x405652F68F80696706FF38EA9FC22782
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x17D1C386C355E6C2710F5A95901794E2
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xAB03BE984A833E70F744F6D69B4A9B6C
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x35178B645B7595B90398C2E8B2492B94
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0xC1D78C85E20BDD874414A1A33BC43576
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0xE7DEAB768D23912F6F1F61802FF74775
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x2677260618249CFBD3FD5D4505DD8503
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x123657EBC37009F8C56072B106F8A5DA
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x3D99E4033B60D62DB648F68C9A05104D
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x6669A471F99307B8943631598D495192
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0x15A5AD4229BBBF14AD2A0D02A835379F
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x25B43AC34B5EEB3B51F380A8756F31BE
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x44123132838AF6E3558E70F14C969342
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x18F3EE3329DA540DBE149299FFDF074C
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x2641859594677A4064C0D7E575D68D29
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0x4D2A1E1AA49FCB93DC5FA2AD98F56D6E
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x072E3AD3CF5AAEF0A930CBEA6EFB5470
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0xDB946E22B319210760280FB778D0053A
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x0ABA4FB6D771EB07546AB40DEA387945
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0xE023D9DFCBF08AFB122440ED66B935A7
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x30C9BEBC2AA297003578ADB18104042C
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0x843DF33A4DC561AC8289DA3581AD3C9B
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x876550E5906FC27371EA05C899DA0686
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0x40993C4D9BA8F6D5953535CC23BA6C97
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xA5BA7E99F763F1F12325BB234C961AF3
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x6736A274327192855706BF54B46422B4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x005014FBD829AB2A9A9FD8CC1F26E0A1
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0xDA27F3A861C4B9FBBEB9826E8EBB2D8B
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x33AB0168AC31C56A9D40A26192FDB834
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x971054B96CCDAF6E83EB1545ED6B1DFF
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x8680CE388CAF5A23A92C77D2BBBEF5A3
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x09E46E3DFA1F9FCD27E80173664F17E3
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xF29A32E243E22F154EAEC9627867FB18
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x12644A55302E120A09D48C545B0DFDDB
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0xA0708CD232D042B02D046B17B623B221
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x2FF006A9C2551B3403AF854F0D1B06D3
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x625E601BB6F920A4E23FC47220B655B2
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x7D38B295C8FCF1B085E0D5B82257483D
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x7364431891D1E22FF986B852AEB4AE5D
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0xDEA0E069289E5CA7D4823273EF29BF9A
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x358BD2EC965EA1BBEB2167718E17F16E
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x66B53D92558FCD2F6FBDFF12EA0A5FA8
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0x565EDEE6BD83413591C79452423703F4
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0x5EA465B04ABD3AC477293FFE0BB42E34
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x9E06CB48B921E0943B4B7C03FB197E9E
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xDB927E67C3CD10A9C18E922BB1C54BF7
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x5836749189C6D6229B7DAEFC9788234E
duties of the day.
0x8DDA459FD015CD337449BA16B2B21A6C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xD9C95AE6171EF661E040873D6E8C03DA
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x59141CB291F773ECFAEA086E791D3B91
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0xC28639F01F3C93A475239C70176D1823
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0xAE047CF446B819BB6C5F4875D14011D7
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x7666A28D6192C50B85CC59F2780C42CA
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xA8FF606C7266CF5B1367E496159D3D05
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x8348C67EC9F980AE3EEF30CDEFB3EA8A
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x311A8DAFDD79196FABC272C14AB80EC6
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x05FD10F782203CDEFD6F1090B80DF34C
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xE050546733A5CD65BB3B725918E3C791
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0xE594C3B4D04F3742859AEA297D8E8DB9
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0x1BE9FDDB478166196A7A0B67F205ECC0
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x2BCD2E78387E138305736EA36D5C3279
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0xE24AAF13ED88F0837C0A1EEB580E6D56
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x4B1FB314F7CD6B30700D1C749DC88CD5
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x8A47BB00E6BF9A96E6D1DE2901B19E24

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0xE1FB9818D169D08BACADC31E61502654
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0xA35DF323D14D92F2BE8F2F8CADCCABBE
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0x08B7FDE822D0EED2BF95F26441F54F62
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x91E40FF683B5BBB3D74F0697C31CD1F5
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x3656EA9C0DC5EED4C936E1263DD0522C
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0xD9F99AEF460DAFD1D7EE5D1D09D1DE93
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0xF5C78BC85C8AC59572592F42435A1118
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xB25FC65022D32A7C13A9224D85E5D8D2
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x6D0F66C3DED672536B9D3263F16F97AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x5568A9379A6A1FB50FF9F55476D461EF
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0x0C4B259584F6D10623B6A2F3CD8CC696
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x5EF709CDD1321501640E1A58DB7DC1C3
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0x8638A0E2B53190E1D2435436FDD728A9
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x0BF9A8B158AA2B1EB2EBED2A33DA8A00
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0x175DA9A6713D912D67D9CEDA381A3D11
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x4F420F2830DFFAA9DFAE11E69A7FBC12
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0xB24AA6AF62D799DBD16D14B957D8DC05
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x0EFA2169AB0F89CE0A29A6764487B7F1
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0xF270E6662B7102FAE1A11FFC332D672F
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x791843C241ED73D2F353CCE18EEB3E4B
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xAB2C3FC1066ACAD2668B23D8C9030C3E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x4A9CDB8F8FD15DB8941E36C598878DB0
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x1D97B9D2E45C7CC2673026A13B3A1BD7
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0x09BCC6A8A565B1B8D82EAE77886E59C1
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xF06110E7AE2163A6C272178659B448AC
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x8CD2A7FDE463F8E6FFF4B98D70D9BE47
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0xAAED2AF39D524EB82D1B07521C9E4306
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0x0E6A66B3A801D2A073954ECBF0FFF0DD
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x92F96826998A2B1A07EA97E6143CD63D
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0xB8B37267608D49EC87BC353B83C92DAE
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x6E53343C15F6AE2F896E532E5E148A1B
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x73A2644FD586C6FAAD4E0BC61B35D213
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0x269B05C8385AC3E4AB0D08020D4D3E62
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x6981013AAD54F17B7C6B5FC29683D8B1
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x8BE4AC9523FDFD027E2B5DA6CF7DD08A
acquaintance.
0x966D3C2821EEA3A2844CBBB0A9A162FA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0xEB5E5B455A7B4E3443E66AFAA5279005
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x5A8BD1DA97562144B3A8529797FD4C96
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0xE9AF8BD84CA7631E2E6F433968EA7017
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x0428FF8BBBE820195050D382B0C143B5
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0xFDC3ED79C351C5D0EAF111C07EDD9340
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0x6A08CFE052E216F25FF573748210E459

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x209A5E1CD0CCA0C0B7485C2B6F744C3F
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x63C2CA93FEFB05E458F3CBE280ADDE50
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x98E61A9FAC225B5145856B497A5FB6B2
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x529191C02927B038583156EFA0F84571
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x376AB1BB142EC501755AC19D199FCE83
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0xE453E716074BF3C3A844FAA09D8D3F69
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0xB6BFBEFF4CFCCDF1140AEDCDAF7EEC33
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x53DA35182E5DA552100B056EAE20CF90

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0xA45BC1149E527689BBD9165323D0A486
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x3B5FD024CEF1C7CB5BFC5774CCC1D4BF
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x793E829ED9F0FF40D746D669944A7AB8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x1E2A6D77B39A3D0925C80EB4EED4A95D
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xBB9C9FEC49BA5048DFD5317782E252C8
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x9C39F913277672570CB1C38CAEBA041A
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0xE230FA382BBE0DBFDBFA4E1A1CF295EB
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0xC53AE065E58461FFF6BE1AA7E4963462
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xC6FA2CEDE3353DAB67B1CFE26B6EFE5A
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0xA3A43A076EBCEB3DF403F50351DFC9A2
day.
0x53C7749BBF691AE7B72B9CCEAFB5CCBA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0x061BB661208C4CD0DD8C3829AF20E9B5
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xEEAD26D456080DB89BB7999B9B5F69DC
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x707E5E8111396C0C0F067E2443D637DF
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0xE5DD5C31F3066AE6B0F2BE752EF74EA2
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0x44018311905EF28F435AFD1E13328BD5
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x894C128BC4F30D630BF24A8B81D6400D
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0x6E35D7FB3D07C02ED2243758FAF2CD1C
Hall.
0xA28EFDB42EC46FCD863ABDB268327E22

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xF6654B796B8E5CD6CCB8417F14FB3555
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x64161525E577BFADCB37951476F51326
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0xE95AF545856E33944547F0830F45A8A0
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x46AC9B28F1075553B834286DA3C908CE
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0x74D95E85E7F7E4D5A25A69E8B82162A1
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x4CA3D7FF0457BF212460AE3C4374F413
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x3DE7B19FEE90049D3AECF04251DB50FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xB6840685D3D98E1D550F7348EDD1C47D
high family, papa."
0x5AA70123F06F84F36541A84DAC5C2C24

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0xB9A09D7BEE1168B8A86AC414240DD69A
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0x86FF5B4BB4EA484464A13C559054E047
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0xC538169005996E6859DF3E29E95677B6
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0x2CE593307672C45220D5088C5EEF6E27
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0x732F9C4ABE67928E625A7CABBA8A0945
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x2AD2A8F18EE5876977F6045AB79BDB9E
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xF4095D3BF58B63392C1EE87C93460414
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x84AAC2B731011300051731F6779E7C3E
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x8AA497F5088B12AFEE5E3F9B3D6F2301
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0xDDD8E755781A504B84C5CE367EB6763E
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0xEF51A82F0055297D5C5E324F592A090F
compensation for the want of fortune.
0x096541B600FD5C2168A6DFEBD2982C3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0x70A6AE10DAFA6F2C890A731165420100
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x8F81F51281EA2B1C9A2C9873AEDE913B
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x29175182836627C37E9E02B6D79D0B65
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0xC1B65267D2E6C41870E73081F01984EC
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0xB58A04E3FC5121612FD57C3BB60F7C45

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0xD1A5A314AFA6CCFC209500F0723526F4
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0x0A3812EB57E19CC1ECE06E336A99CD12
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x222DEFBBF50DF367688905A3C956629D
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0xD6C5C4D429B7CBFCD503F2D25DBD6A4B
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0xA1B8B8EF61F76D6A178A7967A54E440E
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x2BC840199B76D74484E76C18BAD2CBD6
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xA16DC0B28C0B5BB39E2EF10D341AE304
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x074734D7E1C6273B3187A0747DE6EE81
Rivers.
0xA49463C975A34F00867E7E29D207C944

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x573EF6EF9872D2E92F780B5CDDA3A147
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x3D3B4A0521C0AE846F5B3C02658E14C2
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xC65AB5C747E88DB7FE73D0A6E4297EF2
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0xE63F77963176F7532F4CB32B307C9F0D
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x9AAF3A1EC4FAC7FEE2A93F265315F207
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x9A62E862D7C5C7776E4676F8BFA05B15
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x7333676C077C4C62E15069C3C574C897
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0xEDAF6BA8352B63F4ED6462CA672F57AF
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0x924437EE75482132B62BBD17156DA8BB
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x4AC7B070921D3B0666C55F15F639A6B7
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x7C680E856EF5528511CA21AE8A578DB0
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x37FFDDABE819E38C7814F7DA9A43C715
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0xB48643B0A7EB5CDE67E76B934F83A1D2
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xD2B7ADB737788DFBF460772C8F6A742E
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xD03433C87EE845A0CB24410A89BE0A60
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x93015107A481BAC5BDA5AC44111592F4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0xDDF7D2A8072215156B7DDBDB0E76F13C
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x0D178E181D91394C4030AAC6EB069BF1
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0xCD47786D5856BB9E5F1ED1934375D894
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x5CE362A76D1F7258D1B181D91660F7F8
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x611721E0B0BDAA81F993BBC3456F5B8A
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0x9245F09EDA84A45F67D8B64A6DEBEC72
him some good, if I could.
0xC2ACFC628426681CA908934BABDE1DFF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xFEDBCA6037123CBA90E6DBF7D49B88D2
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x1363841A2F994C9D3B79EA40900144D5
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x539F21C93E53C535A497CEE470230764
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0xB4E55167D5E860E6D34F62760B812AF5
him talk."
0x5DD73C39EE8BBF07B282B1010961BD97

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x05495421F81F76BC689A782431C09B65
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0xD233D6B6D578F436D37A2A22280AB6F1
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x251EDD115985CE82F84C538CD87EE47B
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0xBC20CC2BBC33D5CDE0A3A56C0B1F7F92
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0xE34EAC68EE41A35413EDC4F38324F282
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x04187F2679E4DD1852DE29845474A88D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x60DFE5D1A0786C36E6F41F1E470A65DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0x9B4330F4CEE2735EC54E8544C9EC7824

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x7BA70A4B1B25923CE3833E62EDF6C496

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0xF6C004196F3C163F83F4CA1803C17CF8
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xD9E107C73DA53E8475847DEEEDBABD84
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xE124D2CE23C30119CA295E405051BA1E
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x6E9944FDDA4EC1B049BAC49B06C542F1
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0x57DA5C6CBBF3A75E41C9701A93ADD581
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xBE5189694624AAA15A071A5310C0BA2F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x1AF6B0896E319C9023A902F3635C53DC
graceful and correct drawing."
0xA461BF763519DAB8C1FAF9DE803F5FCA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x11F6A0D1A60D6AC65ACDBBA1F30F3D91
like?"
0x81493AD266C7C69FA4AB63CC5B3D6D5A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0x6DB035805C435C4E0D3E3FF6A61D5BD8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0xD0091A8CCD80CBE6958E8ED7BB6919BF
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x90E43B365684DA95A3D8AD478F47F2A3
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0xE54CEC4AF0C72BFA0E3D4098F189644F
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x9761AF7468F0709B5432509A730AD8AD
deem worthless."
0x021B57CEB9BA88BCA2AE0FB03B1507B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xFCEFA027788E0EFC5D367E569F37E9EC
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0xA2E2392AAF0AFE7FB11DFE34CD0FBDB4
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x04B51905ED14B7AE1490423B0EE1AE76
smiles!"
0x78761FE6119C6EF1D6031A4385CDFA0D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x93167C4BA7AE3ED8024C114804E7C25D
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0xB355B787B3B46A1BF9272BA5BF27DA90
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x42F76356A6E84B8250CC8B856E6C4226
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0xE0699FE5ACF0DF3480BBF383CEC28821

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xA42413B5EEFC76FD3093A0A637981290
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x0A1FCB6399BC697FC9B48D660C8A4BCF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xBE9F7F1C9724B056B2D6B0DDE5E932E3
or wise is another question."
0x5A759832359975E2908397FF6117A082

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x3792DF48267CC92A2D44BD9738222723
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xB75B2384FC06D5D2A8C402B79EC7F4CE
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0x8D9C94B2CD48E40AD35F3D1ED40D386F
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x532D63CF3876CC6005057874098226E6
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0x397E35CC6E773D04363601B885224F8D
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0xFC2A4DBF7E60B2C7058FD53E0087CAA4
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x78373D96C672BD429EB657B44F1EF985

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x00C3F72E07C8D5C53DB516A63D4E63C2
take to yourself the original at once."
0x4FD5B2040DE5DEFAF837C26FA3F23147

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x260186802E9973972DD1E38E407626C5
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x8B1C9CC6F53EFC168CF5DCADCC66B710
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x7965FA7C94469CB5899CE2431574B25B
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x59DA8AEB61DB98BC7BCC3FA35960D059
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0xBD2C93FEBADD7774DD3EB6705B7FFF12
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0x3E8BE755633F07251C0A708B9DAF980B
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x56F038F35ABBCDB1DA71022FA0EAC524
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0xD3C802C879BBA7A950586CC494DA5153
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x42BF6A1F30249754B1E18EDF0DC8A534
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x9F48754CC61A9BE5508F9FDA8DE642BB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0xF184EEE5E530E3DCEF8967C2233DB12F
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0x079D5725A04D15313F516BE61B67D0DE
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x996BDE3BC72BB029FEC4D5F937A2CEDF
ought to marry her."
0x8DF56BA5459A3BD9742DA72E884A55EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x3DB03C80DE2FED5ED4929A160173552F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x027A806F167447AC98FF2BD6E4939D30
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0xDD11A3CB5221A4A1D6ADA0F1B1E01079
often."
0x2F60BE9CEBDFEAFB88340F80A6F05467

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x2E542DD07583ABCA7EC0EAABC3DD4FFA
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xD854241F417FDE1912EFD0A585BFA5F2
the table to measure the time.
0xA99DC1FCBE2B0EF28FD7E97C272A0FB6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0xF7C51646FCA391CE1D5A5C0B7A6FED89
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0xF14F305CEE9132E4CDC733A58D449CA3
fetter your heart?"
0x30A3C6CA4222D8E6775A9AB4EEB0B2F7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x662F5909F157249A6CC51EBE6DAC7807
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0xCF40E3F2BC242A5B3F95B0D2389AEDEA
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x13307FCB616D0912AF09C197AFE1786E
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0x68BB667486EC090C983B3BFFC801725A
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x1F961A51C93D55E15860DB755AC5B5DF
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x9D7328FB4625D41BFD57A5EB5A462416
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x96CDEC159CCAEB745DB7A6939EC77A0A
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0xAA09467DAFE134F9071F9248605584BB
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x6184F01352114BED7EA8312E8F356ECE
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x463CFBA0BD4A1B849EA571EF1284201B
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xBB52B6E1AAD19A8D055883E047466A63
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0xA3114817303913CC99F089C3E002927B
time I marked pass in peace."
0x444B175E4BAD9A7E118B230E2B4DFE70

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x98C468FE85478A1DB78B9595EBAB8DDC
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0x3A30D6CEB7DD20036774783567561CF0
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0xC459592E4FA32AD37CBF49AAFCBEC49B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xC336AC3EB853CCC12E0771D4DB7E790E
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0xFFD4F44B3D9DCBB5680B44E90FD1F857
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0x770DABE09BD2C8DF1F463AA4D6C2FE91
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0xA4B4EE2BBA23C8269FEF3A9FB24E6219
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0xF6135F52B46BC57633801BB111577C28

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x326EC96262DE944ECAB4C500F3D3EED4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0xFD75516A6CB7114929D2C736E4A64FF2
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x39DF0C2BE5EC5EB7E53831D2087160AD
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x4C002056D757AAF3F81D551D8D73CE4F
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x965150E85701C2CA9CB1C1878F57C3D9
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x570F920A6E911803B13120DF57D9586E
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x7ACC25AA22E9FF0DBCBCA7194CEC0A35
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x29D832958E4B7B415245E358E18CD866

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0xF7F3CAFA0D43AE91378168556CBC3C3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x57909EB1CE742AE41DBFA56286F85C4B
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x51368A8FCC668D15536DEC5DC9EC8414
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0x749C33A1DE43B12B065C9AFE92BC4981
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x92016929BDA0645C9A217543F35EC3AA
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x67D361A64D58F2BBB3B71521501820A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0x6B19BA79AF787941405DF49E48B8EFED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0xAAACD0503D167DE43350A7BCE7766442
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x3EFC375723698017AD8AF21B092F0E3C
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0xCA2B4E3D4C89C0962AE05E80064D72BC
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xCFD5156B85AF88BA5368C3F44BE1FF2F
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x8CC53F1F1D1C432C8D23FC390721A741
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x20A5019EFD106F32141E39C859EE3DFF
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xD5200D3B97FAB0F540E169E429F0FD87
live for."
0xEC958222B829DEB03AD4A4B14FB7E8CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x7CD13032C8237D0571D62A670FDE1C41
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x2044DA74C3CF554A1123BF48C3D748DE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0xE48AB57679159E19C1C56A25185D6BF8
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x67E20BEBCB8C20B0871610748724CCDB
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0xE0EBEDB408DCDBE47B39024CEF5CA7FD
should do."
0x464B2DE4989FCC15E53E769F1804A706

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xB42773206BB66D132E2F5FD435237048
wasting away."
0x7B07F89483BDE8959E244A81A093786A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x50F2B14FBF77B3AE342677E6BE4DFB3D
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x73EAD89A1D1B15AFA6F62F990601351C
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x0E51BCA3911E829F644A10CE604449A0
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0x766E4354136BFABB06076AF5ED21CE6C
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x90BD376CED14A7823245547CEE98F841

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x72D91EC1923EC081D7C6356C96F4773E
schoolroom."
0xEBE7FE2DC5C966F5F39A4AAA1921BFD6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x6D47A5F95789EBC45F44D7CFED179DA4
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x0D3AB2FBEB75660A6873807A633F7E93
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0x9ED2F16B8CF30E005232C3AF54E0CB6C
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0x79318700A058767D23EC0EA333CF6CBC
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x8C63A368C1A649D2966F55E688FC8B7C
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x1DF980521A2A29CC688E86BBA721F99D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x67D7C60215CB21FD964F59F725B17DEA
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xB1AD2A672B7ADCFC7166663BF4E480D9
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xEE5D1DE2D267776B71656F0E4AC7BD2E
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0xEE7AD3FC25FC0DF5AD15B228EB937111
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0xE58A72C7451E24D6D2422AAEACFA8900
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0xCB7ADA67FC40C04D21FF93B52657D2BF
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x441C907DF3D7C16489446D3DD77B709B
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0xD03ACD6A4036666D6D05B67DCD370E07
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0x24F346363C622B0EF5828AABE84B7CB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I smiled incredulously.
0x9F954C69AAC4C800BA43DCBDB3B117A6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x5245622A69041CAC354E9C14B6D967CF
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x73119DFC2004A76D10D010FFEDE93228
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x26C19BBC5AEB97976DC009C80A70A648
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x56E6709B6626462563D997457330AF01
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0xF6AEB75855B2EC6D4C3000B95FF13279
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0x0154693E234672B81B6956BA6C514AC9
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x47179F16946CA5FBC4AB480B991179AF
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xC60A07A97BFA0AF8E4B50526CC9EB528
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0xC220AE386853AFAEF92167C6121BF568
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0xF27A14356BC8FE7E4E35D82B8170F43C
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x5BEFD1F3C3C93EFEFB8E3ADFFB52C2BD
still suffer."
0x8B28FB659F33BDF00969711F82CA3F6D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x71D14B6827407987D2D913E90584F01F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x4204502C8AEDF60EEF5C0D1132478DA8
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x68AF411F333E392B81495AF295288FFF
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xAD742B5FF0F3CA4A36D11402057B97AA
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x50B4EDFD4DAEF787354314E84B8577CA
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0xF5DB08B9F37895F17333784278B7525F
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x4AEFE2AF7A2BE758E9BCA0F6EAD6365F
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x9ECB96486DA8B4EAC0F4B41426CBE5DB
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0x0902B495694433D2D0FC57DB2CB4F26E
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x396CCD6C7DD26378E73191EE92B88836
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0xA306E91E04953DAAA1F5450F9DC9D548
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x8488F3D08AB435076D72C90FCFADD901
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x8B563AE1CFB778A5EFB86852357EDEDF
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0x2A33FD2446A8EA8C29E477CB3777DD85
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x442D9B99F2BC9F0F98F7303616BFB860

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x57A0D8E8C413C48A099480A74EE2D0EA
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x55F3DBAB8B21F46FBAA3E24FC68637AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x9B2BFB7BBFFCDA0B349B19A643C57B87
World, indeed!"
0x55B41671B05FB5A93DC09CABE8B71E50

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0xBDB3DB1F88BF45F6C8599250CEF44770

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0xA6C2B989A7AEB3A2BE18B904C6378170

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x995C8EE58B92067B70AA337CC5A881FF
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x440FFC8CF7B3C465077703DCFED8394E
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0xB3FAECE1A3C9CC9C8123B491D6610306
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0xFB167296CF8E74097019E8B99E818505
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0x3803A91669578D24C65D24A3B1F78123
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x66417EF8461912C3DA2F0B58AB9066D7
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0xB07D809DCEC20D3CCC627421EE14E254
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xA9F5752FB385544F427B9A516772527D
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x77EC9120215D3B97B2558B55EB5F7C39

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x12B2A3071FCF5AD5926E8588EA320834

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0xBA18E6B6674E75EC1621EF33FFFE02E7
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x106CF3CC5072A38EA896750FEACBA502
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x238C298FA67247E735E91B204A8CD6B2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xEE8665BC6244B75B3E039858278F212F
globe, however!"
0x22BBEE3DB17E0E19AFC1B93C84BF0FD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x27BC38649A64BFCDC08883DB7B7C0358
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0xD0007CE06D687CDA846DE6738D45AAFA
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x5F45CA9A4D2C5DADE73F89547C349094
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x3911C67B358320F5F482727FA297C100
forgot it.

CHAPTER XXXIII
0x6DF3569BAC429B93DAAC78892E902FB4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x707005B6A90B89ECAF682080A31B1842
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0x65587806A64A377F1EF6784D853441BF
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x21495A4060D37E5815FA330541877E22
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0xCF03BBA487383EDCF8B246B3DC8CF669
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x1299F9D15EE952A7593F26A2A6AD5077
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0x9CF12AF25E4E5EE2BBAA8958A18CB6E4
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0xB5AE4D2BA74F43604ADAFDB9B018709E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0xF66286343FC4F83F854E8CF0F00662C2
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0xCABBC038D1B2AE6D54F1ABB5B954929F
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0xD41F9129D69370AC9B0C9E8BDD76A02E
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xA5269CA06E00A630BBE9A492E5300379
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x82EBB06F6EC22A0227DFACB43DC222DF
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x73F119804B69F6CA09D7BF80E775DDFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I soon forgot storm in music.
0xC5016EEA9A4A095F0C18B562BF7C4B59

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x9581DE7D043DD7C410AAB8A78184F400
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0x786BFD4589F457B20D0D8AE8C1F00605
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xEB7A8B86B173AE3907A194D6824467BD
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0xDB9AE1A7D171647A9E2D8029DBC6157D
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x4CFEEFEFE1002D316B161D268DF5865F
vale that night.
0x311CFD7A1D3E586B02DABE0815456249

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x0AE6676B8A283C2E9A32566639E61E4E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x96853997E3FDDEBDC06F4C45ABD91D8D
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0x76DCFB24685FD8B5F3CAA170170A9C39
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0x5E5FBFB2E33B0399D78E603FF1DCFA6D
boots.
0x9C3E051E2ED1C3F3EC5BAFD715068A48

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0xF87BD051C7F16583BB644B536FEA02EF
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x2EFF566FFEDC9800736C82A3DED2C100
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x37CEBF9D6EDA4C45B474340D90DE12A0
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xB67A1D64F63C899C80AACF722C772A23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x633302A8C934A28711421C1845660F9E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x27D1C87B6FCAEDE80D10ED4DF02C6057
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x4A0B05F6A2AE5C24A1A8E76566ACCA36
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x9C058E9760B509A2177F121C8B89D46E
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0xE981B3DF1F5867A47C7D51CD4C5E96BA
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x1ABD59E4574874FA9A4089A6AB09BED0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0xA1FD5FA50C3888A4C11FEB9ABFE51CDF
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x9802FFF396066CD0B540556700228A2E
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x506707C7D8DBF484AFD5C47800D38997
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x21AFE02E1C8C2A3C1F9222836D84D197
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0x2D1759D90773724705575F600BBB39F9
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0xD4AD14C356C4AA42CEF99544EE66B133
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x1B3E379C0B61F9ADFEBFB8704C1D3213
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0x0F2B1952FD4F984616ED3209FFC1A1B5
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0xD9213D1713116F85ED4F997B18923590
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xD63DB925A46AD226D1F1533D9A5879BC
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x8984B4FEA4B76D3A81C50A82A301C597

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x49FB90018B79A161E23E5FDC7A255FE1
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0x05197AE27AA7A838C066477BAE154CBF
health."
0xFE155D2E72A461D971F9B34E6A3CE7EC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0x5052FEC4BFD01667FA0AA43D36BBFAA4
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x10B4D7D734971DF8149B646C19320B94

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0x8A340986AB4DE336AA14A2BE89EE9850
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x34D1C530685FEAF30F347D3B87260E00
silenced.
0xF9B8264271E00E1DEEF6313BD255BCB8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x8AF16A6539D8658835C4908CAA68EDD8
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x1D2C983B2ADAA93871A6E972F1DDE017
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0xF4DDA3B037449B4392077A8865F62CDB
was behind him.
0x58B30F8AC0251B84F32EE6958FFBB1B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0xA3EFCD51ED30D23A0CB8925E57C536C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0xBF9BDBA7139B974B64EF1C0D15DEAE90
alone now, and return to my book."
0x795C9E2A0908969B95D58170CFD41092

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x166CB194BF7E1C68A53F0CC6FBC64567
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x60230737323ED5E855E27D64CE9EC0DB
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x2E780DF2DA0B933F86F764D83C59F422
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x2C9C1BAF4DC8356430EE92479657D0B8
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0xFBA231744651F2E030EECABA61D95AFE
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0xDC121726F9D635F2B9D50B995DC96B8A
I would.
0x8D6C021E63A77FDB1882086DA97F748C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0x5475B19F10ED4FB56BC6B0157ECB891C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0x1079BFC7E96FB968EC1D082648AD13A4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xAEC84577079BF38D60F4C652B9DC6E6B
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0xEC6FF3C32F898775C9C93B7A922E9456

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0xDD276932CA59F9DECE191D6A6473D137
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0x141E369BEB6C3B47D013C976057985E6
and my scholars.
0x6B3AD2C2D993D4C3592C90D12F2E558B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0xB22A16A3836B7320AA8E315B4DF10E99
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x74CFE2E2769B9370978BF15DD37866FA
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x6A80A552F347CD055D5E0F66641EA8A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Indeed!"
0x9A5AA00135E57563648E617388C0A268

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x9C82DA7EA647373BA47281E287C7906F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Does he?"
0x37CC16984523A0F1AF0F75C04EDFB602

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0x5C85B2F8BD83650C301AFDCD0F017DE9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I know."
0x16B0E7C314B6ECED5B8B22F400681368

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Was it your suggestion?"
0x49AC35DFDE5D67F9EF67C12D81203AED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No."
0x21B484447AA3B863E0BC686A312D5D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whose, then?"
0x1463E99C2D8634DF40DCCFB0FFD90438

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"His daughter's, I think."
0x334DAA6EF28C2D39A7B7959AE52B4EA9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0xFA92C2F224C96EFC5ED81D7B1D418CDC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x8B47ABA737F6E59A7571352BA8A5111F
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0xB03481DF68CDCC752D4E9F5EB9F64A0A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0x1AE5CEDC1752117C0E4ABE45ACDC294E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0xB740BC243F264BFDB821BCEB8AB27845

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x6558024AD21A54E3BDDEE5A2DF32162D
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x78BE9E345B7D0D6C52FB58DFE06527EA
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0xE508051A0FCB8A4B8F6BA986C007E6E5
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x4D2523BE0CE3EE6A1527109144E6CA0E
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x07B19EF884B187E55DBB14012097332F
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x7D5FB3526EFC0BC3A1ABB754DDB3F222
trite or novel, it is short.
0x71506811EDF96A167706385C7E4BBFF7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0xF003D00E8BBA8A917DDE54DF15046947
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x11464FDD28C3D72FAD567814DD0B7598
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0xAD4D7325929BBC0CE0FA7AFB3A86BFE8
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x57C10896234B8958ECED52549AFB4698
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0x71245E43B4FBE2F7E005602F28FE9C0A
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xB3B3A497619443CD47FFA72C0A1D9154
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0xD5E86D1722C9883A713F19203FDA1D91
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xD75996A825FA4760E1ADDD7DA42E2A29
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xB2A2FA4C50E050F35E3EBB9F901A63B1
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x8E0AEAA092E2CF559D569DD80A252899
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xB53632E82FB8FCABA8F362ACB1F4BE58
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0xD38D6EE881AE0959455BE96736A9C015
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xEAEB23D7B65454E18C08EA3B84A758B1
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0x236AB1CF11BBFA93825CC5ACA7890205
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x597A8F02772C5763A6F268B44FBC4BF9
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or

not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x0C0F635D7A0903CAA7252A1A580D6E54
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x540E2070382AA9FCDEAECB8F244C5F2F
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x616C3B47DDBDFCEB80015ECE2FD7E87B
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x355BB4FDB68BD6F9EB72E84E46B620FE
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x9937653DD0622B2BAE4EDF06A8B9D322
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x69BD92FC66874CF014FD5530196A0DDE
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x90FB50FFB3AFE2E18A3F897E900E6C7E
Rochester."
0xBDF5393781639B0804DB528F855C0228

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0x0B46C1B5F085D22DE1BBFA24AE874225

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0x63115F56477CBCD8A14EDDEF92843FFE
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x43C77AD1A25A33FA659D98DECF0F5C32
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0x36E56E2F12077229159F31B43289952E
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x3E40EE3FE0549B0A49918330F8A4675F
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xE58502C3621F29E88233D55DABCD5A85
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x45EB8A6396A3AF70B5B44E273D932E7B
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0x0353AB21CC4A6ECD6D5F065A8E9A3CB8
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0xCC6523913595C540922BCDD8E8FFC53C
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0xCD1C61B91947FE3D004A473C00BED4BE
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0xB581E14B75F1B32727C0A63258A56572
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x10CE2259190EB7A97C70B45033549A98
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x92AE84FB4FD81A029BB788C79A590E3C
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0x66395EC69E517683945544943799C104
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0xB82B8509A1F770C62D71D44AF1AA279B
odd tale?"
0xAE3C1F406FDC27C2B5D458F0C48844CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x9FA5B3C80C226E36604F284359FAC490
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0x5D26F79FB9C6DAF26CB09BE341487CD6
doing?  Is he well?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions

him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0xC14B0A8B8919692F2587009E78FAF638
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0x48CE6D883C2B965B76BCA86F0FF457AA
which requires her appearance."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.

Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x2970374D2542AA1151E3C743E5C1FAEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0xB62DA88F5033CC1D8179DAE10F4716C6
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0xCD708A8FEA1DF6261F1671A00F6BED0D
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x9284CAD25F836057EA334D996745EA6E
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xE557520BC735A27A62937698F653BA1D
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0xB885245E8BEF05121587B1FC2C39531D
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xE3012834914183180DBF531C3DAA47EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x961DCC4AD9C911C47A73188ED20007C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x0D53712D29C3C9ABC2D5EE7AAC217BC0
warmth.
0x3D4399E7F9B41EEB24BCFBA07141783D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x3516E82138388DD58E393516406AFB7A
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x6978AE5A3A6B201D16C2A287187963A8
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x99E46FE27F46C28C38980F95BD6BC7EF
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x73FE0851D307A9FEB627EE4FC902CFC8
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0xC7537729015C2ED00CFFE0411F51F386

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0xA7A1568681C468CCB3EA3E51C134F53F
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xC3D0F8A2632BC730CEC0990722E851E5
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0xD7FD3E8841C82B49930E4752887F1A8F
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x8A1D70E0E742B9E01B8EA9D4172C0550
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x6589F6F849D19F6A7F53B527BF256CA5
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0x20000172A95FA0A16C24CD6C45DE2E84
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0x5974E7034819157D5486CCFBC75044F0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
0x32E1DC7477172EDC1BFD2C2C3D90A899
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0xC990CE4FA6D319FA5D4CE3AC13A9943E
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0xB387C04FC3700A2E12737A55215E2AFF
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x1512C27755E2521C2CD64B96251C62A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
0x7F8CBED41E006CBA2893FB47FB6AF037
Rochester than you do."
0x8F906F77858CFAA31F7217357D0C5CAA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0xF45C7F19E26C4A4E519CE04FF5477021
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0xD998291B1B9463FE049A8DBC0E926396
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0x47B620DB23B41703EDD5F16E9122806A
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0xB777F3E6B2446D1768FADC2C519759A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, what did he want?"
0x5D3074A32D91AC8FDA98B03805599C5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
0x237141F48581449155BD25E737916445
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x3634ED122593D99DABA9D1AAD46583AD
that--nothing more."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x728ECA377962C0EDB93179597A3B937D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Silence succeeded.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0xC00A27C5CF18D75F68046B50F1E84C83
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0xF850B158AB14D56670090458F299C65D
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x31E71FFD2570DA174F37228039B69462
will and the necessary documents."
0xCF0598989BD63F727B9943CAB4B6FF80

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x24A6F7E11788942114423DA9BED2413B
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xB98F621EFDCF991A3436163BC1428405
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x811077F6A58909F1133F9632F0A27165
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x3705B5D2336915873231411586C70664
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x223057A606E3A4FC231E44507EF07E1D
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x423792D32EE0AD4B61C95871E87323EB
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0xF4B1EC10F7B10BEF8A7FB60C68FF50ED
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xD02DF172C9029A616BB9202794CF2F18
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0xB880484CAF17FE888D98AC84D6DF862F
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0xD50581AB2BA550BC6B3244288A9177D6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x61CAE5DAA6A15EB66670D59FB761AF6E
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0x6C8E79A84E6947D9FB12458B66FB919B
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0xADC3723E98D1594234BE4848607B1201
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0xFBBF96A2B7B80596844FCBB4209B87EE
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xDE44A25CF7330E275F5C077D74D30679
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x7C6ECBE433F18BA5F1474D6AA149512A
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x846463ED19EA0A200985D4D5CA785C37

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0x39D55B0EFF664DA52F22EDEBA661A2F6
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x885CCA8D035150B5825A809AD05F578F
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x7BECCF1CE19AC2FE136C59FDAB83304E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How much am I worth?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x0200E5D172D6C174E43447DA93F348AD
think they say--but what is that?"
0x20B2D71EE188113ED7B5B3098ACA694C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x744AA041A8032216225E88462DE19660
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xDC65DA866EFB06C5D6F50A75EDF611AA
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x98C5492C28A22E0D07A0272DDA7D451D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x9001982798E1DB0FC9F45D293A5D73E6
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0xCE704B430D1207B0E4680D712B223CEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0x4F8D364BEAFA536CEEB0195CCBECFDF7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No mistake at all."
0x80B7FF2729B415CB36C79D9C113C7532

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x02536D995801FB36D90785D414974262

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x35B41B69D1E6FDC53E870DE89CC89CE0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x7BEFF0DEAAB07E893F8A6312400A64D1
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x13C20B4D2CF370C2AC22ED21AF3A5328
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0xF15A125D4A8C4B0F72099C8F80E850FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0xE2B93FD5F92A1122193CB38266093ADC
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0x7A2F5D1A420136656248FC86B1A79170
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x8B84429F415E58B84F8CB606ED8A61A8
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0xEBCE49BA89F76C79ADAD15C7D113EA89
Good-night."
0xC86016E7E592D9FC858896F06844B839

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x1AC98D4F82E5BE4F7F8BC12164C6F9A5
minute!" I cried.
0xCE1DDA45C1C2C5440D2B80C7DBB5B10D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0xF66135B8A177CCDBB79993D3AC62BB81
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x859A248B83785A418B6D03D2B6F2E741
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xB2A3DCC562DCCC3162B0560C193983FD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0x42F0F5ED6729DD7F946E5DF31DABECAB
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xFC63EE21EAF57BFACB788C9CA6E487CA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x527D05E26EEC0C08D615389F67E3F80E
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x3799D49A3384EACDA84BD19A3B016769
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x6B1E69BE3BCB0518D4342F42F18881DA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0xB8807FDCE39461355FED70CC78994515
about it."
0x7C04760D2C92DFBDF9526614DAE445FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0xAF9AF901D46320D5352C9A21BA110F80
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0xEE88769C05D8BDA49B5A247D8C0B0687
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.

0x5411C2B2769A9F207626D4CCEBA5DC23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed

all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my

0x3688E84B3B1E74A8D3288F18259C2B02
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x3BEFDBD94B0975D9922FBDD8250ABAB6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x6DA077B1ADD7E1184F72EFEDF028A3AB
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0x51901BDDBB51E228131F668B91F18DD6
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0xD2373A52364354B0EA9EB5AB80B3CBB1
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0xCCE572F1137390F4A4FA69B14359FEA8
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x6D2A784EDA95C72F53D0098906CCB32F
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0x11797B9C518258CDD0615E57E414D1A0
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0xCEBDA8257E960B10178FE4FA2840BE09
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0xEA28517BAE3E2A599EDBD2EEA7F2D695
explanation.
0xDC1E80999E32F1E8A17696774B629A6A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x448095F9323B2D8A1C877AACECA2C7BA
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x39A6C04D741B735B87DA8B1227EF8DC4
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0xC74CD8D0A3877FD6E9D2C18DA0A14D99
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x33BB1A8BBF9E8BEAE8F408114DA01D92
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x8F792D4084C4779C9A1421927D30979C
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0xD14C9F54E16388DA7693A25E48B7B97F
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x3CAC322C0DE52ADEB09B1596D2D9942B
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x921CB2C30412570C95D201ED599035F2
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x2F17DB944B9B2A893C84372CB8BA0145
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0xBDDA747F97710E0ECF7CC97A23898B69
against the door.
0x0D438E6F257BD1118EB069E143834CB3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xC3F79293A02CCE82497F4B289D1FE433
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0xFA738F0FCB1C07B0B2F71788F8B97AFF
enough.  I resumed--
0x23376CEC0E58E073470CB4787B553FFF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x627E801A68F18FBB53F4180F39056800

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."
0x53FC696C6BE96DDD8ED6B947B0B87C7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x076BB45FEB9F892C628FBD419D976038

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He bowed.
0x5FA2FDE6B1C4B503FF49A687444F0A10

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0xD58E197ED091064B7B866330B3B0EF18
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x134DB847053E232515BBF3CC8E4A44DB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Undeniably."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0x127B8DB1A5D9CE2C08D46D71AF67CFAC
the same source?"
0x8EA0EC5FCDFD51DB6EA88034F10D6D92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We are cousins; yes."
0xD3F26A7E507083AFC61D8F4F665CF668

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xC555E4E62AE0B989E5B55532E8128BA0
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0x3BBD3BA80DEF291E3170D7975F247CF8
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x52271F1E35E67AEB3D6E9BDE9C11BE75
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xCD70829E311545D1FE42C16D8DC70252
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0xFAC03FBF43EF275083B49344FC5BCBFE
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x9E63C3D222F22D4A7E4269DF2C4A502A
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xF67BE9F7E70F168C8356009E3E7C1C06
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0xA0088C5D2E8BE4CCF0F4A96B314C47C2
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xFED7786790D1D28E8814AE0A63EE732E
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x94ECDB77D837A4BFC13CCF561765049C
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x5F0855168975EF5CF0D1DA7FDC30BDDF
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0xA26405F11810D6D626B1757BF9355FA8
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xFE87E87830587C6961A9091F64041505

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x68C05BC30373A2D7C161F8A1E61BE28D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x569459FD2D98D833DD72FE80C0F7AB39
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x5FE7CA0CDF0221712985EF0D0B3A2318
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x751D39969F92412857806EF4739DE58F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x208EFD0957316C58CDE8FF4E16D25059
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xAB395208DE3C756C556C1E43CDE1AFF1
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0xE86AA58EAAFD926F25975CB29D811483
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0xDDA74A688B5884DD3825FB7A2974A6A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0xA84C7EE19E3B53F16696C94A39E9F4A6
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0xC18950EAA6F7D6AACBD03233DC0911E1
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x3385E0CAE30B5AEED61ED1761D276513
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x4ECFA34E086B98078B153329E4147798
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x2E2757213DDE2DF1CCD69B985C16042A
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0xB2988114E09D2C05049784A67273E1E3
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x39076D503A81D8E10900ED297999CF9E
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0x9D6C7EB8C0847BD469109258B7466343
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0x800E36295EA2708953B063CD569BDBD9
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xC874A16D7412CBDED36BCD699DD94D7C
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0xD1EE93086AB0C5B0240A610FF0C4D5AA
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x697894BAB1F61932E765B095BD1338E0
enjoyment.
0x7C66680CC1F02596BB14BC9A282290E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x434648F851686CCD9ADDD940D483741D
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x8513BD77DA60D8BF2C677C8ACDD616F1
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x97121D1CCAA4000B1964B72760D52CF1
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0xFD8A41CD2ECDFF9D6865D2F04B2E45EE
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0xF89E8CF4B356699C3D2727D90829BF4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0xE10D658784FDED21F6086DA364E4606E
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x86CAFD77549E2BF1DDBD1B00F6687B0E
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
0xC303D1AC07D9288CDB9555EF8EB509E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
0x1955E05D1AC484D0413FB122084434ED
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
0x04124ED3F5171299A79C92B648AD305C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x6A5BAC1C4A24C8EC51AFDD64880AAC2A
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0x3121287AE58B8364FBBE58995D2FA2F8
like an ordinary mortal?"
0x89FB4F2CFBA7661DE6C1C4BA61E3321A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
0xAA86274422924A06B0C490399F75F6DE
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0x373C38868000E8485D17DBB845C66A06
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
0xF73E57353C113E9FCC66736510550CA0
comprehend better."
0x8058A973B53451F8011DE8604BAF0C98

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty

thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x617A09EC428D937B9F2BD13B02EE0D66
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0x9C10604EE473BA124975324E42A20916
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
0x835BCE9FFF1C1C8C2B4F01D4AB348E3B
fortune that has accrued to them."

other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x310EC7778966DD7CFC9BD426EF00A40C

like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x554EAA8FEE31025DAD6CE7195F3869F7
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x31116DEDA4BD5FF8911D00DF54D91A3C
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0xD5ADACED12E5B9CD0AC4D0FA5391B258
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,

though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely

the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0x994FBB2F9A029937888E2983FDA2C922
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x8C0AA35853626A23B41AB3A8AD621529
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
0x6C4BA4ABD6ABE1C64FEE413989D08CC8
consider it absolutely your own."
0x15E02CDEAF048F758F039F1506F1DF62

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
0x2DAC5035E5B1BCBB4ED6D1E84E00ABFB
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0xD3610A95139FCF39E14968FF9EC0A923
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
0xE06FB8BD82A385E90AA31F1184D214A9
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
0x8C14FF49EBDA1B3805FA3BC79F1A08F3
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
0xDF313AFA1250495CA7B31CB850F2A563
myself lifelong friends."
0x96EA9B4EA16F1361D95F03A1BC25A53F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
0xEEAB7CAD3292B90BEC436C4DAE3966B9
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
0xC35D89FF4D0B87416FDBBD4F69D71769
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
0x6CC8C5089EFDB42063F7DAB059FF4B3F
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
0x005148DF08D7035CAFAEFED940AB602F
you: you cannot--"
0x58CFEEDF740E301382E429F050A75DDA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
0xAE21A2D839DDD9A873058C82575C9C8B
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
0xFF45DECBE2887FF83702C9002AC57827
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
0xE9CB7C6AF6CB5B0D3A5435BEF66C467E
and own me, are you?"
0xE0355AD9FF29B8509F2CD8D27533A4DC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
0x3FCEE8A3812368CD0DC92C54BC506187
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
0xC44762B56078E200BEC11152A930B291

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
0xE6059FAAEAF8D1C478F5AA111D26306B
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
0xAF468E156D60B70BCF588B18E67DBE4F
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
0x13C3F3EFD8DB934794BE588593215EC4
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
0x8934E3FF7C62B20B4039BE4E352F1251

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
0xFB0E5C55AA2A05DD5C7CC28A77ED54D5
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
0x1C858D0CD07ABDC1CDDBB26BD275D190

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
0x4B950F5F025E630AE0B896BE3599F2B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
0x99D7C104006FEC027EF7400C6B0D8A2B
excitement under which you labour."
0xF13EAD865C8A6CF9630367F5ACA88BA0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
0x7C50A99BE751CE1D9130B9C5D7D7B4E5
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0xDC0DD3354E4D7317D3E4146A586E0334
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0xA3D30CF18716F125D54333F3C1D26257
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x53D17B72A94B1C58DC6EB5795573BE4C
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
0x30D1CB2D1D50DE15792C09CF106A96B3
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
0x1B0285C2E7EB1BF4CC8DD9DA6C001B30
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
0x0DC555A25D24F01C521F4CC17EBC554A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
0xE3B0C1057DEB6E80EFC12E9D12213CF1
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
0xB105A88831DB3EFE49FED65AA05530D8
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
0xA8E5020AA952D1980249F13ED4F3A892
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0x9C02EA7B0E5E2BA4E4A7594D10FA9C18
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xF1D33060957335AA047A4DC9CB9FD7E2
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x6D1A8E1B34B076B4ACC3A71F2B5541E0
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0xE7F7E22891FDF25085DBA611D5DBA874

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x47FC02F3E477A1D017296AAF447307C0
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0x6E8A539302F146376DABD8A22A5D6C65
scruple."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0xFA0DCC4905ABE35BD95AAEB6D6A75D54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0xD82DFE60F7316D74305A7C764DB266ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0xE561A039AFAEF986D90D653BFF502402
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x16F64B2DBC8A07D9D2FD4A6DFC58E48D
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0x3118291B1CB4796B02922EFFC9FF9510
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x371C0C7AC8E4247CCA11E31D44FCB54C
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x3E94C529EFD59ECCBA277B17EB47E99A
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xC243B8246E4916F91949090080A440DE
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x8A9CB3E39E01C3C2D31C4BDFECEC311F
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0xAEC659558F955FCEEBDF705784525C42
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x9829DA358763AAF7E38C8C350CFBF363
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0x5ECB29ED38BA6E52E98371C29B622021
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0xAF9904849D2611541D24D031E7CF9423

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x13A88C5F6DBE0D5F0F1867D52811F2F6
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xC0E4C988199BA7C824DE20E93B6B425C
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x777CAAE980032B87E4074F182E4292C8
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x08C556476E7C35A875C8B8A5BBD6B7DD
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xBF8FFA354ABE3120C73D4DECD30E1576
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x997B3EDD02FF5D3A4825D1DFD99070AE
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xEEE014661C2A63B96DE227C919DED43D
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x919D105F234C7CE90B481B9B64338A5E
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0xD10ABB8DCD4029772343DE06223789EE
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0x9131B8C420DDE930DD955A97D1211DCE
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0x5A8116426D10D5522328A64DA575E45A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x0346A4BA96F3CB7FEE83F07861BE3990
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x4D8C277B7DEF8765A95769A232C56A83
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0x96872E18C3B6B9B1CA5AB07E7977450A
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x8BCF867FFA467E61AC78B6C7861747D9
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xAF991836E6E5A5AA4BDDAD52C594C206
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x65DCCB854CDFC29E8C83F69C4C0D6A94
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0xCEE2E475451131A61F6E983A74DB5E4D
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x814204735FFF05FCB1866BEA98D9309B
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0xB36F34E8ECF9FD10B8D03515120FAEEF
girls.
0x9A12B38CAACAB86628FEF9A426EC986F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x89A30BB59DA0C3993CE5D3F6E0336EB5
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0xB321EAA5EE134159D6D7FF25B9587775
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0xAC9BF4FB3716D0DD4A80494DA4388C13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Doubtless."
0xB9002B1BFE4830B099179BE2E59C2942

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xBECB1FC6AB422F59FD3059BBB8A4BC57
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0x2A736A224639106592FD77FBD9985189

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0xA93B1EE978D208B6E08A4E71F06A05E6
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x9E3B851AD7A41A12392B408AD41D588D
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x1725C1A898C5984D8965CA487D1CC492
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x6CF4B641540174957A70B82BF75CB18F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x2D88D56D04A8F8050E461246D56BCBAE
What are you going to do?"
0x7F235C18288A96D86908123F079CC39D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0xCE8276C47100968FFCDDD9055406C155
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x1547B98CDB938058CBC39528A5F07CD8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do you want her?"
0x6C3C2CA14EBD467B0479ACB86ACF61A5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x99989C1CCD3C5F25095A93238D9436DB
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x264A45E78526C5B43C6B24387B7CC8E7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0xD7291827ABE710179C77D3D9F4D95B95
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0xA4DCB00C4512B780868BA341F25D663F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x151CDF3A935D95CB372A626C358E0DBC
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0xCBC8091778687701744129A32AD57DB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x4A7CDE74852A19D28364F2586CEEA733
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0xBD4043E97E2FC8B86F08BB478EC8CB90
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0xB9CC761DBC290E35CD462B229B797BA3
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x28B2AFBC2AB3968EBB44160AB96AC606
now?"
0x462532554416CF86E6E55B3D0763B31B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x187B611B8E1283A51C45B576DB4E5FB5
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x39BF8FC2F6A8651F0826535EF03369A6
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0xBF20949236CDFE30ABEE5318FE62640E
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0xC747F05D0073334294BBA82E5F6820F3
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x309C805B03C41A7AAA8A4604E82AB858
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0xFB1DC343D1C112C9E96FC448030B9E0E
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xB1D7B863438675C14780CBEC0577915A
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x5602DC0E56F512F683C4BFE0E7122770
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x0E58863BE0CE3E590DA7D352D9FC8AED
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0x4E996208456E3DD24B7C5385A2CADCFE
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x40651B8358DDE5701A10C6319621F5AB
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0xF0EEE13CB132EFED3DC710D19AB3AEC4
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x32D66B748DF2C621ED85E4F6613BCB38
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0x15D0E0CFAACB41AA5890737A376DF75A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xD0E5BEFD6642E70956EA57EA7BB3D26A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x8A30E6EC573341143EC31A9F6F452A43
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0x17F5B24E61C3CAEDD46DCC21BBA690A7
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x1A0F72078CE9A8D953F7D30E576BB16A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to

make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xC9BF2F5ECED55333424FBB15B39606B0
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0x7784BEB6FB66F0C2D8EA99C5AC425989
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x82E78FBAF366203A2DCA4167FA034A1F
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0xAD380D027F523159D8C854AD46FA987F
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your

energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0xFFC097B7DC4A1A67244E786E0BD0D0E5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x1820E26F6120078E88535CE9E300F377
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x5D2B9C6BFCEEEC9218E8C1C5C385DE63
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0xCA2A64A8263534558B6D175BA9C1E162

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x65C948763C343A1E40EECE762C434F1A
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0x452DCF3E0BC8D7501C0F85897257666C
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x385DF1D316B935DF382C5278D2434BE6
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0xC47AD5BA6D2E91B4F97DC1EAF5DA37DB
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xA39A0F3CD7492E610FA9260101529D86
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x6E865DBCD7B5EEC6EC1F0B7378CD41E8
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0xCB3F0D353183D4D3617FC980673FC1C0
hear, Jane?"
0xFECAFCF91DE2C401B4D34143B1B60636

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0x978A3B73AF1EFFC036F2F74BEDFA34A4
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x5D791104608B8B91DFF5A396B965BF94

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0xA7C291C74AD3A5356A4E0D9071933EDF
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0xE8B7EFA8DB16A618AF612CA531045E44
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0x9204B95CB502F169768324ADD836F05A
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0x8AA79746BA425BCBDA39224C2BE96A43
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0x23CBCA6B2492774E085DA777829426D4
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x88A578F831EC62481B127CAADC2E05A4
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0xDDDDD89B8B16574013570B7CDB004847
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x37382593AD4908ECE9CFCE00D6351A55
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0x65CFCB2DA4A315855E60E3A75C32AADF
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0xA5D8FC5ACF4B5FF0AC56B6441D3FBC5B
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x24BEDCD54B8F3FA9D7D423EBABA64492
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x04F3EE1ECA33E21C938BC1A5BBFF101E
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0xEB4214917B797AFD74376E048F2130E1
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x7537B8C768E2C06C20BA5C189A3815BE
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0xFF2FD71B0581C4C321F5F60B989E705E
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0xE25A848553D30BC694FC087A15308FB0
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x03F1D91D0B2429865B3EF05B421821DA
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xF5179486B618B3D11817A386EA9F2D46
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x48A14784DA7E790B8018B93C5E394246
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x6480830CEC68C2FD692A0BD1E585CD6F
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0xE369CEFA282659FC9E3060CFB5F174E3
without.
0x6ED72A37077C0979F2293AC65C662AA6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0xA866695DFAA11FB2B29B3A629B6316BF
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x24FD91010BEA5D91A0312687BFC0EB28
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xFAD5B8E920CC9E93055012C9917D5D1D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x642AC043EB8778C3EAC5BDA7FCC7CE56
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0xFCB3E8D2F2A20496EF10E648A892EC83
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0x9470D8EB2D74178C9B34D13E63B1A99F
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x835A8F92452227C5536DDFDEB8D90D23
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x691C414A90EC83F95B6CE8EE19C6261D
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xFD407755B5D4C80186D381E61E95CF9F
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0xFF9C337B0AB61C50D78E4C723561CD43
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x906D4E63053B2AB0345A5B43C9C24504
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x3B3B8B95487FBC014E39A014D086DD17
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0xFD490458EC627C225D4E273E7F8B9DBD
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x826B14E6D3C51B74F507374B648EA5A5
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x46953082E5A0F62602E38D179EF344DF
improved aspect of his abode.
0x5988F492BED38F7B1D54E9B0777F98D7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0xEB8C108F4F169B499ED2AD6C79F9A58C
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xF9D78D9AC750CDC01DC10DC9F3BAB1E8
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x9BDBCC69C8B236180FBFC8C585D43807

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x87F9691E1D5CCE4EF80F55EF89CE1297
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xCADF8416D2B402FF90EB19CA7472062B
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x50802916625CE16BFCC61D63382363B5
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0x4B05DB6F8CE68CD6605847CF1A1C02BE
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xCDBF45D2D43CE92197057FEBF7E40CB5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x85FCD2F84B73B43F425F27725D877E78
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0x1A1DCC5DDE959BF7751D2F7A35ECD5E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0x4EDB4C115D74B3B54C090B2090F3A7CF
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x702A517702D770697DEC5CFBD694E2E6
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x81E8BDE8CF45F2256729908188118AEB
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x505B675FD626C19D1BAF27403B9971D3
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x4595CAB77479ABF01AB4800B90BAA201
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x9E374E776A071C6935BF97B38C235743
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0xDCDBE9204B0B47F7F05F7E4704EF70D0
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xB95D9FCBE04C16937BFEE83779C21D0C
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x88E192CC4D9E2A23D81A455AAEB42CCD
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0xC2B4486437F7ECAFD048FA8D453C12CC
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0x5FDB91D65B5E5BFF81349014A04C6A4A
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x8745C2BAE2B2632C0F126391C6CF469A
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0xBB118E452D156332DB064D2C450D4AD2
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x07C87995BA7505F94863FD6137C7E21A
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xA72B21FAD36CB233A1AFA36CABB07E97
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x23DD95798B1D1F6F066793DD1816CED5
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0xF7A2E5A54CA19FC7239E15FE9D82B2D8
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x2801AD2CE069F9901CE21279D021481F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0xF4FB9112FB38D2D4D59850E5559AF411
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x0DF5B936206C6F3420E5B1B5A2308AA2
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x0FB806885F6F5A446BF9D89942FB74D4
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0xDAEFC141A03A354F956D689BF630A2E2
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x687CC1925F814188905E057244DE8D6C
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0xE0FBCA0B0F44B9F7B4E39D73AB2D1689
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0xDB9D5ED8DEFD0499FD0CAC57AC55FE18
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x5FC7EEDBC6AD017A872BEED94632C1F7
career--I see it now."
0x823045B0CE192FCFF143E892FD8FEE1E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x64B64BED01E264A5F4E0C307919909F7
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x8969CE57FEA89C15FC115F47653E90CC
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x1AE3DBD51EC9CB1326357C530B636CB7
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0xC04ACA1E106010F0CE1EB24EA46A5E96
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x33D8DA2BFA10039176EE65AF81A5804A
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0x7C1725DBB4CEF2C46E1D488B0699A068
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x0EEAC6B23C4684861C2FC595EC6F05C9
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x23B938CEEA36CA995E7358F025AA5071
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0xEB909E55121955CB8C5780AD5C92AEC4
into the house.
0x3E40B63FD953F8D237E96087F06880CD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0xD86D50B696ECA9214EB34505B2609E03
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x209A7C44ADEAFD2EBCEFF798536C4AC4
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x19252BAC13019DF950CC19B7B326BCF0
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x7730F73EE5F5EB31B09EA928DB839248
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0xFE87DC12375F4CA0A4E1A4970012380D
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xB68DB6DA09D8F3DFE87BCDEEE3D5D56A
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xF9AADA4954E59FD41C08D19B9D702369
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x5B2A92AF1CD89645B2B727553C8559F6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0x91BD1960A92F7480B98D0BEFB07CA42D
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0xE62200C83053FAC2DC29923DA0F39987
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0x81DFB230351668A025A28BD3BB92EAE5
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x2981120C1C893650D814B203023E77E8
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x9631421F9787798CB7EAAA28857E88EE
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0xD802F043C8A126B67532945899AE841E
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0xA7D59DB392EA6D878FDE2290EC5616C9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xEB29F52B02D22D01559BAAA84AF1C59D
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x21EA2EABEBC7D8444779DB88DDD1E721
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x2F08349FE61011B994C95DEB853B52E5
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x7335233990302D4C11919DB1C08DD4CE
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0xDE50A35B2BCD67159A6F797C108C5EFD
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x8507B82BB17A6343824D4C1760F53F94
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x9CE77DE529A558FE126CEA4C3E602364
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x164F579D4C82D12F72393D3021700F4A
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0x492DEB00A9BD4832A17DB4897BFD8EFF
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x1F46E1CC6391D4B65AF3A41E89A48A14
mother, who was drawing away."
0x310E0F7C2A1A686559CD56F35A42EDDF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0x001FF53C27AB27F8D660D1B86DBF029C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0xAD6AFDEAE5FF5340175053D946FF11B8
the way."
0x0521F174A587B259794D9D8DDB14776D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Tell him I will go."
0x8A9F870FD209B93EF3FAD6ADC5E355C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x02468A4363CF03E1E0B33DCF277AE3E4
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x9D7FD1616C1CFED94C2BC78F2EA32D11
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0xA9215B69866FFB0B54038FE8E6305BC1
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0xD26F0A93E0BB6756833D2CCBC9B2D266

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0xEC0EA343029E7AD3077546F190F9ED7F
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0xC6E25012ABFB95B68D9798AEF3E23B06
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x513B21D3A8C3102856B285524FE49320
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0xBD143B25D6CA16AC4A1C2CA18E281695
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0xA972B931E59FADB945CABEE7822A40EA
with himself.
0xC46D3C500B2AD1BE64C2E2DDC0C33165

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xF7CC0054F29DB950DC7E2A1E53038A4D
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x9DBE44B78E0ACE3D1A08D86B9D6F31C5
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0xF9F01A122F212FE0C5D81D238F35DA5E
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0xA39FA265DF096EF559D8615F7FDA74F8
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0xD5F098F46CFAB318B4613EC8527D3F5C
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0x30E71B9FBA5CAA4D7AC42A4D944153A8
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x8387910091FAB88E17851A7635F383F1
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0xC4FFFDA4394EAD88274E4C9D2CAC0E5F
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xAD5B0FAF917FB5F77E1E8554BC79264F
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0x92DAB7067FFFB9B8D3949574860F1ADC
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0xE74F84011364B0F3CAFA790FDA77A2C1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x277C18635AF1FBCF7D27CB2220A376C1
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0x20A896B5EED1EBFF9783F81C64FABDBD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0xE43D733F9FB1D68424518D3E2C13C3CC
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0x7CCB439B5B1D67F1DBDBDF0A4392A555
ensuing year.
0x5966596556250FB754443D6E3F52A9E3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x5F123427EE8C13E3F7F8F80CC3303A33
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0x0E25DCF5CC2156DA46C625F008A87026
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xAE58328E59F05187116DF861574ED797
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0xDE4E4635167C2185115F956AF8C9C413

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0xC8DFFABBC35F63899A6F78CF08379960
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x041572B685029D3E189890AD028432FF
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x91866BA6EFDB141C02731987B640BAC6
yesterday."
0xDB7492017D4BC5A7F19700FC05196868

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0xD58A3A62699561FFAE6DEB476FE80DD3
he was serene as glass.
0x7A2D8995E94F425EEA147914FE2E50D4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0xAB6F58B4DEAC2680191B1B35B47F3543
known each other long."
0xFC5FE6D78862115CC0B90D1065264383

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x1AB84E2123B85ED56EC67D9909BAE74D
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0xBF6F3C213583BEFB0A794DAEC0E500EE
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x70875E5FD0EBE34AF99E10AF3462051A
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0xAAEEB66D417F3B44549E6F6D9106530C
can he refitted for their reception."
0x4D25A0D45BBCB0D54F09B9EC0CA00F13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x7185FF6F860AC1DAF112770765A4FACD
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x27DF5630E4F3074878B411C117AA0231
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0x33DE2E9A61D8E8C7C8EF78E13DFF8D3D
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x6ED95A501C0B8D9FDEBD6F80FBA38B9E
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0xB0E2F4699A20B1DC82AFD236B661ECD4
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0x94F53C9149B1A829E6A6ED0F9D1F28F2
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0xB00F9CAC0352F065230EAAC02A658992
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x82F43D35727CBD1A86467E441FAC40AD
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0xE0772163F93A74DA6B6CB39D40982889
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x520D72388691911A16F2AE4842B7B9E3
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x07D89C435C2C7379E8FFF96A64EF87B4
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x8B24548A8AF6D1A0AFE979E40FDE6EA7
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x8DA6AB87D23DAAE070D60F3F75578F4E
frigidity.
0xA64FE7C4A7F271932F1788C43D890367

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0xBDBE7096FDB226D9F459B589FD6C858B
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0xFC3FF8A5C3AE4B7966F07AEA9AF3ACB2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0xF8B41EA3568A26B92120C96B4978B636

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x7802733E5CF4BF3522212AADD3BB6C9C
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xBC3CC60690A43E3777BFCA3557A0633E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0xC1412C74DD869C93312576CC74201498
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x0A146D058002AC0D924F031FAC0B8D26

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0xA691C650D93289CE0910D2FFABC32E7B
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0x07B824AB2C0B7C6E903EAC5478D42151
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x65BDD932FBF6718F4B9F26896B12B513
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x61A37197BACA6D8EDCA660044FE4FBB9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0x8B6610C238AC280684ED2C0C5256DB56
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x3FC4F7D01ED8691284FADA490F213698
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x925BC013C4F3EF3C011AB57EAAC98BF6
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0xF02B411183159F3EFACE47B4AC288C7A
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x11840425D82D4FF0F6DFF7C8AB517627
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0xF633E3F0DEEB47BE4CD18EE2D552C8C6
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0xCE8DC219E943A701CA22D091DEC3031B
plans.
0x04EE3620CBED258BFB90F6E457EEF92C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x774ABE1764D1F30728030FD10A882441
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0x3D17A8FD02C72B257A8CA4A7D205F9B8
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x5BAB65B96B0A4C1458D70F0FB5D8D9F9
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x71D95C04BEC2C94DB5D4027D873E8416
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0xF57EC007C0D5F1980339B15D12528DA7
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xFFC6DE7D32C8AF79C34ADA56F5C44615
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0xF74BA7487CF97AF999ECF950596D33AC
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0x01578A89F746EC16A9F6F4AC6119D5B5
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0x60D229303F8601496830A6EC322103F3
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0x64869C5AB210BDAF2AC12A3B910D2706
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x314C76DD1572B68B3C681598D687AD64
the task without regard to the elements.
0x56F8DFF40E4926498BCF888E6B204DB0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0x83BDE1BD97C3E415823AE14BCDD1894F
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0xE078E03283547278B75BAFE6FFEE4BE3
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x53407D9D43E2F54FDD20F83DE9B0FAF7
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0xA0E383744CE8FFE35403CD3BDBD8B30D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x04C49FBB34C9C9E2598B736C0CB555BD
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0xCF790377302B8DDD7F5450DE83C97B21
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x767606409015C047E66877BB3E5C6E5B
was a special annoyance.
0xC966AA78AE0BD5BC58A7FDB385178DEE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xA124910CAD50A1C63BAD1DB161B3EA35
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0xEFD95894439D4C391F970FFC656FCEEB
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x5ED0189CC083F8B03AA55A90852CFC65
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0xA91A4AA65452C3305DA66183C433175B
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x5658BC42F75C2D00FAF3FB03016FCCE3
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0xC3096CDE7C407A53D710BB26D78E9580
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0x61698D2139E51600391BD39D06BD91FE
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0xA3DA31B50CC30DEBAB95238F64E2637B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0x437C892939433A5CB3D46FC80EF47C0D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Learning German."
0x845DC6DF11EB24AC1A7F4FF4059E2FBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x0DD5512D123DC95089586EA49541D077

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are not in earnest?"
0x7C91BA3E6824BFA4B7CA0A08D486ED6D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x9A6092A835655049F87032BE81ACFDE3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x703CCED7246EC88C10FD1566312C94A2
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0xA16F712335E0922A3C795F49DDD7A047
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x9B55D6DD12987D185A1A48B9F4BEAB06
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x23E9487AC3FFDF9F8566BE0874210ABA
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0x7C2E630042A0FA21D9D00EBAF2E267BA
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0x9E5D380C1B806C1488657109AD870910
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xD068B1D3FEEFF38259C950E18CE95032
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x29414C64A0CF497269098648E38F4A24
barely three months to his departure.
0x6E939B900725A518ED12E445CBBB18C8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x6F43FEE3AC16DEEF492AC20957C12FFC
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x91BECBE582E73B3FCBCC2EB446817621
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0xF1B278F5B1097E5D61429B24A8FF3FDE
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x093A605C1C1927389A6EF6D5969A78D9
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x510444B57098755415D04E84B49DB382
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0x17D577C09D4F462810414B63CD3820D0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I know it."
0xB2E45738AD0B8094AFA33A11B872D437

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xB764A612D4892B3DAE723938CCB9C999
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x3D6B54745C733A761FECCB12DABF879A
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0x3354E89FED2BEB8E20DCAB8011CC00D1
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0xC100804AFF6971D01872D9700E7997E1
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x17E5F1369C6E430FF7D273848AEC9C53
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x2A5D99F91052CFE5920E915642E0C6E2
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x05D1B3C72D0CF4DEC26EC8E2AF15AF4F
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x1F7C2577F2E9F2DF97C4C410E64D9AA5
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x8116DA366A7503E1F4224667D0DE9F1A
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0xB654A583B98698DA76DB51B31D8BE1FD
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x4984FD2409AAF62D6DC66B0EB30FF489
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x74AEED2945040DB72B8B21FF4F03FF54

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0x4B2439F3E41D57F85AC4AA267F432759
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0x8EAEDD0D11698BB0D4897C219664852A
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0xD1E6BCDEF5598F61F4D8A66346A3402F
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x5046F6122721AB606C3690CB278B7F51
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x3D66DCAF981068BC8F05C4CE0DF7C550

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xBA7B2F9040A4EE9598DE297B4870DDBA
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x75E187D1D76C5784C54950A424D0C013

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0xECE1B76905D6B10C7086E9EF185264EB
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x56239F843C74698C1CA94FCE0C0BD262
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x249F01AD879AF54CCC3718AF5E5A64FC
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x0246D28EF6BB5DE16F4F52261FF20375
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0x5F372B6B193B6981A23D956A607BCA9D
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x0B817BC8D08A5996B2D340B34A6DDF39
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xB1BE0356CBC1D3DC2FDBD475C2D759F0
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0xA912C793B79FBCAC341A0792820277AB
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x503F1534D23F65E2213D290F6A5074C8
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x46D3F6258F11FBE8B2D1E9B696BF929F
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0xF4A1A36694EB907229DB20DA6DEDD2AC
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0xCE79074EF499589AF9B9920603F7D0BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x8AC5FF6FFED77E890E948C15C807B075
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0xA1E2CBDC6B61392ACED8D830CA9771CF
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xC9308818E511EDBEDB2BF9664020248E
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x57A6AC0AE888B22C8EC74E050279811E
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0xFD30D3F8D94C856D7C4A6872E2D92FB4
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0xDAAA9EC3760E40F9CD3E723F78D67CBC
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x26A39221037A7F562F0A04442DA6B608
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x2C5642843A4146ADA596ED295DA53B59
own.
0x6F3A9E03E28C0C2F9A75C204F693391D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x8A753EB9B4579A11CB8F33E7BB20648A
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x85E4FD5AC164A40197E08792589E0068
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x4F687FD1A8ABD521B3DED118C311C869

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0xAA046D8C2779A58137DA104043F52A55
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xCE0A25444A4F2569F2676A55A3FF750B
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x2BBEA87E2A72102DB19CB979E20ED371
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x1C125BE8E072DF7BA833EA3C478FB055
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xA7C3DA857E5C566C0F145CE8ACF65EEE
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x9251878D2EE695B4E13015D8E28E8330
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0xB58B08F0BF3EB56606C482D894C3BD0E
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x2EA3FE71226A92F3BAB5C27696D9733F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x4D4C7B5C31B3B1FD05D200769204857B
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x8D60F15FC41B823ACA73D2CC6F5F364F
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xE2BEF5793E37247441132E7EE217B905
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0xDD1734E08A828DCF3FFD2A62A9AA5FBB
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0xAAFFA5E2AEB1222CD951E066A77C0282
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x16F1B245E66C7274A1E8916FE32B8AC0
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x01994593EE418E46B815CC4DC045BDC4
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xC231282207402FDDF5C35BAEC40B5843
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x71E323ABF38C76ABDE5BBFB57DA1595B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x965E3F4B2C0F493B9FA409D19DFF710F
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0x52A033128D233F3DBC5013D1A938A761
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x0AB144351A629243596642007759C793
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0xCC875E6D991218A3748B71D86E29924B
then I felt dark indeed.
0xAD7FA64E321074D330BF1943FF0FF901

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x3815200A19F4E9B4F2BAA2F792FF5C02
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0xA1C809205B27432ECF72517E4282CC2E
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0xA0CE07F993AE2C804DAA38189CCFE1BC
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x34AF07095CBC372CB4E66E912946629B
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0x05F0A7CBCE9AF58D7B6F081ABF63815E
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x8295C123ACDD7A4A41756D6DD883A5E6
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x5FFA87A3685B6DF3C985F9997F3A4D69
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x73043E33E37A276125D52BEBE402CFCB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x487F4DF47F731D4E051CC88018823E8B
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x1C400C3C13C9FB503D40C3D39A3FC4E7
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xED55DC3A518B49CEB5BAF71CABB2BB93
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0x5023DE480BD326614A4C119BD38CEF40
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x5DA0027EF6DB50C964C52B266980ED3E
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x9733DCDC40548794DF0EC3E5F20938BF
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x2801F79318771749E82D7ABA54BD892F
eyes filled again.
0x8A6168FA9697E31FBACBB98296BBA320

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xE699AB6430AB01BC1E4C389D827A4FF0
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xB84F4942D6EE615C3ABBE6B7B32B2222
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x712CD322645D13876406490450905E25
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x5495E2F7CC1F89FE7255674B36AC7352
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x14D8C70EDB3577D79F785F70C4217D43
as to its cause; he only said--
0x8822D4B1E82120420B0801277B8C1ABC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x5D99023B300CF1EC22326CDE2DB9F169
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x19484319B8A4808C4E0452DF3B0DE9A4
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0xC5FFA2F0D014452C103182B0632D1308
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0xA6AAE46FC5CACD3E9E2D0CBD8CACCAE8
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0x08676BC9819F57ED188711634FCBF074
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xDD892B1AA189CC81F0676D53F873410F
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0x026451444A6C62D75A3B2EC89A62A33C
said--
0x5DF3BA679382660319CD85B7EE8D54E9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xBB5868966087C75BCFD46BEC7911714E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x8ACCE1A83E26745E8E504F97AD0993D6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x7AFCE1EA68D2550AF7A9DB1B2031F7AA
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xA0F252C8C1B2B802BB34D533707A0A5A
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x7503B66F26FCB9E9C828CBCD587EF0FD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0xF94A69FCDBC3A1C3E84B59A555AFE697
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xBB9F52F36923C4C2D9DBB92BAD790C05
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x1EFD951164FD0458921D9E4ABFE3BD96
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xF53F04F641CCFE94AADC3727091C8FB7
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x2502FCE319ADEEF1637CC147F141EBF0
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xBA3064FDF5082C13C64515C402044FE0
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x3B0CC0728F63AD4253CC4998EC532916
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xFCD9BD3675528C6BE3D456D7F040FD43

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x5227235AB5C4F6B3E7503BAFC2E5ADD5
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x6D08483E7E68EFD0EDDA626D007B394B
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0x7691C1066C17F59BEE668F4D9778B8B8
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xCEB5B77F2F92B4D97BB0D0F9E3CC1104
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x1F93903E2294EC090496AECEC25647B5
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0xAE7446C1F713B717942E94CFFCDD3FFC
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x4F711469AD323708B4F936AE6246D6FA
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x1304852CF4724695652ABE819E2F0DAF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x7879283D491FB18A31B5850BD078DEE4
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0xB721F877B5140573D35BB9E44D86B127
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x5BA3F63B7652CB6996B8EF6141EA63FE
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0x632FEB8085D5AC93B989D3F18363E33D
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x795C9ADA60C3AA577FFF0B1CBA525EEA
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x63AD3FB3D571D2A66E003484946F67DE
last refuge for silence.
0x908491D9D4B81B848F2BF1C885D8C45F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0x9D4D663E635FA94154983659CE1AAE98
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0xB2B5C571475C5CC2C34B0555BE8C7B04
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x7DA24BF7A700F29105CAC04671EF29E8
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x7F4EE19DD98EA0FD52045574D95A4D90
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0x5D661F3E746A6B2BC6B6B644B325650C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0xBAE487531A775526E9B09A2A67647EA5
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0x914C7681533E219F4F7703EBABEA532C
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0x1E15B1DC0ED93775DED0344CCA6EB5DB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0x125FDD8E857ED77E980DE4F378C71B0F
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0xAB523F7969601E27F998971ABDC8B0A3
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0x81D94869F3A1B330BDF356DD014B8EDC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0xA07E1929D22B27B96B5E50783677E8F6
sails on the 20th of June."
0x17505E3524E488744C32D0848D89AA80

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x4DC6567E1411A5E994B38EB2F54D6D4A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x73AC8E51D8903D68C5280789235D29D8
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x39E4BAA672E6EBD6805A8922525B205C
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x92D97FE9D0CE4B0D321A95135EAA5FE6
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xE090CDA3C6C01C7F4B42DF2BBA9DF0E0
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x2CAA6EEA5487E23687370D4DF3299278
same enterprise."
0xCEB91373B542A215A144E590A14581E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xFD38FE20068826912E632F5D8B67B7BD
to march with the strong."
0x68C4EF60523C941C6C821240A176E0BC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x174FDD461BCE37A7BB49183142D4A69B
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0xA737D3496AA593B236B0675E764F17E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0xC64FE2505A7B038CB090CEC263F8614D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x3192FC8B59C2F575563CB1E3B66EEFC3
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0xFE1CDBD2B7FAB6751C7BC920B89A567D
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0xFD594D12DC1096107E83319E35EF4A76
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0xBE49F31360C0ED8C99A58EE669BAEDA6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0x33BD86FDC2ABD2038805907DA4B8714B
the first to inform them of it?"
0x6534018B1DA24EEE262FB0B6F9B16159

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0xBB56D814AA46931C7AE01533106677A3
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0x85EE460A0C5E314A5E9C87303FBE4A80
rivet the spell.
0x95AC9284976427730F2B2A79943BC38B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0xA39BDAD784663FEDB17B57FF264185AA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x261F870BEC4D1A74A2F2E1EBB66DD704

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xF76CF2CDF04C42B17234B91C2728F593
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x69B6877C4ABE18E1D7506C5B887BE21F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xF70C9883CA06F6E17C1E8B6703FC6630
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x84C0D7D9BD92D70B38CA979028DE3242
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0xA5409ADE73E492A8F0479CE57E796BAB
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x22F8758C742518D16F1AFEDB9A9E09ED

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0xD58AC6CC9163076FDD060F07687317FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x61B5DE60CB780E6FF6A090A6F69A4439
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0x10D2B0C2DEDCFE8427A4A63541BE57FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x5671A2BE8E75EB90F4D70F5252BF3CD3
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0x5413C2D6DF7B34540E94C8569C18D1E2
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0xA405E2FE64DCDEC0DD4B704924A61CA1
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0xF12C5642032F1E17FA1B31CA0B44355A
service."
0xCBBD56A6D97F0E6E570FD0E11ABCF4D3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0x30D8D69BE78677526015D73045665625

He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xBE79A4E1E91AD01233C316E0D1A4032A
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0x43221473D80060399774C14DBAE91653
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x9E7EAE329FDA2A5C216AC6440AD59C8E
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x83A45932BE12FB83A312001276F3BF88
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0xA5F8F15B7E49AA4F4A6DC139A848193C
for him.

"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you

0x081918B3EACC2095FCECA28541C29548
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x7D9E974B4F3B87F65634533FE59D58D7
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x01E33400744C3FBE711FF6DAD1A2F585
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x96ADEA3603CCEBA7A51E3EF2C1638B98
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x10172A3BA424769ACAD987F1461B04A0
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x79582BD7415F843DA93B8369C2AF83B5
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x513EEC77B2287CA0D0FA6F905DA1BCC4
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.

"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xD89ACACC1BCEA71E4EEB105E855C91C4
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x6686A0EAC37E72F55B3EE0D30B7B3508
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0xB7547DD64A3422CAE46D341180F0D8F4
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x28E0C9A3D6D1DFAEFE0C501139894D4E
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x4F3D413D6281C2B1A3E8CC766360B8A0
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0xAB80B1CD1FF1850EA5FFA1351EC96BE0
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xC7FEDFA8C7F36F67336512593382587A
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0xF7F2596D010A14B77EAF7ADA57B04444
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x15D0F9C6F0AA3D561C5F9359E8528790
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0x8E42AC871A6786BB2BE19323EDB21131
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xFBCC0A17E2C71619E5CC28F4C24F5F38
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x60F4B75979C2D675EC0E0D516F018E7C
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x44EAE67EB3E9946B124E8EC777B5139F
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0x419E0D703BEE246D5D906B449F91A070
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0xCA83F8DF0D96CDF808A5D06A5B4554D0
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0x38AE14265FAE270927CCB6823489CD76
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xEEB1F329205318FCDAD897CA87A8B76D
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xB05764BD589F44F0847AA90D6C3A77AC
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x85DA98A8FDE87A179270FF9BE193BBF3
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0x74C63E8002905A7967F2B86336030211

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure

step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x329879767EFD76C7FAF89FF5C3BF8D23
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My

work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed

itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping

hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to

"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge

that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x8043A85CC1FB39EE9C586AFF1C469622
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x8570CE6A2DC466E4077A589FBDC989D5
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x6D84F4FB18F8137F9946E784F40E87EE
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0xFB7AB22321D36795BAAFD8DABB9E7BF8
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x5A63C5F8FEDF89765AE39A8141454415
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x6A350EB7939BF2618BFA15E12B5A10A8
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0xF7E84949DC0FF604ACEB03D8646BDD56
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x39B168D5971DEAD90BDFCD751E8E311E
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x09CCF0198003E4EE8024EB0D8B8BDAA2
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0xA477111B8451CAEB58BC9E68D358BDF1
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0xAAF1CA2734F905BEDC68031848C39CCA
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0xF4709C2430018E6C8DC1F699B4C4EDFE
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x1E576C7C4216B184E45CF333BB7C145B
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xA7D7983758A3E4B956B318DA5A007F4B
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x6CEFBB187D46FD2B0D9E09E5CD377A22
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x76DD8320A655531A50CA0A15F6C80928
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x6512C7ED525C97B28C41E56B23D68AC8
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x0AB8F93A1BE53DE34F486310C5356D4D
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x928BAABBBC81FED0687D3F18BB30D1A1
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x1BE7D4B12230CDFE982E1520FB0B1F01
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x8C6DAEADAEE9506968370464B67AAD9A
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0x721010E386E5D54E7F010239919DA9E4
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0xCA4FBABD70741F1576CF03D6E12E7EF7
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x399EED5E911265B5F9A4DC67E056CCDE

"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful

item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x53768F35B1D44C36023D27D2981A00AC
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x2AAA1AB5FE1E77045C0DA2DEB87A6C93
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0x0A792D1E4745B26BCE81D5FAD9284FFE
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0xFEE1441958A8BB13E8C1E179F08B4F90
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0xA957171EC840782D1307F31479CFB28A
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the

bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xD5C2C977165747C37180BB7E89D57FDD
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0x0A8EAEA75F82F244CE9F7A373A4E6AEE
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x44EEF6478AED5443048B0C98A290A19A
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will

He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you

were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no

marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to

0x0EBFB2CE77D59DFA6121378F38AE1935
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0xA8380FFCE4ED10911B61D94F35656DC5
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I

God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x7176486F584B4F8A6B9B4E99E9F18C1F
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0xA6F943A8C984CA711CB368BEA4DD547D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0x2FAC032FC7ED8E60BDC33E60CB0D05C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xB4889100289038F5DF39889E7727734C
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x6BBCB4381FCC90A41A699B4BABF3A0B7
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0xAA84BAEEFC7D123906F278A4DD7DE321
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x1992FEF4E295498574857F796EA0B9CB
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0xBDB481818CAEC14854C1572FDBD88222
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x8963BDDA10209A348E4CECAFB6C17BA0
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x30B5F1D6935C2DB7448A27A6063B5D94
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x34D58FAEA3525AB681890A5770B80616
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x6DBFD854699D755BF3F05B0D127870E2
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0xE2FB9DFDD37A1D18902261555373B098
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xDE959569612B753F89538E5D803F1BE3
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0xCEB1F7F66208CE5FB587C26783479866
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xE829DEB2D5875F5897E2FC4C2149DE6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x78EECACA96CD263C112B8EE9CCB397AC
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0xC2FAA867CDD6624BDB1D92B2193EEBAB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0xAE4F4E9F6D29F51CEF59F64107079F4F
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0xFACE2DECFFAB9CA94F4989C85C65B165
this signify?"
0xE42AF8907D8343B970F6EAFAC60F2600

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0x4B0FEEE4A519D8C23C5967017898AE6B
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0xBDCB87DFB7369F13A4C37352F1DEB3A3
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x486F1E2C3D2DD4A0F977529B159F988E
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0xB796D66147B82FED06AA2FC3EDC3F890
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x99F094240A9FDF9A40B165EDD47A2BC6
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x155CE569990BFF29AB3DB11EE7BB3A1E
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x7D64C9B337B4867B6E14C1C8500C0393
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x44325D28A7CE389780EF77C6FD667E27
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xF7EBEE798F3EFD438A593FA2D7BE2AC1
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0xCC52A7B2178F3C255A177EE002FC079B
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0xC21D00E8DE937D284C9F76550120313C
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xC0F3F724879442B2B119A808F0D96CBA
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0xEF2CDDE1394BE13B62DD719680FD5B19

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x291EE01A4A22233F7A3CB204521982FE
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x442070A8828835BA64F5A40B3106F856
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xAADAA8C0B020F652934D48AC385E257A
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0xE2A93C1503C27A10C4B56CF633B255E6
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0xDED10B919BB272F817F823D89D086978
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x3DBB1CBD3012CA1ACEF1F254B04F0355
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x5CB7FF15F258AC35297D291C8D6D177F
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0xE79141ECCFFED58C78A032B79AB9A85B
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0xFE8D83F05221E2DA67BFA1C1FE276402
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x0B68DA866BDD4A2A836C8EC3E48AA897
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x3D26526B203C492250B26D2DEFED0D0F
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xFD9AD096128608BFB8B20F0D60844780
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x7CA7E8157B280945F0653EA227E5498A
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x48B265AEDB87D71C2618D79CE58F28AC
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x9365398B5CBC43CC8E95C76AB08C37F4
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0x65AD35F4DC06CB7F6497E0EE5F12E3DB
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x66FC8D3AA023A029C1D601AE58204D50
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x65649318CD1C48456089C1E8F58F65EB
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x0F5715E6077755C9EEFBA87B670AFFF6
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x2843F27628B718602A89FEEC3ED9D88E
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0xCE44D8E7A11C904D013C146160C053B8
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x62EBFCB228F7C7B7855A757E7C420E7A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x4E65141345DE637CA3E550E56D1A697C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x5E6FB0CD89BB9725BEFC60844B32711E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x8EE50443508CCF25C4064DEFEC4DB28F
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0x01DC6D4975C05C6A822B6937593DF24B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xE5CA9B67EDD48390EECFE819132DBFA7
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x6F3E8A413D31A109BBB4D271C972B341
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0xA10E5C5DD7226D95753DB64E1D025BDD
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x3BE6BF8729FA87C2BF7592BDDAF6C9BD
tribes--and unwed?"
0x270F1CC4BAECE7A4EB15D8FD98C87197

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0x1FB13A48A20C04BE9905660784EEA5EC
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x5E42F924161DE1C4846FF62ACAD2BBEC
yourself."
0x1D88E010B45690639AAA90FCA1E7F9F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x0A094A71E2C1B783AE242A328DBE65C7
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x84F962493A3E197A3AFBE7116F664078
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0xE9059B2E89633D7FF207645E74405F09
heart and--it would not do."
0x229127CF57A96FD1410BBA2F03406DD3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xA605713F662D486015B58B9F8CA7EEEF
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0x64AE534F96767487E1448B471B475C90
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x33E205D7FDA163D617CDCBBD2101E5B8
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x44AC88B72770A4EFAD2292CCE23B3BF8
nothing more--don't fear."
0xFE22478CE01E775E72EEEB2888CD557E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x821991FB9068BE54C8C1DA7EBFA27733
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x0312117300BCA6BAA6814BA925DA229E
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x4D27818CB373C3FD0404B86E931B55BD
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x38FFA0EB66E7EB959D8C01D7FEB8AD1B
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xF6EE7C519B569F859A9B20F085627872
eyes."
0x2995A6454F7AA1FEAC1EDC0279840997

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x139B7F69B015D7EB0367A88B7DADC51A
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x1BD04604D87FC819C2F6D72E27D418E6
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0x5043AC938A3B33763E8F594D9AB18F97
offer it."
0x124123E236BF4477288430EFE519DD9A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x472EA57FCABD0638ECD4D88EA3496430
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x749F8201CC1AF9D06810DFEAC9AAFA17
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xCDA7DFE43DD983EBB265309FB33B9140

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x0DC782F972288863D20821D78055F884
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0xE37D0A00E8AEC6674F938A9555959E4B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x85CCD1EE71F864F498FFE7C8B868BE57

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x9F156F6C8669EE1B7010CA65B2055A6F
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x2C09B4FCF7E870856862A237C7656D86
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xE99DA144B05334433CB462C813B5C2A3
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x9ADAF2C4F9573281460F0E3AF9C3618A
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x1ECFD0DF855D7F4063D4F1299E0C90B5
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x7F4155E3E78D39B07AB6B10C3E76B9F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x1D69AEF222AD15EEADD2FAD3C56D1BFB
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x704F0D1671A73655A4E08BB5F37265D7
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x26BC78C6CEED65398F38C7631E45D137
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0x82B02593A25EF706DAC05F065C00FDF3
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0xA7C07D668F032A4177377F3D069EF7FD
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x800C78EEC1DB326D514FE8B8A9E66D7B
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x9694E9DACCACFF3E47F724EB6E61A28D
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xBF20BC59BE93CCAA20479AA47312969B
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xA03795572A927448BF79F4EC171B62F3
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0x64278078D1D72FE6C60CFA40565E4295

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0xD6C9037E55C2FD071AE5BD6F5521D5E2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x6D598837D1E9A9BC02BC4B535D6D0C3A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0x58DEA2BB9FBA2A4CE46774A7C35C0DBC
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0xF8F05CE9EF58AA55203D6E4E2AD3A38D
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x45A97A41663102DEA03C5EE7F3F6C23E
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x21498879DEE9993E6689D5B6DD1A90E5
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xACE791FCEE17BF6E2A5D8A08BC44E926
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0x90918F7F5DDF35D1633A107B0E40510C
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x9F15C554EC73183715E1243C68E5D57A
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0xB831E9D5AFF124119EA0886A3ECA2675
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0x8091A572FEA7B13CF05298482DF1B4B6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xE45F3E65FDCB51E8C36759E556E047DD
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0xB81FA61EBF3A2D283DDA054C2E5BF8D9
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x2FCDC862EC3A9F40337E5B362CC16F81
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xC1366530B3153213B146B4EDE7652190

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0xB2A20BA0468B52B13D34802E1C6957C9
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x29F24F77D59F0DAAB4D66D6A81F32F73
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0x4AC5141561EDF293C2294E9E27CB361A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x4F01D43C2C97CA86E770388CF6E5DBF9
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xC081C63B85555322377849BF625496E4
stairs.
0x91CBB875F182621A748830FE84E18D79

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x97FC452D7DF897242E6EEB49C3DAC967

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x7EBEABCAEBD36CA0EEBB9960262EB187

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x1153089F9B979E6CAE860C92148F4F27

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0xEB6BA08F0ED7B02B726651914820B6B9
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x572E46CD658E7C477A2714C0C26548C1
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0x04135509114E1D3FD0DBE89E7731CE86
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0xF133BBC119B22B1428A258C5EF019B79
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0x16D6B55E990C0B3F5047CE1541BC3B50
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x63A889BF3C20675E6D1C314179B4F9E5
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x09C31296E56B3EBB8100ADBE9A8AC83C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me

CHAPTER XXXV

He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xA27C2F941E739EF9C4986AC38AEECE82
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0xDDDA3CC9387FB6E075C127FC0DDD7BE8
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x1ED1F566E04EF65CF9F7EA2CE812AB71
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x0FEC20AD2DDADBA26FE654EBB03B05E0
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x8EF4A99EC9F5031375A3BAC859B32D40
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x373808EF8BABA1AA602FCE6A5216507B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xB0A3E57A668E875DF96070DED33FBB20
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xE9DFEA5520DA9E38603CD7DE2E7CEE26
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x9C005FAC29D53E211A748E0F0E268628
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x57378BD77CF3ABADC94C31D14D61D025
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x5ED99CC56248908360B04F5E15871BB1
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0xFF5C2CD7DAD84B2C7997B3CCC7837981
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0xC13D47D7793C58B885420E9ECBAE1486
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x14387752DE162CEE5D70DB0D9EA81E1E
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x1E2918F53C7BF0A0A96DF060A9F407EA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0xD41C8EF863EE5E1CE3CE77C60376B189
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0xFF17EC4F748FA300BB38D42824544B0E
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x09B094980A7DCD980426A77868AA7D9B
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0xDE1A3BAF81848EB3222955EE746C3DBE
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0x05719F569B7AA5CE9D5B0B7ACE02ED60
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x56FC495DC51B3CE37042A5862060F5AC
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x7788914D7F8F0FD288EB62ED3B9AAC4F
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x595A6C282F2DDD682359E8ED364C0F46
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0xEE9526E09DC47305F5FB8CA20A1A0663

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0x9C4FCC4A2F9C00145AA0AF9FC146F871
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0xD512457B0B0248A7232BEC14BA32744F
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x91ECB993904F3D3D078ABF41847C054E
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x354F4A1C9B728D9A0328717C5B64DE81
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0xD4C15E0DF9347B02725A043F7B6A4F35
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0xA25FF4B0791C5B01E56A0CFED3A7DF49
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x6B18255032683B02D2B932287FFC8E7E
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xE32EE0A4A123414934AF34FD0324C505
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x2730DF4202C9C874A4734960AD9C8580
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x30028F23C8A1512A2F31842EDB58AA6F
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x5F8CF50081D56FC5B21F18DD5F680B50
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0xC042EDAE2E45EA6226BDC24A373E109E
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x1ED615307FCFEBF5F3CB8FEF4674F37E
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x3E9B7D9498E29AD26EBA121736EBF0AA
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x6F85E91256EA1C50FECC4C8AD4EC83FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x11C032E0450A9A46F7C45A616257C991
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x9DD96D360D1255AAC7CFDB5957D22B6C
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x9A845395A74AB07D10C5A960DB312540
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0xC3FF7D0FB0C3B4C95DB3CBDFE73F9E97
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x417A0E9CBB9AF51A2E43C6B1553250A7
spoke to the point at once.
0x15B0AC73DDC7985E2ED360C7BCEA5705

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x5F65FAA885050611DE6A93A750212492
friends."
0x314FC552569A7019863F445711A1D4B1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0x190DF88DA65C62CF408B27F038D99B91
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x3FAB8F17BEB2C30A5F0F5C372508CCAB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x472F98837607BD6303D3DADADF24FA5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x4C3CDFB91E408BC6063F8B1B0F1FA52C
good."
0xD2EB159B3743FA617D9B9E2F7F3EB8AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x2FFCA5DDA29D57C21D8499A0DBD06691
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x69791CE5A3206CA6C9580B075B0DD118
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x66AAE0B5E7CD0D20D18F32325B58632E
strangers."
0x3B2E566F5EC01B9D5270B67F93359F6F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x6E974ACC0AE77293F65CB846F7CF82E8
regarding you as a stranger."
0x82959BF3A4A155BE93C6A41A0C343266

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x8FA048EB64461D6AC69CFCC2C8FFF671
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x296C3D4AA2E8FE6FA03C137B0467FC5B
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x33041C2309002C3A417EC1B8A643FEAB
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0x12F4DD55CF6AE10176CBF01ACB74D9C1
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x70EB583285DCE87C9511AE92FC3B5660
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x53E6A009243545BA1A03BD4671A3AFD0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0xE285BCDD3193B5DF70FD3E98A4F8B393
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0x88632A89C48D166ECD5D5BB78DFFA1B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x34C55DCA3A4BF5F19F53695D29023FE8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x4B863B98E5244BAD2882836E4B6388DD
India?"
0x1ED067403928039B3D7DCB1AFF796157

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xAA4564C46B605F1A7D3C5D87A24F0839

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x3418EF42978A1806EFF269C20F08E1AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x5F0CA5852AA3EB212C05ABB41F6CB2DF
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x6F4A74CCF51B53BE2A5DA3589CDFE73A
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0xAD02D9234A052153D891D18C99172F68

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x522BA121A6E24DD89328210781879007

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0xBF47A25D695B2722CF93D53AAF8EC7ED
crash down.
0x7BD782E927320CA9EA671EF7AE895AB8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0xD6850FA504AEB36B523E05EDA6B0D18C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x6028372F482C89FD0274B0C7ACB4217F
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0x3E9EF89B47AFD338FD7D61182344CA21
You are killing me now."
0x6EBBDC8DD90CCFFF4E376B7F2EF07F32

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0x44A55964CFDE26F1E2D32336727B6155

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x71A4E6A6FE40382BC4768079BCEDC4EF
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x2459B7DAA6B9F86CA9AC7CDFD99F56BA
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0xE8328401D2407C2FF11C5FA14C94374D
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x34A6D080250E5AB144BB3654E1801625
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xAC66100E031846C99F8BC6648862E347

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x7B4BCDFACDFEE0D2926F1D82030A5BC0
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x46902073971E47967D70293F55838FDB
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0xB76B710C1D57BB5ED1780D3B77EB08E6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0x5A86DA1D0F34163B86280A73F39E7505
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0x5C0AF923FBC7A98B797978A8F4D47B47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xA3E005CBC8B70DD5BF6EE6E7802351AD
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0x4ED2AEE464F259C893C9EDA95E050B83
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x541EE4C82B6D984E93BC228843BF5939

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xE2929E35CD1D84966D2FEAB264FF37FD
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0xB4C5BC8630F74A95E2D39168D43F5B91

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0xAFF0C5E2E0390D248218EA0C7BBE1BF3
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0xB60EAD32CE3A827C96D2C39F4EEE5372
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0x2696E4AD816D8B2F4297A288E653BC7E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x559896D2C0547D88BB714052824567D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x7FA1D8EB6F5AAB961944056B0B3324E9
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x6583331066A9A671F5085A959C1DD8B0
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0xC2ADDA1C4D2DE1E58594F9EC7B15C44E
spoke at last.
0x6977EC5A313165429F2755C7962EB4A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0x61361122199ACB3FC69A024676118C6C
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0x1720E874BB6EE340C21EC243C4F2A286
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x737C1DFF783EB7CAA52B0E62F01B7699
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0xF2195B973E19436A5575AC5B9284A7D9
sake."
0x8EBE38509828CDA322BF618F1A766616

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x60C3E430C69D3B5EA373155450ECC380
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x2F402D99FA8044D794455866D71EEB8B
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x366FAFB532329F51D7296913E548CBED
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x84C9784B90D93749F5DE92EFB025D317
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x9DB25EBD0E8BDC5BEE10A589172C2326
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0xA383C728DCAC3906018D7D218B290480

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x11D40130F05245074F64DC5FC0DEE649
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0xC2D416BA7030668CFFE5803AE4B13E42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x2C17DD034F08B352268807292B5BCD82
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0xEE1564BBC1745AE1DD21C937A731D2CD
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x92E495407D4E4C0740091C6CA1307734
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xCC6CDC981B5D1E41C3777BBE480E3A04
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0xD4059472D0B7048D3F9B448B8388FB1E
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xEA823B5D7AB1A5B9185D09773E93993D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0x45A8117619F33210D7FE262E3D404121
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0xF54E4AA2B9033BA494057A7C39CED654
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xD2B99439D3F3BA9DF392C2468E34BD2B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0xD47998F450F0D164DB868D42CC9C1C31
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0xBDCBB3CC640B194AB185350CDE754A48
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x3EF5B37E9C55B6BD5BA22139E6805F3D
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x7623B5AA5B4BA766505E6FD2247C36B9
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xA581CB77B724C8F4C3992BF9EBA98649

"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish

me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.

"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on

which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by

to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed

On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xA3DEDD03333B81585275D9B44B8C4B5B
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0xEAF4F8D79BA3CEC5F4511D6ACFEA282C
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x8020496E6E6CAC784C3441FAEB13090B
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on

hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must

forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And

you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a

fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0x845A83A30F8BD303DC7844826EAC5D5C
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x8028790B13F052F09DB08B12B800B71E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x29BCB6D2D8D681DF6AA48F9FE8130D4B
as his sister."
0x2A7209035923C944853DA31973C42416

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x7540D28BFCFD88341198855F5E5605F1
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x29A4FF7410D72F90D026CF38F71CCEA5
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0x59F12DD1AC303863DEF2F0D4E77AD477
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0x50729FC2E70B86BE318E5132436C982B
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0xF05455BB9511A904BB0FAA87D41012CB
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0xFBC420569C92FC5A01166684EC9CE0B8
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x95F96142D993C6B24E97BCCB54FBB464

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0xFD612549410827E3ECD7812E89FB4FD0
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0x36176071D61916F16B5F32B40D002646
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0x5805994874C71E603181637BBB486F20

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0x4BC37E08EE918FF7EE59C68F84960B90
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x37D954359813A8894233B95AA94A67F8
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x0DEC26ADA68E8CF8158B3C6E352AAA0F
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x986D669E0253584C51AAF9296F5539EE
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x3A77C1C70895699F4E0D5EE337666B76
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x1971B6D18B44B98BCA0C7D917559F7B5
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0xC1784F79EDB69089B7D0A62A91DAA7AF
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0xFF8713408BD95CE5778361DCBD600A8D
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0xB4DD0AB8B0449817539E635749DB85AD
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0xC43D31C4C3D8FD75BE4483748BB3A7C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xD5D2BC91AB6D6914E182CDD054CD23EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0xA0893AFA12633895678B07A1D97D20E1
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x19B98AF8977E6AD539FA9CEFF07A1170
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x36E26048D1398A97680C060DEE5B7A20
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x9873D03D2BB68278365DCA0B0B494879
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x2BCBE9A544F73400C2B6419622301B0D
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0xDF442842EDBF18B5F1EE37A05A5F1DE9
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0x77E6590079CD1EC821A663BA29C27CE3
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x4BD69BA09F884D39013EA871EA0796EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x29CD24EAFA01A7F37B9A403E699F179D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0xA627969F9E777EE750E18847E8D9441D
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x8E67F75B8791087B9C36C2D2BE5C993F
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0xEE5E2EEF1718E92D7171A76FD29C0707
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x93DFB3AC0FCEC2A9C5049226C6275E5F
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0x0C76E002DBDBE3B9D1984E8F33E97B27

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x847C9F18675116F8FAF304105FF46054
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0xAF300D2D3A5942C109D220353A3FF3A3
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x26761EB22F6E75984BA9FAFD0874139F
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x6A477B1AB353F9AA9021DD4FC2CBB69E
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x032ACB5AFDFA9DCCF7773383DE908C9F
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xD56F58B9C1F1CF553CFC444B5918F804
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x0CC3C020C41BD11319535E6D30A83880
had forgiven me once more.
0xB3EB9C55415B5B1B5A84B980AEABC14D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x5F0B58FD90A845D578AEF58939ED98B3
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x56E6F2D205B177045898259E56AEDD94
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0xC754DB6F8D920D55A3C2887777D2CB4C
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x565604676AD7EF77687E672F9B3A6111
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0xD6EB9EE3EF29C6E72BD26A16F369E541
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x5C7AE7F810C0D2203C26E36C67711C50
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x7C08BA7E98683B0D9C46D28757415AC7
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0xEB5492809EF619BE55F701B585D68EA2
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x7A42F156FC88C8355FB940F6A8113105
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0x8FFDFB592A04C6EA1BAC83744E8FE30C
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0xFE4D338A3190AF6FFF66B8D45E067061
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0xF08DFDF17154E859C9DBC26A8F700489
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x5D1931BCAD8332628398A7BB09C24EE9
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x390A29D9E0AD4DE6DF766A10B415E76A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x96B1B160DD8CA28D2665811FEDDFB64C
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0xDAD4589F20B4390B9A4769427DBDF420
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0xF0A8BFCBA77EBFA1EB695084D8F3920D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x5BE7E03DB67DC95443FF0863C77C07C6
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0x0CA032BADE8A3DC5DC78F1A3139F8DE3
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0xE15FCB7D373A44CD8890B01AB0681D7C
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0xCCD6768420EE0D1369496EB809CDAEC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xD57699B6F8397EC7E0FF2808225B4C36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xBBD8A24F30FFF494CE9110EACAA371C7
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0xB048E56D8D06CEB76B039540793B59F0
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x718C0408484661D6326C29EBEDC8A04D
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xD1BC57996C6F4C0E34200F1C91343EC4
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x3B2A4850F8332452826C72F7D59289FD
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0xB33AA9520C0729CB19B17F074E104C2A
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xD70C7A7EC63E8FB4FAC343332AEFBA13

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x3B0BC86000133328146B0FE3F0E1620A
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x6508F0432119EF12402D3E71C705FF5F
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0x8D071CB71949CA9C9DC02DF834CA3429
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x81C342AC49FA01AD84E622778DD8635B
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x5846CAD908C5BE4B37A9F95A7B22A4B9
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0xACCD0D7EF93F8AB7B1DA4856BE988C66
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0xBCB20DCC5C179BD0BB7929A6366DD83E
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0xE2D11DF8DD5B038D602547FCE4C90835
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0xD7435B91832E32C8FA9E29124F8D9D4A
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0xAEE45248225F0817A9434D07D247C6B8
could not but feel it too.
0x061F39D013766FD704EE3491BE699B46

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x46C32786CA20321C36FF9BAB117C1E08
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x66D02ACF5CB28BB99CE32BD4053EC62C
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xA76AF37F6300C21D3777E8FA65F91506
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x93D3B5054C67B5AC1DD7CCEB5157786D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x3A3FE9859BEB2084A9560F79C7F66E81
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x34BBBD514839E38E1092E451E892B4B9
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x14B469C708170256679811A564456237
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x088FE40C06036B3355CC5051519FC075
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0xF316A7631BC3EB543E6AD39483DA0DBC
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0xB21DE21F262700415A9C9606FE1180BB
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x757F8EFB40F3CC2835D895749BB3AD0D
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0xCFED5E9FB0826A9605F1F3685579A85A
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0xE14F35DE6C254FA0E282A4DE6403938B
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0x2A65B01001FD736CE8BB953E31E06DF2
from you!"
0x28FF04AA888D121B837CD196D49D4A0E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0xDC6A261327BCB52A652B643163262FDD
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0xA938567097BA86C29E7178812DF2A592
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0xEE0631B8DA62EFDB47EAED8EC2E4285C
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x64FF2B2238C72926A43397849EA767A9
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x21BB9C5AF4468207084AA86F41216E8D
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x81DFF35796ACB1850FE0213003524C42
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xF17929CB75E0E9D8DC9F3D92751B45CE
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0xD844829EC0A04351DA14DC0DEABA1654
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x00651F507CB2D94B22F4A8FB5C99D045
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x8A0D0CB015841716D0877D3C0B6B2E5D
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xF8BF8C3BF1DF6ACFCAF0161352F3514A
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0xF4763D32AF9763894251E6788D554E81
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0xD27DA59BEF1B77416782380DFB0E73D5
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x98F0BC7E470D861C1B9E8FE348A7980D
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0x03B68D26E72ABA33AE7AF8AEBE6A5046
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x8924DA5B1F005BDEBFC3DEEA7FFCA292

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x3EA68177C8E419DA210E27873FB6CDF5
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x53EF84AFD19F86F45BBAEEF9DE234B1C
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0xFB6D8A55C3A28631E7E19FCD0B9B889D
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x1ED849624F952D5AA1CEE720B3CC9A9A
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x4837D38E765153F1C064DB36F2C0B90C
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0x1A9B3EA8F328CA3754C4BC0A9BBDA84B
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0xB8C2B16C472570AE21FB048B44A967F7
dim room was full of visions.
0xC97AEC0D22785E2A38DE02FE94394662

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x10B53F98DAA8D6DD7177A3D8047CCFDA
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x19A8255556AE13758B518F23FFA5B525
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x2AD0214CCA010798E0C7FD2A7DBF151C
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0x5FFE372743143FC0C9E491916ED63FC5
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0xA7C753395B73A9E711B68B1443C750FA
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0x6456D607FD84D85687372E709DAFCD94
prayer: it was only elevated.
0xF57EE1259BA587B39426E71C21282298

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xAFC14E3EC43A48C7C44E9CBD23482925
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x45F88138C620FEAE578CC0566E81464F
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0x7EF684A8F8F79674094F660F8014D5CB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0xFD1637CFCB0C6B7C751915EB7949A922
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0xCECC9D46A7BA0A7FE25B5D5F2F1645DB
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x37CCB8DB79E20A446E284F8513C44C4F
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x6DAECAAEC77867DA199974C5B60D3AB7
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x4B68FCBCDFC873E3156D98C75CB0E56C
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x3314EC398B56C2BFF052DD5A6C305A66
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0xC9E48CABD695B27EEBE440428D5930CC
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x588EB50D8A39442EEAE88784DF81F3B4
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x5DE810F9E5B1B1778A7F8C57A164B7F3
shall judge.
0x5F4EAC02C54573F2B5A02F70309DCA5F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x8C8679E1C152E71DB86B1CC3CAC0F957
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0xE00FE6BF722CB2009949667D8ACCA06D
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0x9A5C8A371A0EABB57D11801F7176648F
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x503D3896B809B587CDCACF010AF0EC01
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x16BF55F2454E02D273FD71115FE39E64
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0xAABD051EFFEAD4DBF016DDFF8FF064CD
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x4DBC333AF6960BD412B131353206B66D
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x77BCAB6D73990CE87E64D4A6ADCC333F
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0xC9DD2669CA18ADE142A7406CEBA961DD
bones.
0x2B674E4222855ECA21D67EF93D8A09BD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0xF89F156E4CD34B9BCD4C7499F963AD7D
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x9CC49579684A488B7EB4461B848DDE4C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x7827B63BBF182423ED22AC475B8742A0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0x5D31CBA12B606ED6C07DCF51B4DFB9A9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x076509CA67ABB68605994088C052CECD
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0xCB98444AAD5EAD442928551FD940B85C
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0xB1FBD7C138978ED5E514D47DE08254CC
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0x7485361DDCF39E2C485E9AE3CF9E785B
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x6FDBF9144C515A4BA10A74C80D4CDB53
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0xE3C837471E1D392BEE65982D4664CAEB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x03F1038D70E9733E25500EE675D9A7F1
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x5B5CED32AEF497FBC9019003159F8B95
garden: it was void.
0xC27F79717E8B2133076008638BFA4989

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x3BBE4D00C827284D73A18716488C3C58

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0xBD3BF4A6DFCE5B5221AF746AF744280B
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x0C29A0D4361FA2178D6EB9700790D68A
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x3C459A13D6541880DD1C27CF0DF1357A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x68B9CE3CFAB3579184959DA113EC0014
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xE06FD55805742425E61A091154118234
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x2D8AFFEE75932C26D5B612807C05C5D8
best."
0x010DF4E1B93282FAC4E65834E4B8EB92

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xA13BD83BBF23CC91A9FA3F50C5E2EF2F
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xE0699B4108B0ED261AFEF80F61C5B865
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0xDEBCCD10A61BF570F614389666E65D9C
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x3B3AB9BF3164868C45898FDE826ADAAD
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x256BF31FA77FB7B7FBE4817A4E466AB3
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0x031430D24221EBAB303BF5BFB18A2840
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0xC46FC0CBC500705606231ACD2FA636DF
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x75D02B4364C216F000C15B8F42BEFD2A
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x0B54E0BDCB33F1DAC8E2D353DD393DDE
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
0xBC7BFB89CA092079C65FA9B191F05786

CHAPTER XXXVI
0xD708036BD484B50CF6CB9F299ED4121E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xF35650C5DF92EBA9FBD1FEB40FD3F61A
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x5FD71EB857296A13A5276E00B6A39A2C
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0xF33EAEFAB55E9DA74039977A5ADFDA39
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0xB9EB59984BC84FC1A7BDDEA57B172FB0
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0x73F666DC45B7FF0FE00A6FA991983C7E
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x506D3834F867C7390B1CD5B8469351A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x1498B4D66C8071FBDF8B81BAB49339F4
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xD326D2F3630DDB947FEF238D4F210A19
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x6D80020EC4EDC9B48409B55CDB968D1B
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x3BBD55C0BC142896929D8EC0EF7CE24E
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0xAAF8864665670F54E7149ED01205159B
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0xED987B55EF8EA7E815CE3BADE45C2E9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x1BABD3B82DCC6844AD1F6237620F458D
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x4E5CBAC2FA447409250700781319025D
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0x2792CE7A19E9E3E9237317B7B37C43F3
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x54FD6DED6DB130DC83BDD50C0734B330
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0x2F98209AC38BDF725CA1D48D524209E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xBCDE326FF7D2AD85F0452BE8AB07DD5E
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x62A2D4AA01C4F8772D909E7AB9F5E385
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x40EC590E481DDB991CB4A2CE7E535414
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x91350D67BFB0E7D173D9C61848F163AA
would meet the coach.
0xBD1A9A36D63E602346A8FCBD46D171AE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0xBC2563BF8F0957265621683D95798A2B
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xD52C3174A893EFA79F18D3BCBD54350E
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0x05663A344C162D8397A420FEFEF0ADE0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0xF5ED78E94C27E49E9BA13DEC1A4018A9
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x376A6DB6EEBFE2F5033344C92CD2975B
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x80118E47A2C13F39E5A476034702BA56
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0xAFA0C596A979A248F1D7A81A4E3E9E10
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x5DC29A50A5BBECBFDC52D5719DF811F1
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0xB35582760D508DD62592EE3DEADC9067
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x7888975125E00829F46194B4B2F647AD
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x5B722072047E1AA693CF52229BEC10D6
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xEAF05FCC074702086377D5075A5D975C
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0xC904526ACF265AE8FDF4A11467BC05CB
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0xE378F02356FAAC931625A992B53C7A28
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x90BD1B54748047A4976AAAFE8F827200
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x70B3D89A007BA48207CC982AF9C2587C
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x00C6644A1AAC2D29A613B6AF7A6CBBAB
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x1C3702708D866549C39FA4EC106ECA76
body.
0xF719A41164A1A0069ADDC18E2893F5C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0xFBF9FCB3281B9C2A81EBD3E62A852D25
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x33FAB652A0830E29ED76A3A7E2887054
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0xC9466789D1826A6CA5C01D68D369F77F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x2560D0B2EC44ABEFE39D312368CA1682
and should be absent at least four days.
0xF49C6EC09E4602A2102C8A8B9F584681

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0xC509AFBA42A74DDDD5D3EDA3D7FD7E89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x56F7200059EF280C9243D74AF19F8A74
time been uneasy."
0x0DC51F1B32C3BB63B4100791015EAAD1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0xC48EF02ACEB63E213D801CEF7E1E5391
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0xF7D501BC23B3ED05E69AF6A6B8573557
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x5D262AAFEED8D4566E447BC5E19B9A3B
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xCDD8AAFA20E8DC1CC84F3B56AE19E060
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0xC117F4F6E77BCCD5222FA106AB28CD3A
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x7AECECF5837FA4145302A2AE057F937E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x1DCD1F159CE18AA58FBCF6E9E3AC0568
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x4116190483D6EB59DF7587050848D30B
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x02495C418795F26F1B0560CC2E0AB9F4
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0xE1B4DE1902C29FF76A272137309344E5
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0xFA7BBEDF4C5917F386BFF20AE64EE9F8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x86132529B02B553F609C99F1D8F12E59
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x87BF6AD2E7D4688BECE7B2A2B5ED712A
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x246A4B628AD56BF0A1E8E0EC1CB6F058
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x86FFCD9158E1E5D4F3C37957BB10576E
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0x5046DD531DCA00EDD5DEC83CF7865204
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x40C004874FA946AC5A9DAD7E4B4BA2A0
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x7124C9EEFB1EC4BE5357BD0E2C7A15C3
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x133B8F4E629B71A8203FE31424831272
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x63BB5C7E4172A5FE2EACB337E30FADFF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xB3FE3760EDEEFF7B34428E3C14D8032E
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x7F44EEED12E2EDA7216535D5440E1EC4
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x323C80FB2838C78620950599608354E0
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x329E4BCAD07D6BB8E55230F13A4B9502
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0x9E20700AE886E70E3BDFE660A598A4D5
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x61583D82707312E8E4D25DE0ECA9B85C
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x7BF5FE93A0FF6E3BC4D31C348BFC1894
we were near my bourne.
0x62D5F0705A8D59B3BAB7247969247D47

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0x3AE548285C937ABF112A58E93F4D6D9C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x5C610416202DE8214493B7DF588B61BF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0xD07EFE2E7D9DF68C8870306FA4ADF34A
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x10FEA046EAC58A92D3B9C35086D5B123
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xC261986D85B04F81EC4A3112F3F62A34
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0xC11433FD1A37ED7CFD5D306BD3B36852
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0xA7D57B4561707B71C99394CAA29E2675
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0xE3FFA547CC2E39C2C61C858A889AF7E1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x7C9FAC409D3AA6DB3DB26C46C34DF2B4
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xEF786D02CE55C71F3D8028A18B7CE18F
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0x52FF693F0807877CBF017F1663881D13
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0xAEE9A2A209D5E33F5697D2412766A622
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0xC3F9792582D37D3909D7FD49419750F2
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xAAE3B1408CE02B1AA1580EDA39505D7E
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0xBDF45F4A372B64193A6076E421C7F8DC
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0xE368309DF86FDD44DE592E655C82E8B7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x2E5EDC89AD0DB8EF912D7F30A8C5D8E0
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0x5DA6B69C93E394177F9F055AB7B7DB15
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x89645CA8A921C84192525D4D2088125C
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0x2AC99298D8B9FA518038F21170495131
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x25C3B20F269A51E800535DD644F38DD6
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0x9D0ECC9A9E6AFBFA1099FEC859AC3E26
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0xC9E30B0566C30630F94B43C39F05A78C
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0xB3C84A59E821E2CE6FDB105AA8F39CA0
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x7401BE140BD99218ED7364698DD71C1E
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0xD7F3D17951215D02D960A14C986D87BE
them!
0x377A35350C8FD98F9A699CD37C785CBC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0x4A82EB1DB0180B8A48F1AC1ACCF7A62C
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0xCA96FEA635CFCBEB7EB2A36378D0C407
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x1685444944034E920D244EEE92B118D5
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0xCBC9FDB02799CA3CC75B2AC33FA37196
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0xFCCD6F464859D9D441EA7279A85966FF
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x0A634F275223780C5AEC07932A8DCCDE
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0xA16CD49A5F2BD5C576888074DF7774E0
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x60D35F873941F9D582BE245AC974DF89
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0xE2007160D75168CC5FD47A6076160F4D
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0xDCA51BDD0A7784D91AC824CF0CEE46CF
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0xC305C65D37C25E59F90F93DE7C2818CA
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0x29BE34A265A9651C1E4C2873A6FCD7DB
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0xE5B0AF3B79FBF17185B919D00532A8DB
tideless sea of the south."
0x66A93F4E16ECCC1BC4AF5B8F2385EBC7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x6D7D666A98C60424902D31BAFABAF496
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0xCF887EF35266D2372EDF34ED4003DDC7
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0xF6B678D9541E9CDDE6DF1CE536A0E7E1
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x685D650CD7CF05ED33FA0EF32D1F2E61
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x09D30BF5D0142C6B246DC1707F3224A7
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x2C18D01C2B782F6326726A3D7D5EAE46
station were at my command.
0xF9E12A352519B2ADCBF166F238090481

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0x114DFBBF9F3EBF8EC20EDE663E21ACDF
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0xDDEA2BB8393754D062E4D09969518811
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x8D2F7A73D8CCF9AF43EC7856E26DA927
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x24DF54886BCC8DCC62EEBF82865FDB08
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x84A75D9FEB3A06AAE7B2127772741405
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0x0667FED0FB500174A6516FAEB8E7899F
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x2E05850FA0837EB8FAE0504A59702BE4
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x6DB88952505C801B8630B26BE8BCBB36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Hear an illustration, reader.
0xE09775528BAA1447F5A7023D9C3B0E9F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0xBDFF75F4D990001CD3E1CF6938E081DD
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xB652302F359A8258425F2B010CF1AF81
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x2577FDAD0694CDE105257E6DE6E31B27
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0x9B57AE858B067B6BB757B0FCD5EC0EFC
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x58250CD4A70D9A71DF9898F1127E88DF
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x006D8718E3C0712C9CA7559CB2449F3B
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0xFAB7BCD4FCF1D5E1264E565D4D619FD1
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0xA44EE0577EA776389463E4D034521ABC
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x614648D2468359F6047FB6F27E1E7881
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0xB23B6AD61A6AC3119CD9893A7E069996
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0xB0CB7A11073F0D85C57A9A6529797605
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0xC908B8687258461A72BF1C2603C46802
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x2B3BE34EEA99CD8AB67EE448B87970FB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0x298DEBE40BAFA5F85095624C1851997D
ruin.
0xA92AC49EABED959F462FABB978DAFC8D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x3100623242808CF38D568E0E740C7D3C
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0xED651EE194C0B350AFE7E68C3227FD3A
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x5DE56169418C405F35D91C013CB237CC
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0xFA2F7F37DB8D35364C98BB5D3F31BB1B
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0xD5D970D551E265C24E0F4EED6377D989
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0xF0FAEC5FC66CF81F173BB50DC34289CA
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x4850ED2AD875960A638ADB11E1E4C93C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x3DFF14F8E1FA4ED6DCC6A6B01747CF1C
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x23AF1516A0391ADB0D012B344718F000
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0x6B3ECFB53535AC4583963EBDC3F88E9A
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x0B4A80386B92CC59A4A152EBECAE7264
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xB0F5EAB5D02BE01485B8F9E0DBBC7F69
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0xED4713BCA272283ABE074D1652962C6F
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x0DF22B5A4EF5CDD81E3DCA81F07BA2C3
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x1456CDC4B47A9F3F0725DD471CE4FB40
token.
0x8B2A9DFFB0E5776FE06E22CC89EAEA34

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x845A0737134AC8A6106BAB89736133BD
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x8ADF70F8600A55C14365F37C0B795549
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x8EEBC746B746AD116D42027CF8219987
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0xD0484639F4156B8D321F257FF42A05A2
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x4ADC06737D2C9DFD2D3138958F060DEB
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0xDAB8B5F6619548DED5CA8A257199E3AB
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x6FD24DAF785BA1149A13AA1E3C311470
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0x6ACA9976BC71F2F4F4A08B5CE5C1C822
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x5FDAD7EC817E99A355951F97F9746392
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x4930C7AA87D87CB1429772096D53059F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x59C107A04E99B6455F61722F67C0E1F4
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0xF1DA810995239B92BA7DE2B068690C58
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xCE312E9D08164BE763585BC3661316F6
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0x2B5D919689570A1312F4E611F0533932
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0xCE70C1B831EEEC146A4A300A2CE6715A
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x82AB21C596DB57EFAA46D46719ECBDC1
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x24711A211B180EC4C98E699A900153B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x37006E3C4DCDE38D34B7922C0C89B65F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0x31654964408D7E0859BD09F65D59B29B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x585C748331034A89B084818E22399FF5
trying to evade.
0x3A9FF5D761B02ECA7BCDE16BEAFA5422

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xEBBD18968CC8A4B509CA7238910F8862
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x54346FDE05E0434B613D5E0170657AB4
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xABC6E05FC98E874F64097CFF73947265
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x5311C888C489FBE61AF6C8ABA842887E
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0xA4D26151B2E8DD225B89A4E02265C0FE
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0xD7CB7462BFEAD50DFDCB680DC395B7A3
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x63B20426CDACF552213D90C5AA1B1703
Antipodes.
0x2C5C46FDF3365A0458E36255390D9E01

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x6629B554DB3E5626463B8EC85D47F57E
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x2A0E98665BBF108367EC9DD6074B41EA
direct question as to where he really was.
0x2C702E172C35B55D895F22869FF7301A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x44BD877ED361E66827803E0932951683
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x927F0452F5956A4FF42600F698056B08
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x58137070B86CA9AAB417FCD7C042F18E
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xF3F3416CC892A173D9E5BBDA8BA7A74D
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xEA737001A5A53BCAE4FECF8003534FBB
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x625CB57D184DB4EF00E48D09D52C1928
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x4B67EA30D1ABF3CE0C96C3B493E504B8
witnessed it myself."
0xA9E5299D072BC43D7CA3B87D7371FD8A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0x1AAE097A251286234943AC78D7FA61BE
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0xF35A3F6DB24DA649D2F0AA2CBD8A64EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0xB03FCFC15BF90F30DAAB20253EB9D28E
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0x9B79081499FA184D25020A30FC048970
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0xAC223D66F142E9F1B81073D0B8CE01CF
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xD4163C1F5A6120ACDAC676292A580FC8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I have heard something of it."
0x7F5D881BB9829F1D4D1E2BB657B9F864

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0xC953054D3836747EA6198B58FEA4F689
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0xD3865A4741ECFC6CD05FE57DA9FA110D
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x3C559790C44E660945BA0490753A36E5
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x33196828766C5415C2F4F9894B8B71C4
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xC56B7E4C07D1EBEF5B0EED31D023D7A9
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0x5E3704D18AEC87652D484F3A650F5EEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x598207E659579C6635A7B0B2F8F93149
main fact.
0xD712A273B7224701BD71360B5061EBCE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And this lady?"
0x29946020577C9B0E618E7B465F4C7F23

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xCF56A9B21BE2433821C5092526B4E3CB
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0x435B10A24B55C3D5F44A2715F06411FD
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0xD7A069EC6BAFF28072E9BA44AC8CBD5F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x694776D409E36B09B5FA7D6A52828F5B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0xB0E5166A20D56ED584B71C79CC6B759A
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0xDFDC6BA57BE9A38859174D2513B41DBA
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x07F09F4EEA5EE001AA5AF00DF03F76F7
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0xC46BCFFD05CBBF88E3733E5EA3F8E7FE
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x008FA54B9B728A481E65EA971F9C20E1
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0x162BA13BA87344C6501A432C66A73C4B
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x92934C87C990923FC1AB458BA10CC387
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0xB9A919BA5A840BA907159A8219FACD83
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xC3EC0A77D03F6554134099D0A8718DCC
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0xA01AE70FA97B1D719E152D67AC0B2B05

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0x29A208AD6994EB401D7879AA3D366BCA
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x13939D4CF237F6B2A37D5FF95150B3C1
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0x48B6B900BF3DBEB3B85851AD8767F64A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x0D78A355D0055B3CCFCC8A049D109367
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x14CEE587A2FDF124829AF93EA0C2740A
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xAF7B18A6708392CF137B03FC4CAE901E
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x99F9C982ACFC2B604D1772B4D8F35313
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0xF9284D312A57F913E06C182EFE050923
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x916CD651BFF6620CA76312E383F28E4A
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x09D88DAC801CC5E118401FB908A9A528
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0xEFE9CA9A5F214D1A9A44616A0A7BD415
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0xCC6175868B6F79376B73305A19B3ECA3
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0x771167B584212155F8860962685FF192
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xE46982655B99793CB0952A1F99943DE5
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0x99E1D2A9527A1D62530C11E11253E84B
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x0A4FDC96C98D6DE8B23C369D1D1D2358
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x3B11459CDF379A902A5CEE246D5290DB
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0xF1253F4DB64320885B55D917575CB01F
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0x8A21DC12E660E1055C2BC6B6B1463F93
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x51BD9B9B8EFA34F53116EB5592DC3D3F
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x69B24F2A1C91B125706F2FDE09EED1DB
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x84C889684A60D728DD5027EC7A33F623
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0xD76A9B0DFE9E81288B30B3217589076B
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0xBEE5AFB1453DEA67E1129AEEE314D79E
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0xB0D2513D6177BC06780A11BA498DB08F
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x382255AB4C7B7DAF34A0F858CAB1D290
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0xE26F6F76BA4179127FBF636F9B8163C4
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0x0D1455EA02E21726EF36C91112278E87
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xF143444CF6B14A51643BBE155051794D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x7D5DE85444FABAC59742570C80CAC875

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0xC25C001EFBB345891D83717976849A90
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0x3ABC632B776A97DC5A46A82A983414EE
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0x51200CD94FF347BD1225C59B07B5B1B4
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0xA634BD59DEC4BDAD878FBB9EC3736081
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0xFCB33073EFB0A378FF53CBF98F6CD568
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x0C7AE7FB85EC286242D88B6A23AEDAB1
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x20208BDB66CAE4D4E7D279B4D5BDDD8A
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x8F61D497C9649B9F1BD4C0FE48665176
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xED9F48ED2988EE06BD85DFDF869E5F7C
Thornfield Hall."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0x7F784B033E1B06F0500861B596B36D22

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x231DB4DFC7CE8866D80A2B58B74C13B1
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x81829548C2BCCB6583DB21593C63F478
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0xBD04623835C4A87E22474FFC9D539F53
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0xDA81099650F855B14502A033345EC785
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x576FB3EA877561D4AFD578A599F26E43
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0xE87A6F1F0053D00FB375B7BD44003AC5
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x40FA8E879B92C6A9DD7AEB9A9968E428
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0xA49F5E367C93E18857CAD4E5A549C502
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x857A9450B19F424D9A9E67EAF7122D11
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x28BE1B5821D0570BD1074564318DFB24
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x40059C07D04B3D8F6E3C398D8BDCEBCD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x8EEED390E2E37352F4406CF17DC31BDF
ask what had caused this calamity.

"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x61C220930B8DD073518565E17164CB5D
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x403107EDC990012FAAC43DCBA347A804
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x1195AD0DC85080EF627C1BA5B052443E
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x4BFFFF5475433B20D8132BA6A5D27E1E
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0xE9BF700C2B78E4EAA7A3E532E6FC7B4D
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x5A40C578376E0ADA2A259D08628AA4FB
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x758BC6E481D26E8BA6AE81E414B1BDDC
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
0xA15E5F1AAC2CFDCB6C2EB39179E0B490
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."

CHAPTER XXXVII
0x0AA9E860F60F95AC95F18A16E2989034

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x918225D3E5939DD7B91F4B99161794DC
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0xAD3CD96507A261107A485DB2B6ED9B05
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0xF8FFABA9D4CE798A9CBAA60B2858B633
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x98B06DE07D61F83CF8EAAC41803ED4B7
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x4C48706146854F7D5FF3605D2AF2C56E
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0xB729BA20A0ADB7CC4967ADE4EFC04103
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0xCA5B4EE22D30FAE28652DE0ADAE99360
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0xF4B4AB6E30C944609B4F687478724002
there in the season to shoot.
0xE8E50AE31CD24E0CA2AED69AAA60568B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0xF9D4026CC8D871A4795BB165D780B848
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x54395F53EF39CA8C91077C780220F763
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x832CF68468B9D8A8441BF80520583317
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x41BE4F87DEE5131D2B417ACE7147E751
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xB84B3651DF0B0BAAE91DF20DC6B9158C
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x6256BBFF98011B1C7B8723D5BA149415
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0xE6007E1003654425FAA36A0663B9B556
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xC31538C64D181213D2A2361B2737FF19
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0xE13BF67F3C448618C63BDA0D53F4FDB7
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x86461A58026FCC2FD2CC59B96DBC46F6
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0x776AF311D5F5C06F27C50754BFBA1739
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0xF7F966B080F88A056449C193CABD6041

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x595D1C04032D3E5E155770D67CB216BD
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x11594B68BA1000AEA256481E400D4D6B
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x09713FB80E2282431B440D07A4EE19B6
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x6397D20765A0A90309863211701261C6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x84DDBB25F237E4254E0B7F639FD0BFCB
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xAD210953E2325A45D8779E8326CB5FD5
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x5281D34BFC098EA4196C4D3B2EEC2FB4
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x1B42E10D119FEA25A1A73CDDBEAAA1BE
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x123F939C0BA360F3625C4354F69F3DA9
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0x7A28C7484AE79472A86F627C43C46B18
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x21D06623C366CE4A4A0675B5F935F469
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x8070ABCE984FD106B2DCFC7FF7A79CDF
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xE2903C06E4F37D77370A25EA9D2B877B
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0xA3998618EA40B08E91CC1C3DE2DF4DBE
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xF1ADD3511F2BE3913A702D76AF88A041
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xC02FEDE791F0BD94B4ECD44E417CEB83

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xF4A795BC426D07C93AB74F6D84BD4860

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0xD5303D726E24277514A65E218EB2E223
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0x03E7E977C4C0049F7EE8F2773FDC1548
grange.
0xB2AA37560AFE224B47AD596B35E845C7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0x25D5F67CFD241C8AE71D9FC841C6E42D
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x26176374D87B5C7D54146E50C7F06E88
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x7576A490B4E644A54CE06B655A1180F8
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x50DE80A4B53E1867ABF2C9B9E93D09B8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0xDF53691974A773460DAFA9B13352DCC8
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x3804EAC78523E359E96518B9F2D35D61
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x7FE6F883E15723E8836532B79977D175
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0xDC9DF88F5676266FEFCFB81CFD8E4C17
advance.
0x41220D0AF37C449F8F8365516468CA65

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0x1200386EF345616881FFB5FA9B9038A0
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0x39305D4A132CBC51E772D4CA9BE5B502
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xA43AC3788AA34F654AEF7A150827FA7C
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0xD944CEB6C601C86DBEE7663E2544B067
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0xAA7EA75BE94ED5A4BB5BB09E4327792A
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0xFB89AB8521C307D48D4BF011054EB0EB
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x3F7ABB6FDDFE286F4BDADCECC5738F9A
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x2430CB31CB9037BFC73AB3097B032981

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0xB12A0A76DD15B2CC198217F6EE95C7A4
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x89AD176FF1DC2F21C17DC6EBC0D7CB41
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x102112FD9DE02896BCB2CDAE2EA7BE3E
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0xBB5546AD7802FE7CFBE37743F96680FE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xCD8E31B25C4921B66DE865F88FA6018B
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0xA971FDBE51C2D4B619D15246CC865073
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0xCFB3A63C8064FB1FFB4F957A933907B0
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xC0ED22016D9D4420EB9C54589A9876E0
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0xB46211DBE21153ADE80294C931DF364C
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0xD9CA2C18C62D9B651317AA66839FF862
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x24013B839E17584C8B9A9E2D0A1E2122
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x316A76010431D11B6FAF819202189AED
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x1979FB5EB8723691695616D36FE1BD1F
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xF242E04980C8E3D1597E4ED9F68AE380
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x88840729BDF70C9778046C73C4780479

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0x5B81D9AC0B1E6C039C5AAF1B490234EB
had you not better go in?"
0xFF8601A78C3C1B1697AC54AF8FC87983

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0xCCEB516D824BFBF98F9003C96BF47D71

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x445F9806FDDD0524050569F7D9B17FF7
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xE8A80AC7630B89EAD831853750EB7A57
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x3907068C4B466729E44DC21E8548839C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x1181BB38E4D54863C1AA4C8E82C1502F
"how are you?"
0x9C47F26616ADF9A2288059F049993F48

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x25CAEB5B2C733D953F6D1448EB05A4C0
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x12D55B174AD58DEA58CFE4A3CBF562C9
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x3035357B221352326571E202B5558062
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0xF6A93BBBE9F7580A9C4ABB78D8E39FB6
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0xBE8A2B7CAAA226E63F58F03E20C4CC6F
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x168B073CF425522458D35BFE49EC99E1
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x4561EE94AFF72BC17C98BB2B123E7A02
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x1228BFBF3536EA5366FFCC6644584DC4
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x9BFB4D2764E741A8C8162E12E2B60649
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x9A30B26D50C846AAA23719FF36AD9B59
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x09B22F1CE0AE6C25664EF2CAAC9FFFAB
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x37D97FFAC7F8839CD18EA46283D59418

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xD7E9B4BC8DCA52C3CCCA46496EDD18A7
to him, but do not give my name."
0xDD1BEAACF7DD255795F830447DF650A1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0x0BA10522C30D51BB07E12EACB265D361

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0xF7E679B68DECBC0E6A2F9B23242CBEE7
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x23A6217DBBEFE923D90090ED5B60CE2D
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0x2421F711D2237FF61F8C4D8088A7E2E7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xD7EEC3847117C3F9A8CF08E715047D20

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0xF8F621231F845729B382D7E99AEDEDD8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0x7F8944CA603B96DE2171302BE26EB415

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0xD57A15400EB555F52E8C3E6E8E838EE1
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0xC0EF292D98A3C7672BAACDBCBF6FF90A
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xD2CB407151D12364C00641310583DBAD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x6486D2CEE0F9C923F2EDAF04E3C0DB75
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x4020082882EB52B10032DE11B2A12290
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x49624E28B43FBA73B8939A74C3729194
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0x0E4C907BD2CE111E143986A0DEBE2310
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0xDE57D8B32930485B4F3A3F3C2598889E
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x7117A03BBB3BC3D2619D3981901D6ED0
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0xA6E9F652DFAAA89FFC45B98B462BECE2
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x88A32F711A905B86765B72454C684FD7
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0xACF157A3326E65B17B8C575BA578F2A1
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0xCB836ED9598F8C2B9C43B2C586F27175

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x4BE35C913A71ED71A44DED056667C0A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0x1BB5BE31525E7839C26E87E06EC63E36
still excited.
0x266EF7106BC4C3E7A1585BF7631E7180

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x07F069646DCD132070FC31CDFE3EEE3F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x8EFACD4D3BFB1B0528D95F9C98837B79
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x2486E780B01A558CED7B10367EA04661
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x6A7EC39EEC781D010C2F5826EEED5825

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0xA447ACBEE74B672DCCF1C4B8F56F907A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0xEB24536DEF303B68356740A24A40E25B
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0x32D09D0C4CE583C9D807E3E2C15723FA
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x5249AA6740ABD1A86EDD580A233E5AF8
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x10A016F7D2DE75650AFD95192D965902
and aloud.
0xF50A3C6BA6E3F01613B1C304FA6FDC0F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0xADB69EF3B40977B643F87D91DF25C3FE
glass," I said.
0xC433C1BC56B6ED9391A7FD5056C710E7

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0x8E245FD3B248CD203BF5D3647C0312A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x5317FBC32C813103D15C592AB8F8D5A6
evening," I answered.
0x5804F1E63C6816E019FB939AA6AE6ED5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0xD808A436A6F31FE20DFF7ADC34DA0687
seized me?"
0xD24C8A8102CC33860DB9859E5B299AC5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x72CEF0608847AF4507EC5BFC4AF5285C
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x4494D86D4C16051F320E1C61F47762EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x9756D0E69FC09241B17A5FC1B94020AE
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x5C75490370BE1E3DBD4DDC6A177B6E02
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x355800B8E81EA22EFBBF15FB033CE867

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0xCB218ADE9A68BB03CF5517125FEC5B10

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x29D49DD97B83B88C0DD0E1A5D1616C84
must be more of her."
0xC579C974EA0AC67629DED62206720AF1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0x1AA0E412E1D854F16E0752DE3A6C0B8F
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x22921DFF78F95AED196FC92B3E649B8B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x6DCDACAA5C3D8C3FBE3E5218A8C9E163

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x8B7CB0B6D8B1C61771BD363B4736A37E
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x88D04ADF668993E2E26FFD9650C287A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0xFE2F842E3B91E6287FD0E0658C81F1F3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xC048214ED3587C2AC67C415EE20848F8
come back to you."
0x16E27B09832F666803588F681EAC159D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0xCBDB7B0654F10594D83E464DC0BC7581

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x53E79BCAA3F91E091D763E72275E5002
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x1F00D3105694ED4FE828F40DC7CC6771

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x2DA3E706DC34DC1CF8B80E99F0FC9AF3
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x5B51ABB0A77F7E96DF106BBE258D6770
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0xF1F12821DDF8503EE17EEC9954A92D5C
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0x21BB009C6410855FD94BBC25A37B49F7
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x5BA547B35472E31909341CB6C9934DEF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x0222F0A9BD1A0E40D86233303017CA4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0xA79189B4B8E85F10460A305EACFE2A35
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x8A0E6165599B29260BC45767150CED5B
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x92A61D947B796A6B2A10E0BD0BA71E71
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xA77997B824E12ECC2027101265CC361D
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x3352AEB5620CF0EAB48BF1C04A0A3F62
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0x6C177A13CD3F52E84CA7D0533D33BA97

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x50E8C86240FC1625D608EB9DE24A980C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x89DAFA21A2D0F0A0F7F112B123603EDB
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0x323C8886851474C7588EB51B24E4DF32
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0xA109E6454B4196326767E5FFF91C388D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
0x935322E4D430A1874864F5B92B42CDD9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
0x848D8A1782B7A94F7F5E4B5EF8704ADF
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0xC3D39538905B3C8EF3BBF16224128F60

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
0xB96F08E8B17224920722515D1A69C201

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
0xF9DF16791122F1C32BFB25693159C608

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
0x823EB08A4DAD8DF7D4BD58D69C9F96FC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
0x608E6EB4E38056C20F541D1A0B0732ED
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0xFD83FA17B27BFEAE02525179EBE1B4E0
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x6CDE171A103CE4295EF6A3EBAD9E2CB4
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0xBCD381D8DA08C65E6DDEB854B6A32DA4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x0784FBB838CD2C22E662354C53A41CA5
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0xA6590089912DE996FCD231ACE5C72F01
company of an evening."
0x4B764424B343A979ED7F53975398AAFA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xA38F8A5DCF6861F71669734A489006FD
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x4AD1DDD8CC8FE45020B38C1AFC71B10D
me?"
0xAC1D2F157969B8C351CA6192B9CB1CF4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x1A623424CF9917394BCDAD59C72D9FAC
mistress."
0xB5A7665E756FEDAC438376DC8B64010A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you will stay with me?"
0x0C9E37302A7679792E5B38646C24F5A2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x0E419A223696C4DDEEE12A7997965283
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0xD3E22A915D5E62D322AA0935E31648A4
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xA04865CEEB98E0EC8F7704BEF1F26D04
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0x4AE073703A8E409A1B2A8305CE738378
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x812F5F6D8167EFCB34A3093D2A3421D8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xF2B8B48F6B3C81C36856452F152DCFBC
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0xD54DA68117FBFFED4D2F1170D1E24BBE
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0x3DE94693B6E2DF04E52073E83939BC9F
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x98755CB2BEA85669D8ACFEEAD4DEB42B
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x8FA2DA6A5863DE6B16FB1CC839C0F328
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0xCF39191995AE017A73F7FBA334A3884C
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x55FAAED9C0B39DE6241BCCF7E1FFE14D
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x6BDAC5D27056B65454E958A099D64815
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x432C4D036227E6277DDD9F3037C76A5B
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0xEE21809B5EC8E0F26DBE5D753FFFAB22
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x3979E840E4EE8D4225996C4703D602EF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x9FF6A988F35D00DA233A1AC55B80D005
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0xB3C58B0B3EDE8BF37D170CE34789364E
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x80B16BD88D634DD2BF37B6886C5AF0E1
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0x4414348775578DC791E9C96FA553F720
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0x7F969CB65AEA06D27A8BBA779239DA92
vengeance on its frame."
0x826B54AE28B1419B4874AC8BC4A08B2C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0xD7F740CE7FD9ABE68914CA17D37EC658

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x954D5883194200EF5F57A122CAACAC57
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x0ECC35AED35648EAB878D81DD618062F
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0x8AEAACFFCB7338EF53238BFEE335465C
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0xB833E469045A59672E323C8ADF33749A
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0xCAD478687A939138751BFDD2E86377A0
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x12228BAEFBBEC4AB8E2FE7A214EC6121
Come--tell me."
0x73EC08145F2AF35A4D34CAAB4ADCA828

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0xFB140B8B992D9AA70FA0D9E07FED4E16
you think it better."
0xDC8C7491AEE7B651BBCD90A9553D50FF

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0x047490F81227271E19AEE4632756C0CC
one day."
0x7BDD0BFC2FB84419330F68ED3F4E3622

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I don't care about being married."
0x40C0F24C3860322BD68C58C6C9CF8DFE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0x69B0CD412AD174717772E0E894142110
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x560DD79296DAD7B8F09530401DCCE783

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0xD69B2E8044159D6FB0EA44F2E3ED661F
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x0126B422BCAAE26638B9E22CEC4B0582
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x623585880E95BA30B73B704F7C78D711
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x35BD6A4A24415402B375EF1ADF3EA39C
conversation.
0x76C1640AFC06724F1EF3A75FB3B7A181

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xD2B8BFE22A34C42656A2A5C1161DDFDA
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0xC083CBFFD1D895BC1E49EF97B5A86F6C
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x8FA0AB682667E689B47A75C7E60DC4A9
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0x7C235877A92BF4A1114C600BBD1E63BC
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0xB2D2ED6997EDFB612B7D1ED01DB43BE3
not yet noticed."
0x82E390924761BA300E0327C9009DAF80

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the

mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0x8C419C6ADA68FC33489AFD64A9F011A9
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x48C2C47F94A750F6CE9CB9B264937718

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x46D4A3CBB41CA67FEAB1C93BF5CCC4C4
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x2280C7F3A989A60658DF2747690B57F8
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0x302435E1D6FD654281D75BE2805BBF5E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

cicatrised visage."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x842EC27D135B6EBA8303062AC29D7AB2
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x0D0E65B63AA8EE7F0BB02CF66B57F86D
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xAEA5CD6F706CCC8C4D311FF4E772D5EB

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x97444D295C92B6C37C3799E64246ED36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And you see the candles?"
0xD9B1A952E14E60E41B35BF7527F1D22C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"When do you take supper?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I never take supper."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xED2C9B1D6E0ED2F90DBCB59ABF70135D
only you forget."
0x5CF5F034B0F032122D1627A66B6050D2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x135C32AF891C7BBED05BFD4B08149A3C
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0xEF5523FD1570320D30EAD0718CB08701
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x9608C75D8557288D6362E9AB720A520C
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xCF592E989A9B0480723E9E0512BE7118
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xB6442D0E8D67556967CBB828BB721AC6
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0xB904E3C3135E459DD6C5B1564E9D9847
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0x74615F39C50043BB5C2AED012738707E
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x5AAE87623AA5ABC95511AAC03209DEA8
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xD9BCBF2DDEE01F932D11788FC1F5DD5B
lineaments softened and warmed.
0x0206F287853D1F5F0758A88C0047BD7B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0xF2799B0E24267261A3DFD9AA35E14F22
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x1485ADAE627E36A02194C8D7A6151FBD
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0x9808549300699A23028854676E7F9A77
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0xB4299BF252AD3F3AA5CC91D71564EEBA
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0x847CB661169797B1AEF8268B1D4DFE59
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0x173D99560979CBB9D44B939F9DB2D16A
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
0x77CE3B38E1E07D2C49BCC2ABD8A38333

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x06FB3FC77E5DECD9303EFAE3B1B9983A
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x3E81B602A6E0DAFC1702643D56670901
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0xA197AABAAEBC16CAA5AC1351F6719DD4
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
0x3CCF051A66147AA8109E1C1D0E2547A3

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0xDD6CF2B5015C2A7A9EBF9C5AD748F852
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x5345A73826EDDA26B8387B7844397771
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xCBB9E23396181DA02D59FC7E92D65D0E
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0x5E1972E4A9D47941F03DDFC7740DF7C7
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0xD7E8DE7BF1F27E844DC1D1FA5189D391
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0xB19A670F7A9095B12B0ABDD140988DA8
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x9E3AEB252B7CC8B31FC0B5C3663B1864
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
0xC1BB37DE8F0C3B6E6CF6EFC99E11AEA6

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x76A43FA6A766D62018045E49B7B21CE6
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0xC06B629EBD179A7AD895EF06EFDE20D7
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xD64F3C7FDA7F6BCE4E01C9DD3A38E150
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0xE288FA959EC5BB07293DD5AF6A101910
them grow as broad and black as ever.

better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your

0x5DF71F37E5DE8962E9B28A0474245E36
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of

security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0x2A04D9A7FF99908512432DCABA8C84E5
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0x569FABC8BFD69BC4035C3597DFDAC9B5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x6C4C2381F8BBAF942EA6E0C3443EE642
been?"
0x2C08D29BF21CD2AE7C37060B9B692630

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0xAC0EF47FE48C053602A0CCEAF6E15CCC
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x06755009C297E4420AF42E446DF5D581
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x7FF802CBFF3BDC5CEB9AA9DB1BDF6F4D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0x49EA946008E5379073B2F82D5157B227
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0xB202879163EBAB7EA5543F338FF0A87F
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xAA2959325D094EA66D0B8D2E18C0E891
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x301445872B5F73C5EC8E43A195E1E90C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x25B1286DDD4ABFE878CF7071AC4FE50B
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0xECC1A8E751557C6EB6B73B3A313DE3DC
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0xE1A7C1C1A99F647728C08062A7B4D7CF
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x6F9C98B4D333E91CD19204112D62E694
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x72B92C6B1A1651344F45B05655046E92
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x6D07BA3DAEB7A7818773755C7C071E41
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x902092FE600B4D44DAD8D2D5B26CF114
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0xFDCFED522770C8614F79FC51EB8549A3
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0xDF55F80DB31FB627CDDC4269BE4DE0C4
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x4EA66A3683AA3EFDC660204BC8D32C1E
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0xE93A62F92BA23FFDB3419C23839B7E08

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x82321F68760002C55FD0C040C3A3CA2F
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0xBBFEA2BE714727FB5688FEC3E2CE2564
soon."
0xFE56ECE085D5E0454E981E5C694C5AAC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x124FAB772F365F4CE242C294F12C2B84

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x76F84E7AC721CACBC58420753834C663
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0x193977813549B74A5E192912B6EC48D0
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x1DC0F26DD82A2BEE52AC7DB976EFCF17
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0x0249CD312FB21BDAA4A83A243504DCD3
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x0E157A216C6157BDCCDA3D219DBC7D9F
can feel is in her presence."
0x9F0B560DB049B3FC2E917080F509EEF1

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x1E772B610F32FFDCF94449BD6E55EF18
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0xD27DCEB69CF24E4D8FB575763545791F
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0xF1AD159C68982AE4C59CDB9116D61E6F
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0xC23202DEAD835FA518433563C1CB8B42

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0xEB9578D9753C0EDAE76719B7AF64DD6E
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x4BDD0F834658B8D16C11B56A6ACA98D2
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0x2FB27C114193AC92CD554E80AEF3EC99
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x1579145CC98F5B8A71713C5D7D475E51
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0xCB31779328DA88FE6560719C204F8E64
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xE90444ED4E0AE398C0AB8257D2D24B04
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x1464BDCB7122D706DE75CE9EEE3F36C8
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0xC2CF7EC7B5FA6D6C6ABA25B91B314402

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x3252BE60AB8C796CACD56F6FF94DE7CC
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x24DD427A862C688EB1D2072CA5C3AF4B
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x2CE28C0E4FC28579AD290FF1E75A54E2
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x636D4EFD109C5FF17455C03D8901BB7F
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x2B9DC896CD210F099D6335B34BC3CBA9
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x86161CCDE7E5892F0CA2DFF3BE5452E2
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xEA439B72E267AB21861AEF5FE949553A
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xD5A93CA62D2CB0F4A6759AC5702BD43D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0xEDEDD11CB5F7BBD0B6CC1C9AABF62082
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x6C20A3B8927BED7FEA343475A21755CB
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0xDA690D8272DDD0584CF73FE5CD16C4FA
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x31BEC2ECD8A6BCFA5C663494EB18C5CC
deeper than I wished.
0x00FB0A2CAB27695CEA1C2FEF7B4D2C89

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x55809E34B68EF8262076B864F6087128
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0xFB5D3DFB7628A969EA63637F64B20F72
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0x3125A8ECC34BC2A6B2722700112BA44B
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x63740D109C9D7B164ABDBB0CC881926F
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x0452495808ACE6060654CE829A00B1CF
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x6F941629FF3412850F52E7012B54CF23
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0x7BD2E90F0A1A915160EA7E4CEB90FB47
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x9F741F42EADA1EFB84A16755412FE528

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0x5F939FED76A1F4461AA59860088E33AA
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0xBFAEE0F59976B9A19D72F7320F063E1E
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x7AD1AECCC1F2C50B8026AEC3F2D6CCC4
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0xB2A53D4CF46E28455347FEFBD18431C7
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0xD3CD164D83FC251E11B03ECA02387072
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x5167C5179D051180D8F4274D1BC85824
up.
0x9EA4FD28408F5E2E44EEC50967B3B2C4

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0xA778C5188C4E2928D5AA1CA56026748A
Or what does it mean?"
0x912F2C7457ABF0842BEE8B5C59C2EA04

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0xF784102683E9C3D1DA307A6008AFCBCC
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x2CF4FFD8F3FFBCED3D1430738E63AE01
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

perform."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0xB756B11EDC14E391163722F5C52F666C
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

parsonic?"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0x06DA0C4DEA636ADD38362A6EC165F418
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."

"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a

sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x03297D8BA6DE38D1D0D7A8EE7EF9D7A6
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x7C4DF44FB91C87A482DDFB70BE6F55C2

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x10ADD9B621FE1503DF84C710233845F9
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x4C5871E2C193B70E87600FA00FF771DE
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x6EAF2C109681A9D7EE4E4A7314E9A2D3
immediately charm the snake.

"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x892864B7C9A2FC103F89DED0E75467E6
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0xC3CBCE083E9D6F1A63494D21817525D5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0xCA8B032F9E39973CDFF18829CFC6404C
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0x93039767CFBA0E31EEA1D22959E2E672
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0x8EB548E0B444EE6B358C116A64236F3E
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x247DD7543046AAAE85C17CF2F259EA97
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x38BB99C98E9365F866FEC07F3B7C129E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0x218A72A9E32312DEB015CC9BD7890E41
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0xE0A316594990102C81E18F0B43191EE4
question or two."  He paused.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

you are a talented creature!"

"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?

Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."

"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
0x3C46A6CBF5325202F7192C245CA4D57F
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
0xC33408B67DD47F2C018C49A313956A96
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xCCD293CB96A8D3B9F3F0868E2ADCB8FF
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
0xE15A4683237FB9E04D8006742BC854E3
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0xCB5D8DF1DA9F59A5FE1DEC2B03B1968C
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
0xE0D7221C0C83FAA7E752115471AC32D3
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."

"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not

love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x906898BCBBB6990559AC3ECA99CD3102
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x645D856CF15D765817E2482C5EE41058
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0x16B81BC398F1984BCC0502D4D7CF6567
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x04E7F17FF0DCA363C5C338A1B11CF9FC
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x5EDCB2E3F493E2E7EED64D0CCB0FB3D4
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0xABB336B41D2C764577C76D325DE091D0
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x97EB8B34DC60463AE446FE871FE73B27
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xF36BD27597B9EA19DC3E8C9C0D08B889

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0xE0BC3A5EC05986C67196487E84E4CF81
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xEF733E34100481DF2CB0329DF40BC6B9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xC1C3B90A6C67A7F1D337A7173F34E8CA
you and Rivers?"
0xB6675FEBCAB3668E8340094193635D56

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x357DD62F6CC28607F49D93A9F3744C2C
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0xCD503803834B7311B925870A9DE4A850
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0xB713A24B94B953EF002BDF6281D2B075
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0x2728278753A11832D75DBEBA336F09E9
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xABB467649F0C295700C9D5DBD3B1236E
of me from your presence for ever."
0x81B40F14C7752C6270D6073D8762B95C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0xCDD776A7DE6617095818AE0146E3EFC0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x766735F527830F34608E98AF4EA0C1BA

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x381E19FE89FEF07DB94AD861E1FD1CD0
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0xD56AF353C1E6063E697CD6E6C3D8C88A
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0xC9E0ED91CDD65B7E0B1750EE7436BBAB
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0x36CB7C83ED5EAE9FF94CDC6B6492B6EE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xA34BA33FB7234F8A28CCEB30C1D4F15C
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xB185091F8489345EED784A72AB21A95D
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x3A41C1F284108B8E5122CE0D80454F5D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0xFED44DAD4D740F54B4FB2F02C2B4B150
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xC12E9729E6563AB34D5D0A83BFB076F2
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x2D0AAD19B95C4F0C7FFC0654B8DCF024
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0xBC22AE58B83C9BAEC135F93F2B143752
offers them so safe a prop."
0xC112A4D1D3FEAD4A1334EB10EAA27DD5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x46E31BB984E5DDC27BE48009C190DBE9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x74B91B5B08A8648C4E9D43126C34115E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xDC91EA24F725AA0D0743428E5406AD17
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0xEF7F2DACE75C12D5D072B31B741EDB39
helped me.
0x1EA2EF6764815D8DBB21DE4B6EACB830

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.

"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
0xF1340CBD276E76EEE2BDB2B5185A187B
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
0x5AAB66489DA77B90598402C145F7DC18
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
0x8ED3A7199576E8E6AC607B0E100D8EF9
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xC0DF89205CC4EEB442C293B5E1B428D2
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0x866DD488D9A4E3CFFA696D158EC10D5D
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0xFCAB9376B7A05FA8FD950AF9106642D3
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0x3E1D3BA717416726F4B1D7B1C780D544
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0x9029D9B9CDD8FEDE4BA5790C3AE0C87D
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0x75AD953AF3AE231FF4C6EDF1A1646D4B
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
0x327B8DE224221F29BBFF790F49ACDFDE
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x4BD2E1DE47D901F0603C37FFA33F6FAF
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
0xA722CFDBF68978A737F34A28CCBEA91F
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x54CA7AA5626780266C34B3C0D78AF397
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x29EDC27041350B6A6EF907942B7E5CB2
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.

"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
0xE2D593512B528BEAE92E7F8AB89C59DC
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0xD5AE55BA767396FBD84ED2E5C858C792
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
0xE1FAF8A2862EE0FA5D23FFE86C5FE350
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
0xE92DC43F623E669AE3F5B6A441BF2407
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0x2AF2B3AA9F162BFAB3488624F833E377
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
0xD510785215626F9279EC86DA9FC8E67B
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
0xF7BFC7D67D889B7968AA110AAFA9F2ED
rejoining Jane.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
0xB0AA46FD52E72D9082AB54F0A0741C21
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
0xAF22FEE007EEF2B0CBC8299E1B095880
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0x6BE86359237C80D0992365846222557B
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0xA2272D8EDAD0DCD62AA01B1C3F31D60F
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
0x8D1DDA1592AC6EE1301F98F43F24B6F1
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
0x249AF1E83235F92B5441E37AC25E8A01
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
0xC2A1AF6CE82C8DF6C866B55111761113
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
0x616747E5D9EB780A12F450DF0D7D5859
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
0x28BBE379A5DC37F3C846DABC9AFABD19
Jane!  Jane!'"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
0xCD32A10E5BA04FCEEDF58CBFED9D8D4C
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."

"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
0x9F00D083AB606BFB272F9BA6E7B10A1C
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
0x13A74DEE5AFD444831EA933D44E8FCDB
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
0x07B4B8372432EBB30711E60C1259EB43
that I heard what I now relate.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
0xA68B9A71ADC93ED2903BF5BF6C60C37C
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0xF50681F5578C947149CE642622F561E6
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
0x9F8487DDCBF9830E925B3BDEBFE0E548
are you?'
0x4170244BD1E5C627998D5DF1FA58842A

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
0x9108408BA6BFE11AAEA7BB550037070D
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
0xCE58BCA97D42743762CE1C3C38AFA107
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
0xBAC36B6EC6F12ADDD043E18CC884B4F7
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
0xC31948638E840E95304A918419D37AE2
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0x06239A521CA2DC3FC3B2526B1B039030
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x0D9CDEB8F78275C6B079F3EA6F018063
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0x3FC8C13F5256EB44256A89DD8C9E153E
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x452850AEAB852FB8C01C34F3E904922D
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
0x6282E281B249939878E6B0FA8B850A21
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
0x5C23CE7C0CA7896CB5EDA9BEE1397A46

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0xD9C75F6327BDFD15C4080AC003C207D8
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0x2537E37A6D5994C8AADE521FD0A0A677
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xEFB7060B9FF51C99936EF4556B86A562
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0xF8B7484622F6619E9F2084CA96763A56
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xE2BBC0F1E6062BA69530FC802C9DA546
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xC77C92E0B8ECAF37522B66CDA2BE9607
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x9C9F2AFD8011AE4791866E7D2BF226C4
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x6BD41D09F1A4188CFA6ACFC8458447CC
them in my heart.
0x9615202671AA76CA799961A94F34C79D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xC63F0A42790D4F0BFC03AA74F5144A58
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0x5A7130FB2812719492DB635F67DCF435
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x774A9124F928E96C3850CD94F6D5E964
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0x16EC98F8A358DBBD75BC49D5C4484574
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
0x989A514EA0CFC77CD90992B0B41D2164
God!"
0xB8C9E505CB1A573D0CCA5BA484C42AB9

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
0xC41BD5086FA836BBF2507CA9C60E9920
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x6567E317FBFE6F05CF8A18BD768F8CEB
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
0x6112547C03C896B524938E7E2A8D2458

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
0xCD2B17BCCF35D75EA54AF7BD1D5FC4CE
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
0xD9EFF63051B96ABC43B559E930D3C48D
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0x2D75F7E02D3E439AD3382487E036514B
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x9477A4D4C07522861478A361C5E6AEDC
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x90A7AE3CD2925956B6D4602F7E1C9773
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x5B1D373CE1DD7BEF04E411E3456E6F36

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xD6A5DCD4C807C6115098056231096A81
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0x72B06A0CDC9C0246A091A8CEB0DF8B7D
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0xCD920341E38B8DE9D729B28DD2043DF7
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0xEC47839CA5AA76A985EC0F2D8E795E60

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0x2A205ACC1E90868BBBA6D81DF0BFC794
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x94BD329EE718D4AA46A334B5A32BB34E
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x94BE4EAFCE61F72691179AB2B5AE4494
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x873ECFAACB7E04BA84251A4678E574F2
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x6A6FB367364A2926FC1D1F855139B4B0
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x03116DDD7D599B9ACCCD62EABB88532D
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0xFD1B6FAC7B4FCC9C35CA6C9E561469A1
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xDE2769A94B0423B89B67FA87861D50CF
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x9B68A8F3A3D846894B1DC16D1F74F141
again over the roast, said only--
0x7D9C91C30B2844CAEEA3199ECC90E3C5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xC8C9E0FA852D674CC73E163839A11553

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x34CF2F05EB759AAEC5AE5081510D18CB
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0xAB0D73ED8FF0D3F9B31EBF9547E21F3D
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0x8C25A4183881742D3A7F2CE2EB66BCBE

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x9554C405BEE54CFB412423BC5114512C
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x28B4CDDF00EDA0D62FF5E9F2E751D585
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0xA332E7E215355A2672F17D234ABAE60C
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x458110109BD4E3DE61487B91978FEF32
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0xEE2445B35B6C016647ED17907823699A
politely pulled his forelock.
0xF3CC390FF460098322DE2E50A4605835

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x55BA96F6972E22C95E6B462813A17BF1
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0xCA913B232775F1D7352B1D883EF869CF
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0x35E73163A3DB56D89AA105A381A9A69E
caught the words--
0x8A2FAD1F7548DB6FED6C543AC202C6CC

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x529C2DCEF3C18ED0FE2AF7D71F75B45B
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0xB37A2E3195A5E7BB14BAD34C51D35698
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x3F90B84104242B64CC9A26548875EDA5

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0x4EE39585CC19582E1AC28F90D2902804
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0xF08C2DE0F385162412A8DD9827BC7753
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x135D79956C8B69A9FCD8F189077A9331
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xD1C3ED4559D5F80EACA7B472B5B7424B

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xA79EEB9ECA0E8FD4A9CA8975A2D28FE6
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x1694B7741F92F0C283AA8CBAB04ED0B0
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x6412E5C82DEB2C74FCA590C477AD597D
grave or mine."
0xD30379B9B08D2A768442828522FDD216

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0xD563ACBC4B6CF31F13F81CB5040F74FE
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x4509D68CBFE8DA5D5E4956AC59492080
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x626428290399B7DD792B148180D6702A
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xE99756DC137CFFC77F2F09211FC6B907
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0xF2286CBB7AA3B66C7AB759F5BD7B54D3
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0x23101F4177DE4229C6F762A67800CD58
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x8418858422A554FA2DD735A513846F2D

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0xB53AE0DE1CD882C251808778B91C27A3
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x5558E681A72189AA4947D2213A47E0FB
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0x643C4BC5048C97F8A05FE8E37B503E2D
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x244090775DE8D8E055A687811D3B54C6
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0xB13409DA2BACF58682C43F7CEE457DEE
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x786D897064D47BEA053477E4D1AB4131
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x71E8DD9FA8844BE21441A3F6E4BF7593
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0xC4E422861C49EDB0C5941AC1935635CE
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0xB6C46D72831188797035999466CBE62D
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x44F7C061857718F9B7DC23F2195768A1
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x2DF5DC38C332C8454E6ED9CDBDD4EB95
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x22604A48FD9E8E9E1953190799FE479A
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xD64AAF0918778D85CAE5E4E4D4D31566
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0xABAE8B338FE090BA93C06C713F8EF5CE
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x0742F23D5226CB39DC5926252F2279FD
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x9B11C474E2408DF1260CD72B7BD35C89
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0xAE94D4DC2EAA92C9DB5268B22FAC42E1
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x7603831599A1C26B8947ACA78F45D90C
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xDC0DCE6E45347CA91A552D8A27E24E5F
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x5BAF825FFBEC552EE2843CEA4C984990

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x052EFDB9B6DE8E858C8A66DC8EEF9EF5
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0xECA2E2C33BCDF3D1F3951536BA190991
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x978A21762B15ACF14426E32F0AE2A852
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xDCD1159C2949A7294074B6BFA7D70320
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0xC6EE59F9480ADB7B975C2D27EBF7E418
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x539649CE50148D96A5ED3AA53A7B2BFF
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xC6D336F3999D191AEB3E751B242F8234
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xF0FAB8E715FD6D73A0F9FA8F2A01ADA5
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x5B5AE797D5C681B6337B68B9C6E8ACB8
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0xDCF49604EE9DED61E56FF5D932530F7D
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x8154C0DA83ACFE5A1D48B750C3399D8A
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x53D59837B2EC47E1AC5C68BBFC7625AD
concord is the result.
0x7F572E485F8644E4B26D94F53DAE6566

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x80F2E766018E8EF73A31A5D0736C32F2
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x336D5C878AF2B1C1666AA0FE278EE385
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x36CAA32CCDEC4039D0C1E773B4B34C84
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0xB1A79AC551976319C1D0C2C7C36F5F0F
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x19E77A5B95F360E73A4BDBF49DB4B12A
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0x2BD2F060A0E2B226158D06AE533CC9B5
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x9B1FAFAFFFA46763D5F0D4C17B92F812
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x30B645BF7E29FF19B468BE6F0BC285EE
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0x61896171421B133283CCB6663132D1DC
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x332ED47543B8329877F1452F191B8FE6
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xC0EC3B0569A25EDCC4C6CE3BDD3BA483
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0xFE40195A72518B2BB843BE9666EF5EED
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x6B85406A3F8A7F7DF3A2540F66C03598
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x4B192749A1E28AB9A6A8FB56DE9ED7C5
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xD3A653DFFEA1C2007C01B4966F02ECD0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0xB1EBC88AC6E317A71EA2C8893732A435
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0xDD5CFC491DADD7BB132676239A07FFE0
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0x775FEEB929C429DD7368932DCB9FF097

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0xAE9580127C42C7D75A875A7C2BFF5714

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x1CE38E7A12430757616A08BA0B3C463F

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x7BED8B53E52A5FA29F4C6F90F4BB67DD

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0x9D9DF8BA1FF3236F0D99248A40AB047E
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0x3127A1EE31046731E75AF616E598ABB8
sure of it.
0x0448EF6A1A873F6F724142B08FB97033

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x89C47ABCCF0EDEADF2C73F9174D0046F
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x8B26363FB8CF5226F135533D36352640
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x4C922727ACA775DBD8675EEFC02CBDF1
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x8A68786C6E888C47C162C7D5A170C706
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0x6F539DD50E439DF99D60D24D62F9C97D
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0x69818DFDEE413CFCDCB6F92976E981BF
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0x89CEA980D7156E76D8E7566E8AE1122C
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x732E4E1F90AB42CA01E1FC2B63C86A6E

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x4B1BFEAFFE018F26C01DCDAAD0A38C21
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x5453778CC04ACDA8D5D2A28D4E17C8B6
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0xF55A671FCE641EF0E3735BF81FD39433
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x6F2E1C16042DEA25F41E723F2BAD874C
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x2024E0716C9B78697E8B803DFEFDA419
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0xA0DEBA6AACCF0110DDD228BD00D3F010
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0xF60D6EA8CCBCEBA32045CD0F180496E0

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x70C085FDC686B69FBFA68A044C300AE1
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0xEB036547447BC9B2CF5078F892A1DE11
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x75DFF10CBC6AA5A5BD45C50C059D1EC5
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x8C293B85A47AF5E61D0CC4621EBF96C9
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0xA96649E0639973FA5ED7FCCC66E196E0
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x610934F440A8A9AE5B391184BE0EA7B2
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0x013E71737C5C75A500AAD0581BC2DD6C
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x81350E96E6774F119F2243767C00A3CF
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0xA76BA808A52785935D014B85E360768B
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xDBCC32FB145FBAB00B878E93ACB86AB2
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x2E9894335FCA9CFDB18F1AA8552A2187
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x213D9B2767675E0D37E99404679F491F
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x50147FC377B13D9EBBB002597E4D2A37
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xEC8139566F3455EDF66F66A56650C868
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0xE26794C767F3CB8C4D204BDF5DEDFFDE
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x715FCB798FC337A8C9DE98E87D739352
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0xB0ADBB513AF5B0DE28EA7103E276A2C2
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x2EB5FC149AA4211DF02501EB6941CEA1
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0xEFDDC74C954D6C65C2828832059CCFD7
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xB562D0D3A84FCF4B3C0DB6999C9084E5
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0xD15966627DD2523F771EBBC533179A3F
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x3537CAF0CAEA30173072F64B1CFF5065
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x543F621DFF11C6B77894E74FF2A4A180
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0xEAEA84C6AE901876BC20560E4676D23C

0x06C66D99AB1D59C75103BEB2398FC6A8
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0x694CF878D39E8A3018DA59636B21F382
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
0xC8BAA08F138E9EEE42BEEA461802427F
