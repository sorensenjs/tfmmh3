A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x0F235555AE069A50AADCB6F5F89C1EAC
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0xE33D18D507A5AD10F3DCA9D7D871EDCD
miscellaneous remark.
0xB8A5B1772AC84889D30CDBC29C9299F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0x48EEC1620112BAA5C65EC4F61EE4E4AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x57642C61BDA9DDEDD20C9D94D3C76BCD
few pretensions.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x292628F7F777DE55618B7158C71E2B6D
obscure aspirant.
0x103B60F3B0139091E3E17A8CD4C787DD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0xC51802FAF3A6C24B00BEB0CC78BA24BC
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0xDA01D9DD12C39F4915D6327AF968BDCF
Author.
0x7620918E7620918E402A4126C27787B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x5DF3B0A3887F7E35A530851DAD2F15FF
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x251C5F5C32C955AC285AA949603CC6E5
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0x8F33DDF2396A070F80B0D45F41D3F3D3
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x88E97FBE2E4D90D67D6EA75E7D5EB99F
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x26FA7020EDFF4EE818C11206E199B5F1
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x4D9CD8A54C211E4567768E8341E74964

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0xDDA9EAECA8C426AC538B7420F3FB1245
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xFDB7B61417483D576530CDD8CD71A0DB
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0xF12F756EEB0CA947E69DEEB59F036486
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x501651409CF4A912E332BF782FBC2618
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x11BA98CDE9E32C847351BAD14E0BA1CC
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x0CAC92BC41CD12D4D31907701A2CE8A8
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0xAFEDB7E8717698D10992E11011B95F9F
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x32314972871C4FBD3F1A1A1554FBD0D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x6D7B3515FA633CD97A17CA8CF9B36DC6
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x178D42EB1D9A9BBD09492F33EA05E01A
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x929CFD2258913F1708164B5607E89BF9
Thorns.
0xC6ACAFE7C6ACAFE77AB8C2C4E1D34478

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0x76635FB8093B0AE862DB10078B1D6BFF
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x37E95E5BE726BC99C8748D940C222078
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x74C06B990756D37C6E5C9510341C4C44
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xD49F5973443CB29DDB4E6471F6C9DF10
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xD978BCF264DA354C69994F53BC7A15AC
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0x9496A0CDB38DC3270BB51E413F142062
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0x8021A00436991E7F1BFDBB0BFCA16DBD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0x5BBE8B57553507E53AFFBDBAFDFEB11A
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0xB3BF4705ABD77DB29E74F78A1D86C991
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0xD2F5F6CA0BAF27CE0DF178FF6938EF5A
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x64932F7418E671DD6C389E31FB35F67B
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x647C0C9116E8926450F5977DD6295BDF
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x52E3F6466CFA0B7241AC5F5589C1F403

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0x8C3C9DFC770DD06CFA898B9D08B217B5
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x7F93F512A0ABB32B2E87004FBCC5628B
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xD6A0127F31A616EF320283E786EBB982
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0xDDD7A1C88D69B0FF9AC19D093C2915B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0xF5278DE48DFDBE8364C58E8AB52A2773
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0x8FE84F0B82028FB1B039EC690C00D44E
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0xF2607BCEBD2A6BD9BEC132B5FF9477FF
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0xE2FAA57BFC29BD8F621B7932BEA412E3
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0x023143541C63709DC72FE378A7FFFE1E
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0xDC2DBD3FF946D6F5DFAA39700418CD81
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0x7D729BCD5CBBB42C9D0BC1FDE354CC3E
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0x9E866676267B4528FAF44392F4339D62
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0xE824C1E4767DB07B6531FFF3BF6D6619
Rimoth-Gilead.
0x1783E41F2D47DAAB4FEB1E2DE98E48AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x902986EDF419931D706A7A9DDE1F094C
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x64BBA23601AC149E498CC8D864B2A440
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xCF16CF592557429B35225BC262B47EAD
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0x093DA73E66AED2B8936BD509F437AC2C
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x3CD3FC9A8030EE444B18BA630D272204
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x9E20C050461A87331922A189DE778156
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xC0033A2E7E2CC5A4983E48C310CB6ED6
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0xA2C90794E4C1A2A349DA2B97D877DE72
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0x8B9DFADB65AF38D61BE23400628EDA53
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x2453208DED0D7A0B16A8A15C89A2AEFE
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xB3A790ADF21436F9033A74EE07935D35
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x45793DC4F2AF1B3642C0EB6A9B42CB7D
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x5DC3C2D6B4E54C522B2F571E4D4DF4D9
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0x5CFA0D94A710C578770941EB4471C682
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
0xE902718EC6445AF2CA28AAEAFEDFC1BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x373876A367BD0E7331A3D61FBC48061F
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x5E15606F6892A0A29CD0EDFC1BCF58FE
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x9F89E94B677A3C80C620A42FC1D37674
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0x786CE19B4E5454506B5D872B4AD25CCC
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xC324AB288EC5A78FB819FB0792957F73
denied where it is justly due.
0xBB178C60CB9BA6205A9A6B7D020D7C72

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
0x471FFCE11FC61A6A95361A2DA5A60377
been made, and to prevent future errors.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x93722F8CAF6F826CF0E9183C79C107D6
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0x30E52D65A2A0C7CD32B86418E34EA32C
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0xE88A6709FC6FF4574E58BFDE7FDCC9A0
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0x948727237589CD5B681629755751CFEC
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0x3BCD507C97868C76534B32727BAB7FBA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0x6057D70F952916005DAAAC2AF8A3B019
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0x1C0B5A70253E6E65F3325280458549DF
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0x282CD6BFE6C44265BD20BC4C49109B60
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x142A84D20238DD8E2E3DF742BE58F7C1
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0x59C48BD7AAEC784307884FE9E946515A

The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0x592196165736835F55789577CC20F459
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0x52B8447B36A6A3143ECF54CE3B2A10C6
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0xA942E84B1EA72202DBC0DE356741BB5C
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x51B82DA3DD5E6F6910F19A4789C198C0
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0xB3837C1660DA6DEBABC55EB580287CD5
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0xC0CDBF226EAE7DA77EF0CBCB738B1F45
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0xC4CB260221D6A8A96ABFB48CE8C6EF25
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0xB7537B200A39E10E8C69B4317652829E
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x48812F8D8DDF93CCEC7C21F47ABEB682
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0x72CDD6F433B24452EB5DE08A37874F8E
little children."
0x93CAF721CFB22BC6F073F6521F130DD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0xE76E795741C37A1904876DF12B97E74D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0xF0DCE44D6F9D4AD8E17234AE98E64A90
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0x2E0926A97BFC1210896904876726C2F3
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0xA12E1EBE26EE8325E245C3C4DA90F832

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0xC1F551818FFDC0F082717276E33E70A0
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0x470E81A225F359BB0554D773560C922A
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x0389B33F1F61842335F794B927496680
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0xE3A93B2BF3CF782D8519105DF451974A
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xF641D89D3F78D5BC5BFCB5D3ECDD167F
retirement.
0x5DC5C0CD2C56A8BF13725AE2C07FA2D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x4ACD0EF22FA93C8037094A732556A9B8
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x118613B6B4612CEFA750BCC10ABB5010
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0x7A2FC7DDD149E7446189D60395371DAB
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0xF592319FA6293E35257715E8D3B48696
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0xB95DCFF2DE315AB9245488DBAED3F58C
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x258521A2E09601E559D11E15DB3297D3
lamentable blast.
0xA11C91B714B4FB25C5FE67AEC204BA23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x6CE3871BBD7F6977312AEDDD6B905460
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x217172EDF47BB7AE1E81126D1833E652
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x5891BB8C5AF01356A17661C03A821EFA
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0x03AAFA93BBFDB8DA5787E764557D2F77
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x183A506CC5DB83E799F5217B612C30D5
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0x2E2D20CEDBD51F7F0220136E91950B3C
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0x0636173459B62F5C675A9154699FD165

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0x606931CEE3F9DE267192D4DF1E752452
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0x90C64965A7ABC34F93786AC9C6B1B28F
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xEECA6749EEA2778F1FEFACED78F63875
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0x996D21C54E64E67C8F11B4BB332A3DA2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0xA386CFAE45B031C4DA7133FAB24BEDCF
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0xCBC51A3D4ECCCD7926F3451ECA387771
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0xF770138C90607100247BCBBD0E385F7B
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0x168937E06F10A240C8777BC443397FE9
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0xBDAF1A6C95D90238B7AF4C166D06CF28
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0xF3A442933445FD168DF0031DDCDC584C
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x14B27B4D3EC66AC482D37AE23D7D7810
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x87BB687B833EE603A3429DEFD5AB160E
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0x2E2B87326C4B09091794F7AE62E8569E
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x3E6D31BE85216B38CBEF5226BD0AF824
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x621359F669B259FBA7E1AD6F2E693380
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0xF649173963956F35CE2A17200F1F305C
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0xE97DAF4DC2F711C6780565CF136E4EF6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x30A78118B23F2691833B3CA6F7CDAFBC
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x18A9D9B7236A5A8EC6278EC36A00E080
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x129FDFDB4F6AF28B799A6D2708324687
hour of eventide.
0xA9123F88560780A1232F6A427D1971BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xEFFCE53A705DCB83D5E9F6F428941944

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0xE76FA304C8319EDB718F737050E06F3B
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x4DA32838A82C0C10C883AE2E41D38A20

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0x5BE1E58F9B47D92CD87BEFF396AFB8E8
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0x07E0FE0D0EDCA035401E02E4119E3ED9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0xC1355E6B6163B985549E250CF23F636F
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0xF51BEE656C65F763D69C6B41760F7B1C
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0x2C2E2C757E752D44C43B411C4A0F3EE3
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0xF9839D98459BDC2CBEDB404FDF10C936
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0xF450846E3F1BF020D129F820973A7263
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0xBB3143E91670FAA214127253A29A9AA9
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xD9480198A5D1829DDAA583DEB9995635
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0x86EC80EDBA10B19FF7F383BC74B3D499
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0xCCDC904A9F56CD995664B447C70A8D6B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x8DE72E8990160DD746576E5C30BFD906
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0xE9442CD65311631FAC3BC47CC772FD49
room door opened.
0x765D4291DC08A929D0F2396A8B1D3527

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xA7778CE914F20315F9EECA8319BBBF4C
found the room apparently empty.
0x9AB4BA966A71918C87C4DEFD362C262C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x1B9AB2C7E8BEC822DCE99E0A0E4D75A9
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0x771BD360C012C97F397EC42B6D91F193
animal!"
0xEF6B7C2AAEBF22E1487A069BC8E84EA8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0x36D28BB72C18A6048759E171FB7448EE
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x3E6A0F4D29BE13252C8E8B7C9D7C9B02
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x3B6239034644AFD80B4FAC3FFC589A95
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x84BA5AE5187E27E02A4089243B0DDF18

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0xC07201C7C3509AFC7B92DBCB7A12429C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0xB4FBDFF8B010EB1253A6D632155712D1
forth by the said Jack.
0x7E842BC3DBD5A615698870C2FD281B31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0x3EED6ABDB869D97247860776264E5D10

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xC09567FABD7B86D572E418C2EE2A921C
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0xC84E57EC98756C8204074FB1059F9C39
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0xF12A95CB9FB7179B7C04C4CD02483D04

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x9ED6B6253AD84B0B1CF9EDDAA249BEF9
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0xA28A76D5298277FB7CB94BAB5133C86F
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xE59AF8E1CF9085FD1516FF743B358D7E
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0xEB0026BFBE2400E96AA2C0F9EC7AA6B4
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0xB6212687CE73994F65987B315F48C171
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0x779FF8C332AE7578A16A2D6332513BE6
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0xF6F046A736FB85BBFB2D8E9D5726AC04
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x5BEBE0D50238D2F9B6261666102AC118
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0xB1EBD49845F4B13B9046757A8A1AC90E
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xD1CEFCCB627F4399416C18B1DFFAF41E
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x125B66881A81342699ABF82B730FB4E1
home.
0x2830989B2830989BF967AB3A07471B88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x548DC1C8EC62E769D3FCE843F8C355A8
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xC12EE10D2FF4DE6D518AFC16032F83D8
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0xACC852D225FA28999054947850336D3D
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0x3EF8F3F97D8588DB14CC6FF4BA2FA460
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x3AEA0DF7EC9CBFC245430599086E4BA7
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0x9ABA5F8108D5ACD9B2743B4BE78CE795
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0x1FA5EC2DC57602746EBDBA61B1B5AE49
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0xA24E88D8900528E508FCBC2B17040EDD
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x8EFB5F985143B5F7C90D35DDD7F55837
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0x86BB8A0A8D3F1B91917D50B2DCC8D0C2
her back.
0x7545F2AFCB1A8556BBADDCB319FCE933

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0x18A59FE6C8197D164E243EB531D0A1EE
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0xC7CEB3878A14019F83D39F717BED2953
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x80609EAF9C938C7BA9B9C4D7060421A9
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0xDC0AE3B98E3B215A07169DE2272518BF
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x9616D24EC17990CF9798FA7906ADFF15
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x62CAE4472D0EF69158C933D528109CD6
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x78B5C42F7C6555003660C2C5BDD07495
chair.
0xECFE7F54ECFE7F542D33BDD93656A81A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0xC8F5AA14020D141DD4FDDF61610AD3EC
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x4234D86343A34F58F82AD1E33AE9432D
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x11BE2AB20CC8920D25C95982B379165A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x966EDD5EBBDFDF3EF1426DA71306CF8C
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0x8631281280088E8EA4888F83C8D990E0
insult.
0x054D0929054D0929389E1721E63A3707

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0xEF667534D7D898F3296AA7CD3FA5222F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was reading."
0x4051133DED731EA8100BC715DDF16121

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Show the book."
0xBD08BE9CC8821C9D496F7A21EF3F2A75

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0x5E2E4E55DD878097AEE2F0415498031D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0xD4E4F75B91EAA9292A1F66782D75DB3D
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xC024FAF2C39BC96FE0E0E44BC4BC6A46
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xEDF691E429428718C23E0642B681DFAD
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x2AB2AE5E6022DB2EEEBAA1D56C4E1AA3
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0xE787295F11A39D99EB711D1A542515E0
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0x19A5CC3269454B7EA10D915AA9D8870F
the mirror and the windows."
0xFEE6C571ED58F4A24333955D156122DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xA08F81EAF822E8D800C35A63B6702228
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0xCD16CDF0A00CABE909559E10261508C0
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0xEB37534B9409C042AADBFAA11A62D1A6
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0x6F9CA7B73B06B89B343F2F08048298E6
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x8EB957A3E3DDC0108C8F27228278C57D
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0x7E89E532E69D929CCC466D70758355A5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0xF0251F2F34946369AD0C56DA5B61D561
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x28CF42B90B01267474D6D266302A6117

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0x25F0C9EF1EE78FC51F5EBCA302C5D456
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0x84AE873F474A7C5D73C0D42C3F8237E0
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x0617BB25EB821F01CD45BC40EC6E9F8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x6B7347D8A55DCBC0044B0F91B65F631B
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0x7F5509BF1F21BD09A33B6F878B664BCE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0xAD426A47E2BB62D44448A2FC90C6C582
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0xA1DA4DC29B39AA7AE8C5AB64D216AD32
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0x29F24A7DD975CDC8E996477782621C7D
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x26B46BF948575EEF8FEB836807BE51F3
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x2F4F27C0D43A95F1479D90B53196EEF0
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x8072C71CEFF36F57236D3EDF01B0079B
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x45047A116CFB7D7E6C59A30792E42433
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xFEA6BDDDD6CC295FBB91E17A1959D035
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0xD669EE4ECA8EBFD2F7D15B9ECA8F19BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x4E7FA09842F4AC656A78253B580BF411

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0xC788A385671C698A275FBE06FB5C913D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0x83F5CE55AF72E36788AE3115E209422F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0x648F98C205E7F40C2BF4CD3D53E08536
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x20552F9AA58C3D786A7C170483858379

CHAPTER II
0x4DDD25D3C3975C90AA9986BE7B5FF1B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0x8E3F4F7CFC9DE1F36950BD5C05361BF3
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0x754037651C21B01E59BDC72882438191
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x7E4861FC5C7F0CAD9DF7BE5AEDE0E641
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0x8B852C8B37A76930CD97E2EE31271267
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x151C72FCE02139BBDCD1032DAF233B68
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x146903AC9B12FCC08E6BC124D7EBB905

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0xB8A88D98CDEC79909832C86135F35CCF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0xE8B1176DCBD4C94C1EC9C8F0057BB4C2
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x25D107F9422DB4340342938567F154E2
young master."
0xB067018497FC4E6318490719E1C61113

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0xBC3D8DFBBDF94B81F1E05632E00693FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x45DEE2A22E4A009FD69F629D4751628A
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x4F396D1635483E88BFD90128FC86C68A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x6F46BC4D835D7A95F46A25A8794739CC
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xD7415082F5BACCB62756086DBB7E528D
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x73D7538BD8EA0AEF2812AA3756958555

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x67B622C65DEA7454AE9200B5181A607D
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0x7EAC8E538B0BE67F7F13F9851B6CD5D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0xE6BACCF312BE0C3BC4BD7E694F950CAE
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0x41C8C3962F75B47058EE92ECE8C29F31
little of the excitement out of me.
0xA9A2E27EE9976BC8DC0F1BCE7EF2D43B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0x3F5156EBE42BE16F631ADC104C6CE9D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0x900DAFC0FED7F817E9D61D78C17342DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x0299FB2BBDDE4E0AFD7FC3227330857F
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0xB26936D6D3FAE87DC8E6EC180FF9EB44
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xE4719B686DE62D62B87FB3ACEBD27E7B
incredulous of my sanity.
0xA8EAB41747940C62015D9D67A57DA274

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0xB2C2EA465F2C9736547CBE76311FF01F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x9F343032BF2BE984465BA5EBA3AC8F45
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0x6DBD6A0A11C7580E2E3C95CAFDA0AFC9
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0xB2679863BF28AA42BD0CB67B5A2297FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xD1653140E486CF83630ED90431F587F4
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0xCDB5AF07ABF2A89A7FFD0A7A7BB83AE2
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0xCFC5FAD6C5CA5587DBD0A47C158139AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0x66F4F6E8D484AAB296521C848666F6A1
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0x19CBEF4FB30C4E0387BA49DDFC2B1B42
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xD3FB7C5EE058034C92B050E2B1B6C8DB
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x201E85163A3D257FD543FA829AFAD113

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0x0302B27E2B9186D851BC3706AF477C81
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x0D49014FC4B445545DCE305FCDA69E1F
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0x3408D7BBF94790FAE735F501D2F2F8AB
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x2B34403CC162AD74EC63A04E17144708
them."
0xA219CF11A219CF113A33BEF521CCE76E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x0BA2354AC815EDDF71B8ACF0CD7E7F2C
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0x520FB38BF9A23411E35B800E93A7C3DE
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x8434CA636392A590E35EFFC057E98521
away, I am sure."
0x5C54A874FDBD0C217B9ED52443832708

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0xC27E047EE4C80D67F22ADCDC64162229
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0xCB0D2D9D7254E7DA806BA4336F8BAB82
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x98F7BDA122E37823EA1A3FC0E86E5396
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xAAB31B45F0E7F898523DEA876DEF6503
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x49DE3A49BC16603DA5F057E9415125D6
fetch you away."
0xA6F97EBEF931BCDAEE1D6CA996588A22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xFDDFD21542C61CCFEB957FD98F4D0015

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x16845DE23418462CEFF166A85DA6D9DE
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xA818ECD7928DCE689B93CCA27B6FAB07
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x03B63C1A165BFB09D9A38AF2F6EE6163
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x043325A1F43A5976DA31E2D14892C2E5
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0x439A4103ED084863EE1968B368DF1FB4
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x4B2EC8F5488891019198FE588229E631
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0xBEE91C0AFAED362CF1F99613D4DFF06D
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0x1AA722B4179548B8096048282A5E0F82
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0xBA529F5A61032F16B4229444D2DDD690
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0x497CBF962AAA1C568631ED44915D9160
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0xAA307A5D418CEE7DD4BF9E4784D67EE2
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x34CB854793FB730A5B20F0E699D00BE5
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x9E866A2245051B9DF1B362C115384C5A
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x4F1B3BC5875D4CD4143ECEE0922DA3C0
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0xE4285D9FBD20C764D30049D8DF0E8B31
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0xC788D4F697456DCFDFB57168AF3FA3D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0x434D6E7D498735BF06AF204D1894BB88
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x51D1A75BF4E56C41C896CFA923340B0E
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x7CE8700D5ECAA915F72F5CEF910E64C1
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x49F8E85ACEA7E59B32E1EEBB28A6197F
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x03D3E3B085CCE6DA7A63CABC89A6EB9C
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0xA888AF59B87DEDBECA8043E9C9D09088
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0x038D6E86AFA5CEA5BF71B58107DE2D55
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x234084B0B4B76FEA00ED376C8080628E
in spite of its grandeur.
0x0115527FE5E5BD81363058A376ED82C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0xA1F2BC2C750860F6E901B9A6453C9309
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x937AFA28B067003F7B77190A3575DE2F
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x80CDD379DAC5ACC0DEBF3888B9FD4F8A
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0x846F902F8D0779DE0330650E4618C9B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x6E0EC6B1FD924306DF16ACB23336E5AD
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xADAEA44D3D3D9F458EB20C0CC7D09B83
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0x4BC3DE9C3BC2555C373E11AAA915D586
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x710CF2D1250E5E53F12D9175C71C6CD0
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0xAE941AE723753F87C32DFA11D7193AE2
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0x5A5C4CD346EF3128B6FDB772BCAB6820
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x1E29E79AE173BA75691F1019BC642FDD
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0x42C48984FE8CD37489914FCFD9DD8909
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xC220DB617C10D6B341D859FFB328C972
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0x53756AA94E5024BDB116A4DE0A827A3B
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xA0E50E8E173D6649888F64FAE17D4E4C
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0xFB02F5AA5D621FE044F0A4418CB2A804
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x9FDB2B82C25645E31824165DCB803022
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x4C9054B678EA9E5B7139603BDA728206
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x77ECBB981BAB19785EA833CD32005A0E
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0xE0D3302CE003CCCFF76857CDD9B8C41F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0x7C7E72B3CAE34A4369A38FFE26978ECB
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x6A0608DBDED273BF6FF8EF92C36DEC8E
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0xD79293934342B71DBAF45BBE67D6EAE0
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0xA27CCA476339FFFC1B13BCE06E895EE9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0xAF6F5D8BC71CA1F0A413D933EF371756
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0xB401D8F68DC955D089C337B62D566F87
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x53B57A31E11F3BF4F2B9F1B4E73561EB
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0xC2F1A960E6EC69CA37310EFFBBDBD122
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0xE8D31444F98042E5BBC515D344DF1D48
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x7258573C8CC2731A86FFABF0D2CE7F3D
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x97BBB3FD5EDFF06E739B46453F242409
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0x40F4D5BA6609EA25CA341B38C7A2B9B5
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0xEEE503A4EDC99C740649EDD5E069D463
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x054FC9E9D9186377183395543FFCAABD
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x87BE7F5593036B66CA4D1056D5192D6A
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x400FE427D647EC0F81855EDECC1A92C6
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x31A8B2E9C29E124F9F6B4AD37DDB08B0
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0xFBF185E63A946C288E6F4F566A9990D0
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0xE1DD328DADB7A3AE541861563AC5C14F
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x174E832ABF969E715A3C8E64805EF2E7
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0xE880D9A8D57B52EF5C76D70CA993ADF9
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0xA3D24D48D9975DAE0C4C57E7A02BF310
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0xAE8B9E72C2AEBE9F791E583EAD05DC3E
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x84CFF813AAF3826716E86E95ACEC2334
general opprobrium.
0x16A62AB2E90C321A3ED57AB01B1B6DEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0x895341EF452947A883E5E22E75259C0B
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x8485A5A7739B461ED73B4551AB896AFC
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x16AC3B22D8ED872362205C0F73C79BDC
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x0058A5C356203F2F79951C8BD1BF1292
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0x287B0933658B53CB1BE61F8FEC049C83

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x50EDD78A115F4727E6E28B9CB8907977
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0xB0BD9C222006EC0CDB794111D0B6F8E1
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x7D2F295442BEA2B178A4D99138170A54
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0x44D88F538DC4039808332AC5F4E429D0
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0x4C78BB8D86340DF100D4C4C1EA5715B4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xF496DD77D0AACF749146BBA85A986DD0
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0x31D5465A2E0D0A209EF7EFD3D1F146AF
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0x0072024C856263DB5C7D8D79A970BC53
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0xA4F1C50FD9ED71071CAF74DD29D8D386
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0xB4B009D148F7FB4ACF67A800841F1E32
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0xB894B2FD9665DA6F2B0307AAFCA7AE22
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0x1ACBABBFC0CA7B041ABCB2ECA0FDA5DF
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0x0609F450A1CB09E65766FCF9A635040E
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0x3D990464AB4EFBE84701DAA0A6B41D0B
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x5E184C52BEDEEC64EBA71B0A89A86A70
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0xB5A9D73D8493E1D5FB468BEDB2A496D3
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x4F116AF001BDD77D281C3D380C788F85
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xEBA2C3E782DEB4451ECE6FEA864EEB4D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0x9C5862EC3362D20B2DB046C8F8D5A1DB
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x36D8A6594D93FB5C0CA6F20E3FBA0055
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0xEE1A7EEF32679158C6B140A24077343D
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0x3EB912B79B15036564CCF2923471E3ED
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x05B796075C0CAA6584452308CF37F76B
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0xE796959827CDED3860846168DC1D28A7
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x1714D1C1273623CE18D415699D80EC1E
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0x391C53D58ADACA4A6800DC1C4BF5099D
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x19CD16FF5A7EEAD53DC5AC2D4D7D1767
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x0F3A98FCAF9F579F510616CBFD380012
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0x51CB667146DA631C74E1D2DE26C9279C
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0xB4EFF860CE6892FC68A0317CDB38DCB7
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x755235FBE9D8F3E0AF4EBB4DA06223EB
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0x8C04D2C8D7EE534F52325984E49CAE3A
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x047829491ECC2283CC634A582A457C20
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x36F690C9ED14102C636AB77DAC42CC02
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x5D269B8C37A689723112E05D0B8AC8BB
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x8254311EE4E65A27287CEF84409810B0
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0xA18E9AEDE1B11C88041A82FFCB3BB143
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0xF2735F9C7EE16B94D694C76EF87F4477
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x270A56BC01D4353630CA9FC67DAB4C95
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x68170D85B55F1DDD57A19D4EBB0A6BDA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x3A3A017F6071C7328AE3698C208CDE39
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0x079CD0F1909B975CDA75CF942C7B6DE6
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0x54B3BD8E6726692AAD7DE86F1908E965
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x39C065FA995DFD6F748808FAF65A6DCA
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0xFB43322B823A244E15AD45D777951622
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0xA7F5CB674C2A6A42FB0D4C72FBCA48BD
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x7B62F5F312B7FC7FE7DD7BF98E37EFE7
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0x9A303CC676409DBBFDA966C44FE4B5A6
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x1BEDF3CBCA0B04F2143444D78E086EB8
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xCDB9B0AD569255A41CAC967AF7995A89
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x44EC2687C3D34CB60FCA2848A629F4EE
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x97E23EBE67B5FF6AF4BADF26BFF060E6
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0x946BDE30A66F57C564316E70FE4D765A
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0xC757363436AA826B1F2529BCFFEC902B
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0xDA17E720369ADF672CEFD352E5FDBD5F
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0x3BA194A6BA8140250645E1D41D8EBCD1
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0x5944C7C6C709E63EA216B099E27632A3
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x597270414A50EE36FB775556F4F5BF1F
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0x9A234B2176610B687FF3674303FEB538
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x18990717982B16AB9424D5CDD06F3D62
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0x448022B59BF8306FB27D4DCB7284CCDC
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0x4C94951122733D5BC8CCB104AC6D9CDF
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x55C0A1BBE736210DD94D30776516B8BD
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0x65654EE0CCC3F878DC0614C988F83CBE
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0xFC188B50F12559CD1CB58EC36EA48370
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x6182A61DF9960408100433910B4C63F2
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0xFDB72ED9D678855B790B8C97895D067B
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x20615F5B9118A320286097669652172B
Abbot entered.
0xED4CC3782945F7D5201CC81E928417D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0x5A833A8A3B52471789C6306118942FB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x08DA3B4470CC213B841B0C66A7F45356

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0xA270AEF26825C44207A58D628E189320

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0x250C5495AA0FE26C672FDB70853F5A22
Bessie.
0x71DCD30971DCD30943D518E14F215A3F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x70D3CD3CEEB261BA906A8380C948EE99
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x796C2AFDBB65CDFD1C9C1FF44122EEFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x4C46B08E68657CA5EBDEF7792DC806A7
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x7B9A252D5B405D452169BEBCC563B7C3
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x410EF0042ABEFF475705C667129C5A7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xA163CC217CA959448568638E7AB14D19
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x6633B2A48C9F6FF1874990B165AD9ACE
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x294AAE3346223F923832C701A84E21FB
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x2D785FF7E4D55359850C6B0094EAFC31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xF7AEDE88C5B4F3683590ABDED4F8064F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x3783EF822341E4BC8BCA3026D77B4BC2
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0xFE3060982F90F209189BDBEFE6094086
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0xC57B97C1824A6FABB456B7C7FCB5E545
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x19BE6AB42A0B5188A509FCA9B9DEBEEC
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0xA554A9B0E9A745B9B82F52EE470E7CF5
then."
0x96D5B1DB96D5B1DB9DBF76AC24DA37E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0xAB9816CA4F08B71CFF44BC122B03E9E3
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0xE4BFA33E3D08F24FEDDA09F5EE488423

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xA5A194B662F8A176554B323FCB655B54
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0xF97D6239AAAFD5091B951016D54EFF45
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x8A6E30CBA58FAE2771A7FF540DAB857A
duplicity.
0x562F3079152B7ACEF1D2647E8CFDE0AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x965D2C241371EB9D059EBB0481A4BBEE
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0xF320B9EAB1C924C96D85E29D5CBEA313
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0x6DEDBF8067A3D93AFC7923FF16303DDA
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0xDDA450E039F944C25ADF84306A16FB12

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0x485343D9A09DD80F3113E43E445873B2
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0xE51EA443A323E953C4B19A456FAF0E98
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0x42049CAC65EEF25FDC70C20AB7EB6BD4
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x8A3B0955B5614029411C8C2488E22328
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x9EA3E81EC1A1964FC117E403B69B427E
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x200EB22FA92E1B013CFA11E92AF563D2
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x3B181CC0F0E3A5D9003710B4CE7E2956
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0x0D1606B6DDB4F7D30A1703D0C9239ABC
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0x478AB960A07D165321FAE4EBF01161B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x4D27A30ECAD3976E52AB58266A567028
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xDC1EC738404FEB2A066A4AC8D71B081B
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x44AEF3A97F4CD0CE05B5DF81A544C5DE
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0xCD5B141D33D6940EB40CF56EC7D22F91
pillow, leaning over me.
0x00C8851CF09D64E774626BDB940D94C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xB4B8269CB783A95A765946EA14C38C0B
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x7677403A2610C04CCCC5693ADF1AF910
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0x215507DA8093658ECC849795136679EF
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x9CC07360D89004929CD16507CE69BDB6
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x4F6986B811480C6D2B7126FD2A78CC4F
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0xBB453449C6150F4726290902D27983A2
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0x16F7FCAA15996B4F713C60B7C9015112
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0x4F1D9B97DFA1A2F26A0774A7610C0C9F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0x7ED6B055991C09F3AC20ED31C434022F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xB0D1FA2FCB8A01C7E2101F5F843A3EC9
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0x63131CB7BD0EBC2BE7737BB7058F12EB
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0x53F298A424DCCBEFA043E22D32DE598A
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0xF90B192FD20FEFD8CB10442109B00B38
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0xF2593360AD238399955AD19D1359DF52
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0x0E505305D2A777F39B0F3DB633075290
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0xC0993F07F0895464BC4568D33D911B84
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x47F2FE303F935736035FEC9539AAD14E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0xFBBEEF5C7E7A5AE1158AFD05F2FABDEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x957CC1A5689F8DC752997E37057DAA23

Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her

say--

"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xE49CA95DE25E37A498108379B03F6D89
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0xE2BDD668B6003F7831A7F3845067924A
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x907C7ED41C1DB6A62034FF6544CB386F
rather too hard."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0x8CFD06AAE16A928EC2B222720C725148
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0xF82A25917C66445357EA1AD75B6F525B
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xD5FF3696AFAC96D1D331A429E845C824
the main subject discussed.

At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0xA38586A7B103471F4B91FDDFB859C829
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x8682EF01516F97759394B0B422D76658
dread: such dread as children only can feel.

No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0x28351E89C3472B84E90AAC6E37D395A2
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0x6F6F4931715A12BEAF7C5CA9B8A3CD48
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0x80E2B377E1C828C71F4BF4A2FAD52E76
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x336F1968EF519C7D00655BF2429D2343
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0xBB4D878E8370FE0D0EAF823703A65807
bad propensities.
0x3438B45DAD792713462C14471B2D1478

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0xA5BE477ABE4872B6EFC82365C9EBD748
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0xC51D8426A8CF38AEC3AC7A77188E7FAE
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xB5609D44897B8BBA288B81AA8B9D1313
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x9BDE09E2C16429EDAA613F32843991B2
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x4A1497E2C68789DE84804E34F897A314
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x88950B6F3956709998B01C098E261572
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0xF0050EE973E9173B2059B5C90004697F
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xB09BD1247B30A27C82320EBE92B2B506
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0x7A026FE83C1EF46A1DC0DD8335A96B84
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0x9B1F93B636F397DDB17CB8EA41E1E126
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0x79E90B578E0D8C95CA2F80B2B629CB80
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0x3D1282043A116C2AF8C5B7B8893715C8
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0x1B79FAACA164DE01720A8CF4392A2B9C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0xC5DBA7D81B53E1D503EBE51E344EAB27
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0x1514D337D1BC2A9FA97F8852607E30A1
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0xA642C92FAB88BAE4A032F53BC834C62F
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0x4A2A5CD3EF01595AE06623B0EE801DC8
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0x2A297FF352629E299668C1F045DC7B92
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0x67AC03FB179B93C23FF1F53C8084CC55
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0xFD3A4310DFC777328FF8D27C0F51B360
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x6301C7F01C7CF1583A9B2F6CE4F86CF9
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0xDB18A76C9FC79E6DF2018A907A136F22
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0x346C8FB77666BC707701DD7627B47F2B
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x94CAE02C270EEB10BDB93407F238C70A
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0xFDFD020D7B64C911ECF81607998DF4A8
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x162D6FB294A3623BABB3D2354B07FC65
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0x659E09A9771BBA6B46B1408B5A8A67CB
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0xDE106CE40D8A6E0F4D0945E153E089FC
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x0B9A4AB5E89CECC91B2B075F12D0F39B
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x682C6EDDFE34231CA3EAF02D4D642C66
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0xD7B4D3A80F063A404C079A04FC19A489
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0xFEF9A027A34B8D32E9A667B97366BD64
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x2EE065225C55DECDFD7C9A2D05A4B0C3
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x107136676E501F4243F6E340DE14B604
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0xB4AE6B987DDD3E7CDEE11D499DF433DC
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0xB4509A7D88039D9BCC014C4A8A553AB8
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x299437DB40C52E4003CE669778016210
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0x3240C567FCFF829BB9B0B509167850D4
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0xEB721223D60FE1AF64E73C61669E967A
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0xA9767CC2B4D5785232F913320264607C
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x9AA47516AB8614DE1A90A35DC99ACAD9
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x60920ADA00A52CAA8A6DC71F2183D067
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0xD121917DAFE4159C9632108362A8B89F
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0xC3CA9D49EFF9CBFDED631B20EF42A9BE
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x36865786C4AEAEEAAADEB20C94AD16F6
untasted tart.
0x15297B00C72923A2E50A24BB7057843E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0xF301DB4AB6E1A7C7F0E9E6B2AA1DAAF4
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0x1A24F02BFED8A143A4A366A75A0AA3A6
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x79E71F35AF56D68367FDA26DF0B8B6A4
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0x10B22538372D5D7CD4521C255FBB12D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0x570940E6A4631A3AA203FDE01AFC99BA
      A long time ago."
0x780E05FAB7A6E92AD92E5F07FDF55262

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0x679BF94A04E283885AFF1CFF19B20B4D
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x719B4D9FE2E20A1304EF97F42E100714
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0xF3B8C0408755A53BD97F598936049C1B
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x81A4B5B0CFB5FA83BB93E0C4B007BB8C
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0x84378592F1B9EDE1D855F72EAAEA3201
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x52961923DB6800E4AA96974DAF1EE0AE
one.

"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0xC25219E931CBDA4CE7C4427DD277163B
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x1A95B5C61208CA5A0AF5D3E6DF50C6ED
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
0xBE1297561AC8096F9153A28B93C0FC29

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0x59E367B7B0C1C7B54014FAA1E2B0422C
Have you any pain?"
0xEB29B02E558CE69311E5480EEBD8F878

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in

0x77C415AC881EA71EE58D2DC3EC6FDBDE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x4FABA2AF69AC22A0672CAF38EFDE2D17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x18BEB3C07A25C91ED339F6B6050CEF09
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0xF3572B04BD55233822551CB617041092
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0x70152BEAF1219499731EC7F7F50A4F1E
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x23CB8CF849673CFE1F6948015E3010FC
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0xD92E54DD411A89865FF448E52E452DF3
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xC67A9AC933F6EE3BFA6CA08B0A9C554C
leisure, he said--
0x70692921AC1736337F828A477F447830

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x50A6C4505C7CCC46A7189F58A0E964EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0xC9957223B987B514B01B7EBACA856C17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0xAA74A3E90E13477712C95A6F23658C96
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xD0E36BA52D048C4BE9CA802F1E9D3CBE
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x7BF49600FCCB7075A8D59BEA0CDE273D

As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x910EF8D8FD328157C7DB6CD88E3263FD
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x32888DF01A6BF3BD0F350FD4462CB6E6
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x6C4E7A2C5632159F1E6B0CF54644F97E
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0x8A8AFBF160C50B50AD11FBCCC75D0A3E
Bessie was gone.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x8528289A4AFAC0280FCEC372CF36414D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x8EF112119B5B727723716A438DCC76FA
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x717BF2FA790E6907FEC8269A59D3E619
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0xC5A92D81E6AE4B8A58257BC3FF11A1B1
that I think I shall never forget it."

unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xBC225DF5BA5391EF1B00C9856EC5EEAB
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x095882D986E1502C297E1A31765D4859
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xECCD9C4597773A01AFF3B05E52AA52EA
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x999B447292E9FD8236144D40EFB8C940
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x6054FB689A32E672B46B75835CE4BA7F
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xCB4CF6252FC8963498D567C8AE1B9907
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x3C1EC53610BBCC958DA7C86991CDABD8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."

you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here

than a servant."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0xF2AE72B49AFA1BB54E9D092BAD292647
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0xDE93E438E0BCCA37F6AD6E9EA2BBFDDE
them."

0x876CBF84CF7F707A6263D1017EA66D22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0xC526B01EAC97D889EED005F0B7A03675
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0x2E5F9FBC0585A394318A149C27E621B7
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x60634DB3DDEBF65F81F360D5B05C4162
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0x895B00B10A3B365D2FBB496E533C913B
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0xA52108793C85A63ACEA4441F013D223E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x4CC0C66F35EC579AC4EFACF41FEB6E63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0xFE9381F6D4D3FD81F958955ACF4E3650

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x9179D8B2E47950851D65C369AF10E027
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0x1C0DA70C3341E89772C5D2792BB4B503
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x98746CF5A563D4D51BB5AC84843C8F6C
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0xB87F135761CF673A1B4D3F2AC2CF83A3
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0x5D1C82B3091EB305C37FE8A6CEC5FCC3
the price of caste.
0x0DB691B8CD1E571ED8E38D0F97881135

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"

"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xD23EB31FFC03BD8EE8E87F1D13B318FC
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x313FB2EE3157857454BD4BE23FF8D7B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x8E03E03F400574BC4106DF4ABDB00A81

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0x59048E3E910BED1497D7AFFBDD237100
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0xA3BEC74423145FCF5BBB7406C094DB28
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x38AD2D000C46CE40EA0F44D80DB20915
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x015DDF0A6DBC07C536F694D1CF7F95EC
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x4B10439DFF1E30A16C313C10FAD53D91
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0x6DE7A0DF5E641EE49FFF8EF1C8256602
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0x28DAE44AE8C4C748D2EC320573EB54D9
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0xA651F987850666B42CCDC0905BAA1138
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xE8721296438F65B13E4FC772E6607BF7
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0xAA473CA66AF2162749285CF119769676
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0xB3D43F384901CBA771E6FA5B64D2EB83
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0xF77E2D7CA0668E298788A1B9BA22CC6F
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0x8CB2CB1ACC17988EF84E57C658E1FA6C
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x937C5383BB6569822EDDA270D55FAA58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x6592EB924CE88FCD43F4EFDA076D5471
musings.
0xD3F9C1D974CB59233C90E62543B71178

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0x0CA37A9210E3FB14FCE696BCA46D528F
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0x27C86804C201EEE4AF756B5E27980C82
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0x84CC30EF0EC6E1D1995BFB4256B60F59

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x6E14C9DE8B12DF2317B30210D536D614
the gravel-walk.
0x19117054C3EF8E2AA2326122FDA8CA0A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xE1EC01A931E08BADDCB89E42672B873B
to her before I go."
0x023F4E9EA35F36D484F516F54D4385B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x64AF7B393D7012FDB15395D7F569B572
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xA7FE886863B8775A4D25CE3E810D4703
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0x5C93132BFFF5D93C264FFA1662D33B14
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xF80FDD0168A29640D26B62DDD1B544AE
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xC993DBAAA252F1CF43632ECD68D1040D
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0x56680241C6788BF8EAC56C4349FBC1D0
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0xF6A3D67F307C954EB0BB692E4E4C5879
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x3B59FE9D5094EFD08B14BB5D0DB4AADF
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x745F9FC37017AF3E08DA4A719C34D8AA
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x8EE3D954A2F049095A61EE63AE1C6E47

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0xE52A80FB8A8F09896F0109078C1FD8EA
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xAC4475C6DE80F8B6C98DBA6E0AA31099
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0x4BFA9684CC4D5F9C311CB10EF5E035C7
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0x29346C5053A22FB63564B848A1F9631E
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0xBD10735AE47E02001A32C1948015786E
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0xE13DF2E381F60F8C15B0CC5844BD756C
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0x8E8EC11C70DF500DCDE25CE8298D54E3
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x1B065E7EC193E018196C5CCE78DBE86B
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0xC849A51A63A0A6CC97F7793EB8477D30
of each other.
0x1E129E36525001FA92EB25B535EB566D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x186620111BEF615FBB75B5A64CC6A09F
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x4F7B6BDDC526FCA41BEA1AD125CB3215

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x9730D92F0AECFF6379DFEC784714302A
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x9E1915CC2A1224D5811DD418163AC714
little toad as that."
0xD87AA854EA844C88649D6EB6A4D21EC6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x2FD034673D98ABE68773F8CC55CF346D
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
0xD50CBEEA02D5F8B5E412F2370153A210

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xA14939D30EB91830DB170565A7AADB5A
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0x6C1E5A9C9CE1C53573B477A8194A1977
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x32C6111F37FE4FC04DAD24EB24DAF50C
rabbit for supper."
0x7B18286274C48D3B573BD1BBF481D915

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

CHAPTER IV
0xB871DF451E13A6B0FF7B583FD5CBAA4A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0xF72FEBF9EB12833E19FA34FFF2F9487E
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x86E0E23B56C74A31866A2F3430D9C253
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0x617F4E1EC78B37008AFA8065AB1C7E66
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0x0BDA44AB55B1B9D4A2D7A1CE664BBCE8
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0xFC46927E70EE821433AFD8A79670E101
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xC42476114897432F82789B698AD3005E
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x7C3EB410DBC2E4E9B367F67022AE1AFF
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xB934D9725E7300148E536E5310E7FD49
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0x3F5632D30064FF7CF9656B26A6AB010E
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x99C52C62B586BF91BEA5490301AD6602
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0x1CFC1D7922F724B099D3403371DBAC0F
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0xE3DAA3785E3F11F46BCE30B0C78D5150
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0x52C1CDA0E2EC94B9E38D1EB9BC4F8DF9
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0xE4BE2A4006B2BEEE71F4C8BC8EDB72A0
and rooted aversion.
0xEC8D303404259D674A446FDB2A0B1B9F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0xD827A082871718E31A0AA9E7080A4CC6
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0x81338EBCEF842EF762AE686629685AB3
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x2BE72716510C4C89EEC33D3B6D603D2A
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0xF3839CA4F6DD8BFD2453E1E1112741E4
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x1B8EC831BC0FCF35F74CABF0E4A60FBD
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0xB60EFDC8308D3D3DB80A5BD951AAD541
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xD1C63D23799C38B57417200BE0B68D0A
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0x1DFD81998DCC4270AA8C4F791EA63FFC
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0x259FD1506B3EA0948F2FD116F7EEEEA2
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x464C0EBE0015F20615EB1A8398956F4B
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0x8C5E6E88CEA607E3EC64699A7848D5FE
was stopped rather harshly--
0x9874AF71AF56F969E01C72AFCB93572A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0x531D28C08B435BF90BB188CBE1D2A684
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0x9B36FC9F7D817C50871C5562589AB3AB
should associate with her."
0x7F312B948C2CF489872A9D52BE4EF445

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0xB0AAC79B26E30D5366AEEC09AD415DBB
deliberating on my words--
0xFC27A45069377D26F5D7EBF165B8A36B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0xA66DA1A22C71E3266E4CCAD564CF5BB3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x95C268C150045A9CC7A4CB9040EDFE98
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0xDED731E4274810CC936A43F1837AFF6D
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0x0C870DB2EE85EE600D21ADA667459F4F
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xDEA8E7B478A6B8FDC395905FA6EEB0A7
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0xA16C69AC19F8FCF12A5D1E8E158971AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0x76A2C990D120F23EA7E1983954396673
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x32AA7BBED1CD2EF0D020CB13D9B10345
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0x2F2EFC4B8468687EBD95B27FC3EE55CB
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0xED0AA8DE8B958A43AB48F60FCBF066F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0x2FE3AF598ACF6571157803ECA3C46230
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x9192B6F1AD39903719CD5D5FA79D6D90
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x706FC35F6638B2DE1A1A555195D8955E
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x715F63079EFD7D189B6B7DB6EA0C2D95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0x3B6026621CF1114DF7581C19693E17E4
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0x7BE3269C4C5390356EAD167177B184E5
wish me dead."
0xDF4805FD8160F7D85CB3A76B3D6E6499

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0xAA1C04C7C57DDC08593DC692E372A1FC
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0xA6D11CD2C13E2658D484D9FC8336BAB0
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x352DD4CACA6300721ECC3EB5BC8BAA5C
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0x6E316C8EBBA84525B7F007ABA6CB2D09
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x3AFEC309184066021152328034C76F4A
in my breast.
0x8AF7120677AB06C07F2425798A4F607C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0x4F4DB58071529874863033C7197AC55C
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0x81C309552255CED17BBFCF1206F68160
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x94DC14C6FDEA3F17D3FFE97DAB25F01F
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0x39AE934B5ED3ED5311467CB003EA16BD
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0x7C9DA50DAAFFEF77D0F707E0C7D55820
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0xE5E828D6926B2C56ACF1EE4680AC929B
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0xC9114F7FD25007EA7E6491A41AD1394E
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0xC7E9BC29CEDBF434FAA8F4920AFE3046
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x46A84A5EFC6FBC7E5370E200ECD00FEA
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0xEE92A405D751F4DB92D723F37ED3C0D1
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0xF626E52C3619C4591F1DBBBD2B827131
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0x5DDA068FB85C8A92A2D745DD785923A2
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xEBD52D5196849C658DE7E4E17921E139
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0x8C7B97997F07CA0980CB40F7C732A726
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0xF029F9ED09ACFAD03B9D9AF731420DD6
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0x9F0C8E1149DBDE33D31DBCBCF7515368
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x5202ACF5C08288CE5648781165170656
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0x9EE5F4ED2A954D14E9DABF769C15E856
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0x35CC2F5A0DEDA306A9532F1A07375B2F
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0x878D1EC084F41112402F72D6E056EBA2
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xC72E073D22E290C4E8F4FF21941F6B96
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0x4546FAA7719CE1F544725B9F2DBED393
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0x5964F58E330F26E1B92F126DE4D8B3BA
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x094750B71A660CA599C913D5A992C61C
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0x2D71E933D99A75AC07C230FF24D266FF
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x7E833EBD9530A54BCE9FCFE6A3A84DD1
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x7564ED085563E87913612E7EEE87D961
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xE0154516654BDEA3599D57E1CC59CA7C
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x8626CF25F21C36563D1DB849A91F3A2E
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x71DA0E191EAAA67AC691B27163902830
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xD8C147D2E6E7C5421EB20C0E19BAC503
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x3ABD3B93A03C45819618272FE0B94ECE
to be happy likewise.
0x56E7646C37CD84305C3B7A1329F8F27B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x25A5FCBBD51ACE9B71383DB068B8966B
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0xD7E96232D6F3C6ADE6BA0C8798206C5E
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0x97EC5E0FAA0CA43846C88DF16BB6E02B
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0xBFE4DF3BDEBB0E0CA5C3DE535F2CE48E
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0xDBF2B0E91F5B5648A3049F1FA8B05611
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0xEE0C540D1B1BC5CF5908E89406F5829A
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0xB676F0A747520E276E402967DEA15C3A
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x7E9195FB25F4C1BAA2E3555D0716841F
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x8C77D503621A3FFFEA6615539898034B
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0x0870734DCA97375C6C908D23B2C36B6F
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x1FB24EB181D089263183DAFFE764B2FE
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xF474E8C74C42400AC98FA163A496B810
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x7C62F5F85C6E119D245E885C4C0EDF09
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0x443511EB02040FE03FBB7C12D6F39465
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0x89B8DD318E673ACACBA0D5C2DB083286
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x1E04FFEFEE2B4470A7DF291DD590A713
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x1DF005E602227A88326A57AC52EF1226
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0x8ED34D239F477B694EB2A917444F1AF2
Gateshead Hall.
0xA9E5D169C0B781AB7F829FE53C512661

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0x9911BCFFCDA606863E6222CEEFACCDA6
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0xA698E980DA412B6FE621586985839303
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x68CC05181721787F7CD042CF5BA3196F
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x392B1EA43582C3D4797A630B4BDE9A91
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x8848FB1611634670D61612697689F174
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x3CA7FFDD8056ABE0A783A3978A798380
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x7A357010EA10E18DB62E65940411914F
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x1F88593B52CB336CF4F12B0E9EE7BF3F
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xE797CFE92B5105CB6CB0E349978FC74A
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0x989136F8AFF6EED5A1F6A6B73ED31BC6
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x5B9444F2397400CE29F538600400B09D
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0xE90AFF27754B1E4BB7EA557061E8D30D
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0xB8C6DF519CA1B455AC692501F89B45EF
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x9D1FCCF40731DA7B9FEDBE5B40D5AEAE
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0xF4E1644CC915128EDE6BA0F3C1D2A6A9
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0xE5CD86BB8D935E829F8091ED955939BC
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x70AA8F63FEC59916B90170BFBF90B3BE
accuracy.
0x3F71BDB13E9D9D2580306827A6D52CB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x71FE1A33042C7D8994683D2A1A127FF9
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x68768978C8E4F56711DB560514F1A77E
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x1FCE694C0EE5B7164B6D2C0644BA3D67
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0x3E2E6EDCD2E15287F1A2DE80D9F34807
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x2178630DAA047321FF7D5B09A9AC3AB3
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x2D371250D41BF0944F78CB45EC2BD10E
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0xDEC997BC444990B599C77231545FFA30
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0x439DB566C3EE35905050ED5B3E8C938E
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0xD42F7DC09B95F1901DA05ADBA16C88FE
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0xAC8242ECE1F995F5F6A56D195F74AB7F
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0x8D20F7DE755D5765E38561084121BDDC
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x72397990701394EEADD2AB0077B49848
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0xE9F273F4A24D7B57BFF8607F1242CF36
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xB03E287F301588E2A00E8BB3F23462F5
frost.
0xF01D1C0FF01D1C0F302D8FEBA79808EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x772F976D913C6472B7F07E4BAF521C83
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0x0E6FB4F9C5A227BA6C49993A2D5B33C9
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xA719F60C74A3A92DF18BFDFE912E074A
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0xFC34412AD22D4BDB081DFB7FE24A3FD0
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0x942DF74B2E614BF9C1BA8010F154DFA7
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x212E2419BF7CB7A73F66E88CF014EA4C
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xBA9AC65B630FB24AAD51F6DDEE6E8EB3
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0xF1F8FD3CFF9204349D32DA586C3788CF
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0x9C5886ACF5972296E2EBF265FB55EA73
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0x73CDFFB8AAE0A2763CAAD444997E5029
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0x6E7E20F9FAEBE6E0EC125B50732B3AB5
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x9F28376326B0B24D2D66A991C02944EA
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0x9D90B328280D7F105B153F061C0E004D
nursery.
0x254A7F0FF29F71AEDE47F0D8E062BADA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0xD4742283417644D9D321CC07029E95BA
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x8B65C80CA5A414986B9169A4771B9167
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x71902548ADEC1493CCE14850099C20FF
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x29F607F7DA85FF2E37480C398C12A328
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x1DE53B4606721FB37B5C5B3DDF413631

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x647D8A16DFB9AE40366E41D5B493405F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0x4297E8543DEC98841F80C4A3009D9E9C
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0xAC394F8FCBC9C9DC428F118C37768B93
window for?"
0xCC0F554F6BB57D637DD5A30AE552BE2A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0x4E2ED468C09F949A98C70C10915E507A
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0x9F94D26F9AB5E3069C727AD8A99FCCFD
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x2AED50CB3B3131E2D250B82D662F10BF
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0x445FB1F57005D55D20F6C4DC26EF3940
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0x052E877AFC119AFA3710FD809A983DA0
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0x22A50E6BA4EFF5A6621FC88EE3679E95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0xD49C834C76804C3CCEC548FFFFE3D0C8
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x68B9D6F5AF58776FDA014FB693AF175E
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x150C94BFFFEB07AF92074E90037FB340
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0xC341D9EBD0D37CD4B289C539E6907347
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0xC604374D68E8DE4E2E0E8733A0B41ABC
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x95DDF4F3331803960E7C0216226A2AF3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0xA197183DC982AB81C163F3D74DB571B4
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x636B38430C55DE7120386036E54CDB28
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x18C0C2B2FD3E52D582A9CAB70C549B2A
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x2CD3B61D8768DFD370FE147822C923A3
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x00DD619E55156FC94B0A3974F2F6AD64
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x0C029F039E92DE0FA080984F98A638B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0xAEA383A1662C163D0F4D456B1A01C4AE
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x00C7A5EE1121DA1755BC215977EF652E
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x3075F4BA2E2A4F360C0C1E1A4330B10E
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x6D70822BA779C1978F570A82E926915C
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x1D815C923E082076B86A44242BCE5D5D
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0x966A6FC9BFA83F73471F4F61F806A720
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x862FC1D389E6F6BAD7E68BCE5B4D41B1
by way of capital.
0x47DE4110D7D85F40CE7641D10FF3D869

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0x0E22D5D7FC739AFD695BE746039F3634
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x21466E730254CC6479508F9BB3D679BD
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0xBA3A9D69ADBCDD1CF6E5865FB77703ED
you."
0x53A52ED653A52ED6C8E9894D2835FB7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0xBAC8CE201F280FEBCA6245453F62F679
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0xA69075EE86858429D0B5FC1A1ED249C9
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x18C9EF62837C305C8C084DE398E61B35
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x0BB313DD083D3972F6D5C867CD8F57CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ten years."
0x3F08DFB17F0CCA476D41D3CB936A4326

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0x17AE36DCF985335671FCE61C45F0265B
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0x0448F603855C9ECC0869CBDCBE584B14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x4CCCE312D66CB7BCDC709FEB8A0E97ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0x25EF9F7B32E5B3C0C2D7235315C83F44
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0x03E58D321068C1DCCD2A77CCF124242C
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x14E3F8E52C3512593A1D03186EFCDDC3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x5B02F8385426A775ED2FEC87DBE4A142

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x1DBC0F638007D5FD09B166F86E0AC3BD
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x185C9A3BC3557F9B85C6CA4EE3DB13E5
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0x42EC80FA8D87AA920217895745A88AAF
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x69BB3DA216A08BB8B666F1FD3B7C1D8E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0xA8CBDFF7B351A514E820F8C9D2334677
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0x9E832067B93F988811465387C0A46CC8
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0xDDE80CD56E832665671A63DA373C2B85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0xD36AB4165B2E8F23D2F12D0D1027E1D7
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0xBEB1E1B6779AF0CF111D37FC60638D77
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0x7464D232E27DE9B6CF45F41893C057F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0xCD85006ACDDB57076F3A8963F9537E4D
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0xB62979154B42EC78CCA4A4C5EA103BAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x76DFA245531F309952BE42BF193896A8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0x67D9A2E09E0F439469E3A039C6AEF628

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A pit full of fire."
0xA1F2066AF2A23DDC83424876EF5CD02D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x028B0BAB951268458DCE2A461E4FBAAC
ever?"
0x86FBA19F86FBA19F6472AE251EA85DC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir."
0x3B2A0BFA2C5D852D1ABCBDFEB5230EFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0xDA5584F25E1CB1CA334EE68B364EAC36

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0x30A2ABEAE77B41FCA560CE663E2D0D32
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0x7943E72CB85C02B6D71E3E1291DCF837

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0x9CC96093ECAB545F101F411F19456A64
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x71A8C044FB50F096144B4E2ABE769514
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x33E1869F3977B0909C851F66A3D59D28
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x396BEE759C301F0203FCEB43AAAE4276

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x2FC3E8BB4FCBC421E849A22F6F45E941
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xA5D9ACCC40DE4D7E95F4874362C38358
enough away.
0xE75235EA424385C37BD6B40855F1711F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0x6A17842207A1BCB32156B90E193BEE37
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x51D3ED2D53C9A18C30CA41189DDA0F47

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0xD8D4EF51D1E70B9C113DFBBD0A43B541
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0xB2211910F820244C4AAD12441AC495C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x476663DA1107DA8F8BD54009356F3836

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you read your Bible?"
0x7D47B47D24AEC387D53DE5C7E422C97A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sometimes."
0x4F5C217A83FE5C8E0C7F8CB9AE258A04

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0xFBD84A6DFE4F9F8607C75536F5247EC2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0xF0D81E84D104305DE0B886CEFA6D0F2E
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0x5F9C4355CC287AEE1BD51A2DD584A362
and Jonah."
0xD9810DC4FE881830FF26F26C9DBA4106

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x517EF811941BCF39287A1852B883727F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir."
0x3B2A0BFA2C5D852D1ABCBDFEB5230EFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0x3399F02DC49BD63168F52A025FDEA798
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0xF56CFEA5D180F45AC81140DCE2560143
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x822115A0BB5B458DF2AFF5D9AF0CD943
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0xBEB78D60FBBC99CC36824F9DCDC40FA1
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0xD85CEAF1E5E36BCE9A303909EE275E9A
piety."
0xAF05D802AF05D80211DA92C0BA426249

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x329FEC633F019795143E43B54A2047F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x8E826CC20E98A832585F4A2EEBEB61AE
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x561DC187EE30AB6F8FA74431B47301EF
give you a heart of flesh."
0x8778E54527BE5EECFE22B8D5325611B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x086AB82F7F7FC0B97530B7618D740F3F
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0x55AC85973BF64C68F8F375ADBD6047D4
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0xC4CF8B36B48C4B270EAE42C5C312B044
conversation herself.
0xA411879FD6BD9EDF2D99721D87C3E39A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0xD72B272CC55419D20330099696ADE266
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0xCD7BDD4DB0F3BB3CC6F52F88444789F2
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0x108C5C26116B71F65F1044A87CEF3B1E
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0xF2AE97D23F54CB1ED96D299580DED11A
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0xDBA85EA3BF2A41959491AF48943A229E
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xD34B88264BACAD4C711463C311B2F5C3
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xDFCE575ADC43600B91A7483388F97A5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0xF127C0BFFA880CA47C42B5B5E885BEC7
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x12EC7B9B9CB7D4AE1BA915F74BF8E761
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0xFB9C99C982E9B12D749EBC04F13B9E9D
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xC11C7375E13F29966E83D603C1E69F3E
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0xE1F04613A7EA4E6632FB416E90D64CDE
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0xE745C7B65FC6257FB8FC8ED1D9D92FF3
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0x50F6649E043836B1E9F4415D02C302A2
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0x0BA4E7EE56D12BF09C44B6D2BFF140DB
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xFC447A84521B46A28E005240468A4AD4
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0x69612AD2148A2A5E723566F9E7AA168D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x3BA391F109719380408266C7B2425BCB
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0xC379C26669BEA5E194F460A38EFF7961

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0x966E25F49222EA650F31B44F57390C21
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xADC8A0D900B82A17A7FF971DC959CB4F
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x8CA9B58F4BAE4B55F1BA7C0328B695FB
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0x20BDA45E567E39088C2DF69061430718

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0xC61196028114AAEE6912655D29751586
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0xDE21E7C06BA19FC795A54A66CCA3D2FD
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x3DAAAB0A21534EA767A3F7AAB3AE819D
Lowood."
0xB862183B189C507BDFFAF22733CACB36

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0xA3F8EED949481AE8E95F1BE234B3C88B
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0xFB00C10ECE09D22C462B6959A4C23225
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0xB83B57853F14FEECF643B333E440450B
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0xD65A806C0E8C283192C541E6C279845C
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0xACC055E1F5AB2275840890A12FC52B84
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0x402D5A56B0464FF013CF0CB4A9B358BF
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0xFA1BB9C17E18A92111A1829259F132FF
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x1EF8F249D3692858305E2491956A86F0
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0xA6E635104252B3D21090A675002ED288
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0xF0A6E97B913FCCC8B902C47056F3B91C
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x0AF40FF0115E7AF0017C9A9A3944B438
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x4AFBD8CD1AD855642C69467D543BF9AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x69ED76A44D5D35DD4C8CE7A83608726F
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xC9F03D8B92335A7FBA1B852757ED68B6
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x24071B1EF50E7C54E0441F0B172A980E
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0xCC3E75D73CF0A043F0EEAE7CEB6D47A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x83A8964DD24E371CFDBC552E603A41D8
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0x9471E800F25DBD6FAA273565E59A050F
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0x2515D24EF8C238B6A15144C4FDF9B715
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xFE7BA32FA49F0B20F81BDC426ACADF39
inhabitants."

assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was

becoming too irksome."

return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good

friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall

send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there

of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x5859EC6FB3116EC95941681C13C7D189
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0xBB90A16DC508B26DBC1AEE2E6AF84B4E
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0xC439556DA04EF28EEE0A8E24A351FAB3
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0xF6ECC1FBC8A64F51DCEA14A06BE0C65A
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0x129A26EB8D9932D0E91776E7BF3F6E70
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0x1B631DD67D84F3E7F4367B818E112E7A
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x4A35D1CEE8916F41C80BC3E396E90E15
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0xE9771201748BF0A4739B822D2175EB55
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x1178009C3352B23270DB47FDE0D441CA
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0xB237D1A15796840956B16C5F7BD3B1CA
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0xBB5240CC2EB3F1341D09CBFB245330ED
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0xB48FBA0F6638D642239780AF57AC6C47
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0xB530E5FBB91C7A97BD420D86708EB90D
handsome attire.
0xB4068AA6E59C4BE4643A15FAA04BC04E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0x0A8DBB388849B8C10E580FF57B5B83E5
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0xE3A21314184D6FF48D1A8C8D26425BC8
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x7E70B051672E77CFE85713B9375FF9E4
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0x5CEC307478B663286D7AF912B07F58F2
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x87917E5FC541A7C8CE05BFF5478618FE
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0x4EB58BB26632F9BA2BB417C4CC846392
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0xC5DF7E67BDB9A53731B52F9EAD54E44A
fomented now within me.
0x31E0929BA55D7DEB8C430009088FDE7C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0x5AAA74701EC0E240E6788E315571E79E
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0x514025F4DE5A411100052E2F4CA208CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x26175919DBF6607AA7E58471BD0B9BEA
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0xAA0C1C1CD84753398B4071622307B321
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x3F4CCA121771EB18714449326FA03A61
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0x5B39931E885D2388FC5585A32D40CFFF
to her.
0xDA9E86ADDA9E86AD2BFFBB197B1D4CE0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0x62BA6E0A62F0FAF1F330E30F49A94172
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x4E555DEDE1176741F7454BA989C15573
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x18307D9509C3C0D2B74158D8C0409CD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0xE68A01B1599D4070DD236DCC8720BFC3
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x00DEBAAA235723FD72D9FD62EFA0FDFE
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x1E7D4B2E00FEC552EA2DD8E2E948C731
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0xB9564190945A95B5C17AA094DA49BDC9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x718363E98D6E96977DD393F7C5BBD9D7
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x93B6828F17DA6395C7937240CD099635

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xC5F0FB894AE5F2329D7A08D9BF67351E
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0x0F1C3FDC624F3364CFF8D61BE18DBF61
used to a child.
0x1B5F8F0E22A5F0F69C34533DB416EAE1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x5D2F61C9F1953185D965446252A25C62
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0xD2BFE3C865D7268540A269155ED5D6DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x73E13E6EFCB267E0BD70F21437AFECF6
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0xF1C3EEB2087B2C9107715045D99EBA80
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x21DB51C1D1C30C6A08F3042D5BC8CCD8
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0xD5E627F0107859B55D30F0AD94CCEE7B
miserable cruelty."
0x9A13ADE09DF35A57C6AE04567EEC461F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x78DD30B5CF01F5B439F025B579180137

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0x38492B2E062B86995062B8B6E046AD7A
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0xAF2C4F98068F82F91D92A613A66CD802
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x9B9BFBA9E1A5B05D2F03559AD4A98231
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0xD8B260D1905EE64C27566ECD951322E6
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0x56720C8E4BFA87286B4609BBE7DCA72B
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0xA0E53BFFD1DF4F3C3FED723556B2BEF0
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x869CA3C56673904CFEF3796130B9B01A
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xB8C2467940B3B35F909BF2D8932F2831
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x0DC44845BBD4FC89E31E1DF279BAFF72
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x6C90DD871849BAA03ADAB5D63B976370

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xDED7DDC75FAB40316DB874A2507B1860

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0x67B829973D198CEE5AF6E42E877E8EAC
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x7F74131709B3385E62514A8015CB9C25
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x4155FC9BD1DFBFCB2EA11A49AC668B14
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0xAD95D6946E986674062A1B2E8E73ECE4
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x8AC702D5B111F4DAD75BBE36814B7C1B
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x1CCB77924106D9D4230E3EF284AA0CA4
would cry.
0x3CB3972B3E0564F8AC75DB072A3CC8C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x22EE7AE2F06BDC6EBE341CAA118F7E37
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0xF0EC2B4352F3D2EA804C43719ED1A688

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x7CFA8EFC983E3D3010FDCB7815E3E1A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0x99F44182C355099D15C1260BCF1C3CAC
your friend."
0xABAF38D8447826A6194F385CDD2EF72F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0xC2928475E27D1DA90A4C567D3CC9C3E3
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0xD591D7D79685076CFF665E8E7785A4C7
you have done."
0x5E938D7E7483EE3AF712B3AFA5DBE1C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x01848EAF9598C390F43D45E254C1967A
their faults."
0xA2A0D4EA972D837D30DE686EEEC1F39B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x34BA987634ADF793BF03F4F1EACD82AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x36E166B6AC1AA5B397242E589FDA306A
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0x0C64B1DC90464C8ACE8C386A7F6333F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x0D3D353578E0AAEB5F67364499DA7A8F
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0x8425E39C371E4A50B2DE8EDB053875A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x0FF52B6267321B861F20BF9868ECA9CC
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0x1445A3093D0451A47F5DEF02BF3030BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x2D4FDCC712DCED5F633894EA4D4D3583
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0x64151DC384A05B437ADBC90D0F14CF68
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0x888B018B5461A2A3675F6536B64D0532
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0x0420A6083B4F82D5CFACEF5667896B38
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0x25C66F40CC1FD827E097C0F86CEFDEB7
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0x6ACCD1C08EB4EA3DD64D5759B721C162
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x34D06065EBDD874178A0622A90AE870D
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xE2C2BD64EF70ED4D54DF787496D8A665
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x9A162AB3EEEC24FEF47B08255A5AD635
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0xAA22DA1A86D386B2840EE509C6252A3B
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0xF3F9AC36F9B39B719A62821AD1ACDE59
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0x72C4914DF8B5B2E21AC3F0503F3E258B
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x42FE7EB4D1CDC2B91641B41C41682BFE
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x3C927C6D600D05D17EE19B7D854EDED4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0xAED430E16D7B8A68AFAB932C08B3DB18
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0x9A40BC1A9379E0F2E1601D62BCFEFAF5
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0x4E2EABF7EE43FA52256A41B08BA11696
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0xE54454C416EFAA0C0CB9F1DE72B3EA39
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x44986E15D47B6A7715D96BDFB7B00E41
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x4F46B7EF7C172CD9D3D86C800F6E82C3
of my nature.
0x93C71706AAD46F3600306CBE060F4935

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x143F0B2F5A6CE27C46CEE807C6E61CBF
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x11BA1A8F359868D0C169FB95C48D8698
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0x037086789614F2A190E9789D6D4F632D
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x63D69E58545278E19D87050F89543090
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0xFF5CFB7F0CC2865DD1548F9C02822E7B
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0x8782BFAB8C69CD10694594FDDC94840D
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0xDE4EA6ADB1A9359C6ED7606BAE101614
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0xF7F7C355D1243024C617A5F274AE8C70
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0x88146519894EA9097205B90D353CE54A
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0x6CE48E7704F98FE75391DC2107CF56C5
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x8C7DC82C40ECCCE532B0B6272428CA4C
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0x1C6B1E5E12B320250F722FABDBE32705
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x6ACC4DAA95D1F25529C0C34807B7DDAA
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x35326BE2BC1A5B7AF8CA0DDF45691197
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xB2D16D79AC3310D35CC1E3D88AAD6394
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x4E63EE037748469FDAD14AD6D9D8E488
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x34B35D87944A8BC867AC99504F4FD67E
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x1A45B3F5B2204D01664852C66C0D4C0D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xAE8D1B01A3607EDB8C9129186F0F7F38
to lunch!"
0x651895F8A8C25E53221F5FDB4337252E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0x522849D4862F3B0C5296FB45F2E6BCBF
came tripping down the path.
0xEED243CA548B177EC01FA1B61B08B92D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0xA73CB531B117AC5CC6D81B42F9D6902A
called?"
0x150639AC0D36B9C5B6FF918201ADE7E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0xAF4E17F335040294B7BBE8895BB61589
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0x91F3E9B846AAA64011A331F3E96D46AC
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0xE83720191C447E8DDA3C203767081E98
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0xCAFCCEE81299249EC55BCBCAB2611B98
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0x248D7217C67672E0BA66361AE8BF082C
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x8B8AE1C468F3F8E8AE8243FC87E4E35D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x5BDBCAB30A8F1CB983CC6414728FD76D
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0xBB7DC09E6F43D1C22B38E1DD056F71C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0x918992B647B2A8AC5D6FC15631BFC3EB
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x023C55D84B48D3F15918F88B84278EFB
suppose?"
0x71FF8F30B6D078F4A7C950106EB8E9EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I nodded.
0x1C091468E0F74437EFE42AC7A41FBCEA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x06A1258A593F18D02C1EBA80E3CF2969

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x87DCD921BB43ED4DDCCC50458C69733F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xE327CD37C930F8E3547FE95CD8D20541
be bolder."
0xB23EBADE3C20E8C967C9C39DBE584617

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x2E3088EE5F7DB802C5B4D4655A1BD9D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x13ED5AB5088794A971D0E39E5DC9EF39
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0xBAED9402E56354F8D95E5CC3E60CF09B
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x74DC65A11D845999FD0B5B570E78C605
for you."
0xB90EEE6BEB0E94A094E3514FB1A773B4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0x460683BCE195CB3252D4C5C1C6A7FAFB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0x47237560D49814FF9C0F23D86CB4E8A9
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0x4215EC491EFDA80BE2294D34A4943A5D
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0xEB0019D6A8DC95511F2C627B651D2E72
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0x72016C11A776C82B357BC3AA1C52750C
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0xB4699D5495DF6FD1D417827D5C1C7380
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0x898877B1BE4B3DD09BA66B5F30C00A7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x184B052EB34AC815D4D88545580E0983

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0xE0182FF287882009D307BD628A4AD9CC
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0xB1D8BF99A9AE84362FA82924B28CE080
provoking."
0xF293F9D4926E85371EE90155287DD8BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0x3CB22338C1021CC39A47D7CF6410B322
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x1381EC350E5F2666D860A5A0E4BD2506
dread."
0x837062A7837062A76DD6A2C5E871E725

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x1D072B425D5D1D573FFBB97B789FFBE2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"As you do, Bessie?"
0xA4BB20D092ADA17F748E3B6ADE6FB566

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0xFF57C446F804E3BC9BB4338D5FF9A8DF
others."
0x83C5355361A466FB896C7E4935E144EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You don't show it."
0x83D0B34C96456BA2B6B87395A95A3D56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0x74ED8C00E86458B37E035C3498390409
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x419D3B1FA6A4BFEABD57A237FB8189E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0x6BC50A8CE839DBE21859AED49405E62D
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x4C653BB50874A866C4F9CE8B84A71EF5
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0xA33FC2F3E91152D1FC72D31E76C3FCD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x138788253115D7CBA34D7770CBDA732E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x97755B039330B07EA1660D6C8B01EF5A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x17E88AA2FC531AFFD82E4BC25736066D
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x0EDA2D4CF5BE97D9B29AED881180C657
you'd _rather_ not."
0x3C12DE237222A5746C8056A220B69435

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x876A463087B4604784F5876F40D824FF
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0x0DC8BE287ACC1D6C10D4AD487DE46903
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0x14499E1052AD78771056246A1F3F444A
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0x40AA147305A6A95B98D1A930B7D95012
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

CHAPTER V
0x00AF7380E020BC644987B57E5D879ED9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x0D566F8ADEA28E1831EB0BC552762F3D
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0xF5ED3E07C91954493DDABAAAB602D08D
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0xA72586E68BD34B17CE97C66774F6FA7E
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0xA6FB4715B768F9EF858806399689133B
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0x04FCEB5DA4280E718DD1EF05862B895C
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0x88CD793BBD552AD19667BCB8481AA565
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x03CA8B5CA53BF7F62095E18515DC1212
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x066C590BCB4651A1A611062AF77E8598
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0x187B92CE06389CC3C05225A287792CFE
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0x1D379264B06ADD839F6FDD9AA4C871B3
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0xB70F7C9091FE7096F96BE5C4D0D3B4CC
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0xEBAD078928FB214075BFAB1103F4621B
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0x62B37C1CC035996278BFC4497B5C42DD
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0x8B0AA851F077700909FD0E0C3D33D746
bye?"
0xB0C432B7B0C432B765F0CC42F6652E48

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0xF2D8040159A8477127075CE4F81F69C1
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0x110592F53F189BE70ACF79FF58B1C33E
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x41C110EA62F6F3F9AB1F82E3C26EC79B
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x90468A0D5563F4A41B431E8D427518DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What did you say, Miss?"
0x95B1819F2C7B986B332FAB5E1343E08D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0xDF1F9ACA0839E1511492C25CF16D6C47
the wall."
0x1177AFA2485219AA7AB250A98D9D4561

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x98030879112FF8030728F8D4CA669060

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x2327E71C8EAA54D340CBC9B310D60031
been my foe."
0xD7744F26FAAFE9104E2D16C00C530FEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xDBDB528E109E4C946864D151BC09E9BE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xF154D301715D3D3BCEEA264E8C26A9AD
out at the front door.
0x9AF2A9420BE0AB6F3A823412F6F2797D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0xBA39D9DE0D4DC12CCA25F3863AB55ADD
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0x4550B4A3B28F0EF3F3444885E7D6E791
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x4C33B3988263B29C8A010FA93D80AE87
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0xEE6D8FE0B67E38FE8E5CA219FF751B15
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x9F069E1E6B7F556CC07B96DB5807EAFB
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0xE3FDA581817A0917918B6EAB4E424BF3
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xEA8053D166F3B0078E7B24178E109A93
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xD98696551262E036AD4371EBB901BE7D
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x37876C56B5B8843728EC29256555496A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0x32F3937D5ED18FEEEC52F3AD150AE664

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And how far is it?"
0x6FD209E0E00166BD8B4451AE82170748

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fifty miles."
0xF2C3619753023407E0D77AFA61C5FEEA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0x9D0EDB15F7E667E519B3B88084AB22D6
alone."
0xA33BB091A33BB091C9209EB692E47E7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0xBE7A60CC0E93CB2FA409CBFA712AA771
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x54EB1FAF20A0A972B13E35B67CBE14C8
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0x757D1F6025FBD887408AE0D703265C63
with kisses.
0x9365DF50D384CDD8D0245DAC034157C8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x3B7098C54D75259DE700FFB7970688D8
me into the inside.
0x94BBB151553CC369CC73B6BDA4873011

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xB9F1B83492A44A9CDD69C8939CE59453
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0x8D9143A83FC6EB6162666434A2B7AA04
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0x2945DC336BBE09F24CE69DE5542F0251
mysterious regions.
0x52E329A21CC2A043785F183E2C11AE88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0x3DB584035C650476936F1862F13690AB
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x0D607E0B0B7F67672D5D3AD08BBFD9DD
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x46B992F945E7AC4F67DE01C19635BB7A
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0x8840DBBD597417A6B876966B5E432677
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0x3C2B4F7CDAC0367A824576D849EB9A8D
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0xB5B1EF20D17D026D03236C931680944A
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0xAB821340E5D9136FD4DE51582D2F9D06
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0x131406A323D17779C01A9CAC86A9F6B1
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0xA8F5A9FBC9D49F098DC3C2BBEDED5B24
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0xE7CD099617783FAF9042BF57B67714F4
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0xD72E008AC886B769D657E652ECBCEE36
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0xE681408876F5EAA9E4C4A371DD46E5A3
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0x72EF270CB68E05059C1B778615E1E67F
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xCB23BD7FA781CB95E0FB4C3BA99B3283
"stony street" of L-.
0xC266BE1D2D8D90C8A5C5F6F53EB31C82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x10B9BFEE0CAB3CD8736FB461167EE910
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0xE0A409C47BCB954F729E8CDAB696FCF0
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x6391136AD4607631B162FD74A050B3D8
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0xCB18405CEA7A1D09CEEC15B34C922B4F
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x5EDB468E81526E95E342263F647C56F3
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0x4ADF291B570AB841697B063563D9A46D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0xBF775E0BD847919FB5EFC20232EE433B
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0xE4EAF7CB32682C01A5DCC55452073225
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0x687183CCF50D5E2BDA9C937836B1926A
by the light of the lamps.
0x49D8F0BE5CA75F8E3200435E4B783870

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0x528AFEA0D591EB01B60C2216D8A86FDF
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x4BDBC139E33D3D5A0E2099A7D4F1B353
instantly drove away.
0x031B0838642FD833DC9E911878D2BC97

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x63325DB88300ED435F74433F8D5524AE
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x682F5D2119F1CC58E81CC67512E59DAC
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0xFD54D78F0FC7482CBA2034363D6B3D34
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0xBF550563E3742CAB0B1A66AE23264412
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x706D36EED49235CD2EDDB4414572DB49
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x1B4BFA49A8ADE3BF55727505FCBA8FC6
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xCA2B94BA44560E929AFED7B262892F75
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0x4FCFE72A77E822209A5E5E27EC14E135
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0xDA689E8862D718F227FAEA9FF6CAB34B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0xE3175CD934C72806E4B70C00846C75AA
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0x4A5DDC756651BDF7194005E0E8ABA68E
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0x4C74B7B87DCB421F699534FA016215E4
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0xA3F6CCB6BA555EA20C5128AAE92A0DB4
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0xBF06BF27644ABCB5FD4B8B1C9D40D16F
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0xC9DEC3D45831062641E133FC9BA58BD2
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0xA3184E405CDECF9572B773E239E88934

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xA6523047EA41E35DBFD1ADE9E9F1071D
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0x89FD9EE9E78F38A14EB88C240768668F
grave, her bearing erect.
0x5FE2E21F6EF8FB292873BE9DE9D0684C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x0F9A002314D0CDB0FF961158E139DA19
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0x39A684BF9BC5E88D21C0E6A0210CEAC0
then further added--
0xD42699BE05EE216DF7DDB50FBC9B353D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0x48DA1690B5C15CF2F426972DAFAEBBA2
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x6DC9178466F2536C7154243BA3D75B85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A little, ma'am."
0x1C1C60C0891083CFFBBFB6DC7ACE1BD3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0xA33DFA7E929F62F5409B11AB0A5F6288
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0x6AD65CF64B921016760E2B79D5BA8AC9
come to school, my little girl?"
0x8AAB1A48DE81974A499DEAD6E35BFD7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x1EAF76B77A4C969AA0E830D4E8A4A260
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x784FCF1B0073ECAFE86AD7C7A6CEBD7E
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0xDCE7F00657ECF4CCFD92F7C39F39BB4C
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0xFAA5D78296B570EE28646616C1F020FD
me along with Miss Miller.
0x752A25F3F99B9D92A44C9B34F923CB29

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0x6623713FBB4DF068C0D6947D3B03FD4B
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0x2CBF1C91792422E00A642142C0A06F47
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0xF5E00FE8A0C574AC967276E8811DB285
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0xFE4BE9DBC4A1F931BB70E356111A6E22
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x471F7A9275D7AA7AB5CC36A521C0302B
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0x42EA3129E61702A34CCBE04FF5474AC6
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x0C16E5312E02300D574B927835EC885B
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x441AF9C76D41ED71D7F27DAF0EC360A0
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x5D51400D3286D018427A498D7FE12C52
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x5310BF8129CB220E6B2B32168E22238D
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x97D83CD42A7F04529294E5CD02DCA360
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x20674E0CA18E8E20AC95675866F8D27B
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0xDEE474EF85F63DCAA35C232D441A1BCF
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0x8B70D8A316556CDBF8698E3E48CF446D
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x2C349FCCB71D9FF7490C3AE0B7EB9FD0
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x8FC4389FC0457A6979A767F09F3266AE
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x9F396C4FC5F47644D2508E3724C5AF08
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0xDAD7C5504B7443111EBD59D39062599C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x042CBAA4B87E493A1183CCA3F54B168A
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0x46696D571E12E3DA539F9EF84A2701CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0x71C4B6F7EC7752F9F9E78B9E4E09C34B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xE1D61EF9EB2AC3233C6B62FEDEC4B719
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x946AAD5B8F6E43DCC11F12D80CE44F83

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0x987E8B23CD990DA35D39C9247866CD40

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x3F3ED0047E96D5A19E68FA585D64A165
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0xE71BD44E84F1F3B4D6A23C516E4ADF31
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0xA6AC2DFABC9B46D5DBF21D701192EE0F
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0xA21623E97495CA78FB710A3F262F7377
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x161650CB1E974948C05F473877E9D340
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x1AD4A5FF35BF06FC162FC07F37080986
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0xFBA946D338A76B8B5B8A73137F65A711

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x40065C2B58ED262D2B4EF992DB3B6982
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0xB6DDBA1F11D402EF2FC4F2B2481E8248
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0xD61DAA2B95DF3C22493D661520B1F967
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0xC6450EBE4055EE2D4F48BFA9DC88D91A
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0xC03923D95CA00DB68D96A9AF8C5D976A
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0xC3097F718B89AD4B606921E5BEC8F517
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x0AB3F226EFFEA075C05F993ACE3517CA
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0x37B93A90C88A0F76251DEB186144E4A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0x41E5E80C4AC05ABC44A12B1997E11757
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x8F588ED31B174FD85A75B80343058164
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0xC4B5F0A211E27E38CCD677EB731C3FE7
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x2805F9306AF5DDEA5260B40127A9D9EB
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0xE579287D3098EDB6090950A508BDA01B
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0x4E07EE63921AC76037492BAA63A33DC8
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0x342C1C4928D8A1055203C4D6A9348FBB
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x2A96A912951588B682BA02F197667D33
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x0AAAE75A1103D3FAE5A87C38B2F3F3FF
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x88488A1293BF94B6E38F570ED795C39D
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x7A4D2CB698AC33B8B0A4575B7187A64E
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x4D2BC3067C433FC3D1ECB835856484F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Form classes!"
0x01FA15629819AE20197A0F167DDC98AD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x6BE20B981A92AEA6458432AEE836437B
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x4DA5E3BEE6D2B763D9B399C729E2D4D3
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0x0235D4F2BAB66F14AE64F553CD8EC931
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xA9C42C242F3BB198A7D82090C6970BCA
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0x34E2263F167A454D22B8F838A6BFB52C
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0x3862FF7341B7740589589BAA8576B37B
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x990AB7C44368E92D796FB324A0F13E71

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0xEA444D0FDF238FC762F29319875CB269
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x9D93D0ED24AF7C0A985ADE331D651639
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0x7F670C5B4289233B5E76334A62BC3DD5
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0x1256D171F652BD957D9AECCAFB071896
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0xA52B01CDBA511C0F2AB53CECF21084FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0x0A2B9661A1BC71156C523B3C2D977E29
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0xC782D5EDF25716CB8078EA485D274DB3
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0xAC4DFC5D1BFA34AD2082F3354648A557
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0xC66AFE3987EBF595747F795E7B767381
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0x9F508DC671666AC441CF29521BFD2F2A
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xAAFDCC302A0B3BFCF66BDAAA045B26A4
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0xA03DB3377D10FAA39147C66B4CFE4D67
little the day before.
0x1CC03942D3780082E62A3ECDDE2EEA3F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0x2DB1794B02774A4D0113DD786FFDFFF0
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0xEE72306A7DC3D2B7D7C81A7FB48F32AA
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xBAB82C6CA27E44ED9A35E99BECE51EE1
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0x955F2760139674283BB0DD4219DEDD13
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0x4C2ED4E266C39B7E4B1619D29F2C9F52
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0xB24018906B297C5A91A585133DC1BC2A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0x18CDEDB112D0F1319E5AB5A73C340740

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x5A322A61E81B88D5C4967E5D3E8AA39B
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0xD85997A2DBD6E7D6326B07825707874C
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xCBF75FC68955A05678845E773420F5F8
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0x0B7D3C3238FC130D3D298E802D79772F
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x1914C6D6AA54A47F348AC3C295AB9623
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x15CB72F4FC0BBDB0A34F713333F29D28
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x8E66C3513BD5825A2CB22D6EC1A71647
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0xAA1A7FE6768AAAADE7E7C70452B387E8
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0x3669AEB265FCA29F5F5C8DF133CE1557
the meal began.
0xBDF10AA42B4EBC4B35B0DD6C5537DADD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xBA9CB3CA2344C2261DB4DDE5E9725A38
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0xE812CB0CDD81C28BA271E0303BA9F3ED
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x28EBE4880A99A397A2A63E7596C6A599
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x46B174F00662F83DD74964E9D5526222
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0xB359464B66528D522FC2BED3FB7DE9E4
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x4A0135AAC24E624F2D209E82CD6B326D
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0x6E8987713DFD1AE19C175DF3A6E6FDA5
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0xE71C00BCBEB99B6023A1E4B51EF18CC1
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xF467716F3BB36535A80A89E7C9833B8A
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x7F6F3A23B85EAB88449D52DD0F1FC950
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x563A584E1ADF7B5697AFBB30F59396E7
them, the stout one, whispered--
0xC509F3CBA19183358DE7171ED43770A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x2049C0027483EE69C2CB06A78BF3F953

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x0C3F3B751F808F51EEA9B7A6EAC8394B
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0xD8B9E4B6834E1F24F8C778D3BB0445B6
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xC95B04FA576AF705F1C7E5EF01226A58
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0x3698DC29494C4C0D826984BDA0C9E00E
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0x0605B7B6FF649EE191A70FEF4D105A01
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x2A42271FEB09F3E7FED4073BAB5E7283
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0x3645AEC11677806CF61EA31BD699159A
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0x343BC08FFE20A4F1B858C5ABF8BED4A2
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x51F72E4B39D190DDB89C5AD4FC5D96D7
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x367035F549612C41CF8A863FB74F8B4B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0x9512DEF1320ABEB12D8ACB361D68D1EF
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0x40A1189E6D0FA92715B9D9A1069C4568

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0x38983ED28B0797E80186FF29555B67E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0x0291A8684DBBB8C8715C610E8E5D0833
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x84A62733902BC94A7371E1451B4EF663
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0xD96EF73B7ADC35DBB9B7CB9829603E29
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x16D4D8FC64874A699333850EF478486A
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0x6F73E90FB78378439EAC411C8C7BC421
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0x2AC9550C0818AAC357A6F659E10DC750
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0xCD775EA695503CAA8013074CD7AD56BB
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x1805FF250064283B31AC42CBDC9B5657
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x3E28B4F280049AC7297CB1AC8B41DFEB
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0x4E6D474584D3FC67679A378EDF469F76
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x75C912AF794A3D213BE71172462B1EBB
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xB3432AFB2B6395E2C135D272556F9627
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x9C88BAB3F1925F47639676A4E0D42126

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x0AF2EA35FD39710E1E9F3808A5919D57
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0x9839425A1B8A4EF1A54F7B277A9AEB1E
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x485762F97664229283DBFDE1068A5DAF
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0xBD2EAA25DB3FCF5B3D3080623D2D36FE
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0xAC162B9CA2E000AD8ED28DF62ACF07CE
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x0E6FC1E6B488795C465C2B58DD04D507

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x64AD2A43B8518B7B12F00F5FFFE471BC
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x75FA03C1399587348C35007A9A841E9B
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x0F4E2B79A213C16E2FB081DC7FECA26F
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x71580C1BC8A8DCBD5119BC2B9E9E29DF
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x75D909ABB5F388BF5DB78CF048861159
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0xA6A3BC5A1EF0698026A2C21958C74AB4
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x13F5CE639F0280CEE931DEE3303C1611
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x2B63A7C72F3C2B5E378D33B21E0A5B58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0xFC6241C5B76C00F67AACDAD98DA7F0DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0xC262ECA7AD8B88D620189CE1CA18E8C6
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0x0320E8C80240A0960213D4EF7C165E4C
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x1BC6BD50C6606EFEC26D4ACA58B50DC3
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0xB91F48BB6D1DB3AC3C6CA9E8A25B4B0E
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x2A39E94DEA64610951C47EC40CDA1E96
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0x2E0133D7E3ED1AE7D8C497A997913B06
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0xBE6F6F8E708DEDCE76C5E569E50CC750
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x1232B5871EF1843328A7626E701F4513
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0x20C65C98BEBB77E327714F1D0D371DBA
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x82CCA29DDEE5E37696F56A40CEB6F14D
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x436E2F4D2AD7B89BB81799EC793399E6
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xD0D32CBA08ED0085B69E31626382591A
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xB0C8BDB68DEF194E94BF417021A02143
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0xFD6DA2DCFEBCA9B8164C577C5311E760
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x27540465B7791443FEB2A51C535A7912
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0x3FA1C162F5D42F2FF3E2E22B01753077

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0xDA2C3EA2B0C60003227AADA0112E1F94
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0xCBC09E27D79F812B43CD77FD61307DCE
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x9353892FCCBCD055FB2579D4EB48817D
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x32DC663B7EB645A36A24A6EA97A1FC59
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x7C29A76E6A2FACB11EA47D0EDA5B8B32
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x54A282E71DBC631F073AD55DA19B088C
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0x33FED8B1A6035F06FD1BE1AD6747E697
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0xEE802CC9425849DEEE436BC634E1C087

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0xE8AACF807825AD9FA2ABA25977951E70

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0xDA93B0B379C79CB68B2E77DF54D92C60
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0xA6C77E986FBC8AA8B4624A0A14B5398B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0xF77D0F9511F46399C7BF5503311C6419
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0xD0C96ABC3384C19356E39637058D647C
to all."
0xEE883FA1348669D65F71CA31F8400EA0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x7BCD443702F296236C4BE477FAC992B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x67310DD6FEABF339E0A1D544EC7C9FD8
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0xE203B3A006BE515652E42F6F2B13BDE0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0xBCFF9349A192147B21919F428994EA6E
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0x3BE048AAF10D4500A600F4A138D6550C
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0x7AAC54D12B018EE54935156E9A5087B0
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x39823B2AF45259EAB9D4DF55999734FB
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x7B0E8346309603B7ECA1D30DC005D5B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x8015E87864D3DD4AF70FD16B9EA1B4B1
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0x731CD9B080E1CA4E3D8561712693B462
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0xA87B8CFFCEB691404EC16CE671A3DBD0
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x238078DA3C655F0334845AC9F1776CA2
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0x842DE91FDE21E1A8A267EB26BFC0A8BA
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0xC5049A02941DE55146703765F275C1E0
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0xA701C71161C261C97159A99653A7454B
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0x9FC129CE22CCC64A418A8133FA676CC4
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0xFEBC272284460517EA9A48214F8C2FEB
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0xEB5888128A28D90EECB5978F14D80F85
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0x9C2CD8E955CF81D76DBF11D54223898C
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0xCBE8F6071E6A8C474E9DDA47BC06F51D
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0xE43E55A6FF8F1D2C7483A28D03F0FB2D
hollow cough.
0xED8970E974A4FABD6DB758B813BAE2E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x7BE12A9148B3E2C11A3A190596E630D9
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0xA2232405734928F103CED9A1741E8678
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x92A88897DA87277A6CEE4E705434CA7D
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xB9BBEFE4CE98838C9A8D48986C6479CD
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0x6F550EE7BA4308677D3C705D3F689180
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0xF8F65BF4835C27EBA31A9FE7972517F2
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0x47C5842E31AD90072FD473A773C664B4
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x16ACC96D924AD1248449769F5EDA3CD0
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0x2F0ABF06902B7735BD96023B61AC25BF
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0xED58F1F2D1F5C3905E3B0FDC8795EA45
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
0x8876C1EEFEF860A444CAAD1BF58592B6
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0xEA36C100788E4F3B20B709244607E7FD
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0xA63F4A8C630843C573DF45492F9209CE
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xAD17C44C1A5BC06BF7C859B7ED08E5DE
this inscription:--
0xB91B75D09500F0975A4FC45963748482

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xA8AD83DF8D60C10D93DF3B8C98B96393
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0x4549E46A7AB663C2556BDC41B39210A3
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
0xA3AD023CE660F0D3ACC833724B3198F9
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
0xE0C711490602F43786D069809AC469BD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0xF774B7883ED0F42E729E581545555D8A
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0xFBD9F5A32597C333F82D4B244653CEB7
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x20C12CE0BBF4069B389CDA65CE27B8BC
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0x229A143E7B053FB7E4A8E31B6B9AA828
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0xEF7015A35A18703149E3A6AF7FFD02AB
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0xBA721E865C461AC4DFF3B773317D541E
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0xC06C793CF9ED17D31ABAE9F4FE01D0BF
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0x3C7EB960E4F65D412A9A0514EF48FDC1
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0x9CBE02EA75B27E1B4B36632F87F61A4D
I said to her directly--
0xC8C640F15C450DCB41C71A47C96BD08D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0xF1352B24E8CAAA95BFFAD8291857DAD3
her to lend it to me some day.
0x7089C9D37787EE5243BFE6843FE29368

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0xF71B31237C827682A541CAA1156A865B
she examined me.
0xF8301D9722B281C7F3627ADEC4212507

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x82D64BB3EB810D60C34BBCBC46F1488D
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x75FD9B3735B06B089E411754233D1829
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0x1544B94ECE7E5F203CA7AD97F3314B63
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x1AEDC48EA0E99E8A9129BA3431E8FF07
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0xE281589364882E89906F8818E9A6945A
or substantial.
0x254E184B77E4435A4899A0EC24393305

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0x72E5901979839E725689DD03167D2FF9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0xBF2B91534C525A161039CFCAD6163082
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x96F5EF4F1E64AE41651ED54740861B5A
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0xABB4B88C599853252B74A06721EA5EF5
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x899C0FC17B760F0D1D5EA03DD29CD9CB
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0x3CFE5961B8002A89AE9EA5A7CDF7010C
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0x14F533856AD5FFD1167508C7EB984044

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
0xB6AF8B754ED8C9A7620D75E0764DBAE6
is Lowood Institution?"
0xF000EF2285853AA63227666C7594D30B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This house where you are come to live."
0xFFD49D2829E83857D6019FA67C56DF38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
0x56562F0DDD304B1FF23DEB0AFBAE365E
other schools?"
0x478EB428238599C259730F588720D7B7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
0x0709CD6265E1C0C45F40BE125F273C6E
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
0x494899924E3B7FC4F753AE737604DE09
father or your mother dead?"
0x02A5EAE86B6D27CBD50099A79D9DFE77

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Both died before I can remember."

"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0xD935C9CDEA722F48AD887FC89BDF97CC
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0x502020E88F8E9C7EB970F29A7D580DB5
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0x05E2D7B62542682109D922A645DFDFAD
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0xD428D2B393A8ECF83D35AB86E198C205
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x4E8CE1691E48FB722BF4C055E7F82BB8
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xF1E03A7B4A68E6DE11158EF436A01B7B
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0xA54849B7B144E1660C7E597221E6F192
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x79FD45A4D761E77BF8B406F97E9D75FC
day's fare would be like this.
0xA3B96C23BF02E1D44D8747CB536F24C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x24A052F82B7BE54AD54D6118414B8F8D
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x785F4309D76B4C434D6E60F1DA313D3B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x83CDAE02B7326C8FCC19D60B6F7F0FB7
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0xF3E5DCD55261E681885D2C89C4460170
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0xA20057B8B6EF98F3D68B85EA2FF33D3A
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x8E3EA8405293DEB0DFC11DC99A6B7EB5
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0xC1FFDAF05C55478A23EF398D60B17EDA
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0xC81DCD9C1B290835E9505152404AA031
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x995E6898B0809A0C57AEE95EABD35C78
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0x5D9C2FF0D7047E860025086E0AC8C8FA
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x98D0C79FD4977AE700319B69B924AF9B
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0xCD24D11FE70B2724AC4C1D0460DD0F0F
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x82A355E446A301F0FA87E8DE9408F9EC
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x3AB9BA85E6FEDB90CB6F358763C92A57
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xD1A770D84A8709CEA78C1C007A86DAD2
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x61DE1019E9E064FA367F4BC37953DCEF
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x908A166C8DBDB7303A72F0DC1C2EFC2F
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0x36539ABE940ADE1176E550DAB08D9E64

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0x78ECD9805958BBBE8C466164F8217E12
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0xC8143F07AD740B1CE27B50EDFC884541
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0xE590505E4F7FCB77997FB4DFD6498634
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x56A46E5A7322F54E95575D1047047D41
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0xB801CA18B7D1401FBAA83714512E52C3
first day at Lowood.

CHAPTER VI

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
0xC6B2C3D0093109536E21A0C55ABAA7BC
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xA902081A4B85E3D414E9CD79444E95C4
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0xBDAB8635C4C5C3CAE397E4596DCC13E5
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0x44676EF395C5B10B4655CEFADFD5BDAF
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x1895DE6C4C3782515E54DBDC9F2F09F8
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xDCFB66469FA57E094EDF7D807A5B64B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x025A27336EF4BF3177C90B3DD67684C9
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x2B66F08D151FC4571DB87BF884F4B359
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0xD559499CEBAEAB9F0A0358C1380BC2AB
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x79244D98C61E8145F5A6A774EE0C5169

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x242A4E410D87ED84EFE60172CF6FA5CF
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0xEFC39DD5718589AB48915EBE53C13B7B
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x1C81A568C2EEB0C63AE72DAAF6B8536D
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0xE1D8B543CB13C57CE35A4FADF3032808
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x79E8DB77A844A3385869A2E4BBC51485
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0xC9AA576E6F2D2F38C8F5CBD3611FF40A
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x8FC93CA3473C3F98C7DF22CB6EFC64D1
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x1B6D3027CF1FAFAAF18B3222B59D3F22
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0xB07FFDDACAE9EBA2285AC049234AB613
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0xDBD26A9CF6C3F6BF6A9D7189793D09B7
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0x51DC7DAF3463C5DA15CCD769D9161114
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x4E54B96D78E567F60E9B59504A5D2D43
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xC2E264E522382914ED74B28BFFBFB4C6
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x946319F9CBCD5D792B0FDC441479E7BA
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0x1EEAD6E7F6FE8D2EF2FD2B1FDD45D49C
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0xEB00FE74CF0972051B324833F3A1AB20
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0x98B20C0EDEDE0139C29B7A067E46B50D
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0x3B034DE800C225620395F308BE58334F
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x47E76F39E0A4E6970DC7338F252394D7
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x39FBBC0754573A7442E158184DA622A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0x4FF99780935CB318CA66B689AFEBC3E8
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0x3F9DC81A3D5F307599F2C75940B4F9A8
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x9920B8ECC7DF1DE8D6DBB3DE40F13444
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x375F687104C15125AA52D960E76612B2
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x04C15AE95F99074E501972688BA1E11F
&c. &c.
0xDD345B98DD345B9848EA490EC52C68E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x8C7550C7B2E442AB99B073A01D8D74D4
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0x664380AF8A5510DDD64FC3703062423D
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xF0208850D50012F7D729A3FD91560AE3
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xA8F25500668AC6EAD34C6C2722CFE396
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0x82E82D4543166F4504455E55B62C78EC
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xF398BC8D9DCA79A58FB3CA0939612C00
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0xA3CA315FCEEDC5EFDD5D01754E0D977F
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x94D55021767CA3A1AE30D94FB40E7813

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0x7BAFB260C5BA312AF47C80C1C24AEA71
morning!"
0x74325280EB9C4A527319009E397816F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x17225F5BEF0903573ABD72C9C0E0BE45
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x011CE9E846BF7C5DD13D40CC8AE0FA99
as the water was frozen?"
0x39906BE80150EC35423D9156925F8695

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0x03ECF77B38B329A7DAED2B9AD084FB9E
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0xBE24D8E100EBD7200057C6D38055881F
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xAB50BA6B5202DE594798C4AD5264DAAD
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0x15143535CFE69F33633706DF07A056B3
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x73C1775AE92410E69243BECDA52EE742
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the

import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0xE9D956F406DB9545F00687791AE15DFC
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0xB2F5B12E5AE3BC6C33CE28E413AF387B
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0xFB286636184F244DA55354FA4E08072F
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0xF51AF3507AFB6E66F4CFC1F8E2CE74B4
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0x826DD24325B7D8B41695365BF665B95A
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0x98F767EE6E6A7E2C51DD67A5406F6110
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x7FD0670AFADBDCB8AE55C2A279EE7A25
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x9698AC7E09416ADD0597290ABC213A1E
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0x4D383C3CA94B332351416E957C8578B8
altered its ordinary expression.
0x83EB8D5890FF4A9676EB323D920545DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0xCB1323F122F15CD585C8A5C7EA8D5ED2
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x27BCEFEF917E4E24E7DB041443B015F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x708920B6D00B19D5EC1EF24B23BF64C2
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0x3961CA7BA295C02B2F64B086D26E51C0
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0xE5F8A8479DB1D0A9A240201AE49CC2D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0xF78C46B9437B600ECC207581D411B080
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0x90B72A04C00ABF5B4E6941F01DFDAF63
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0xD2F30883A4038F0ED3BEEDC87AC0D6F9
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0x06AD667F3C186E228AEE9E0237CA8663
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0x9C408B3C8C2F597479436D849AFAC2B2
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x8DE89B8599C4EE49A6ACF6BA4A6561F7
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x61A9A772173A34EF3A1071335995FE9C
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0x1813079532782191C09C424A8FF851DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x9AE0E9C3065F8F080546765E6B982C76
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x63D4A1349F08BCB5802C3482A1E03DF0
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xCBA7C6F680FEC2ADB4D782AF73096E7B
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x73C713C99B75053AA9B28FD135C84DB1
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x78D367607413B7F6ADB8ABFE5456EB2F
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0xBFD83CBD06CF05E088AE87C9B4768047
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x762739025AB85ADD086C0BE37EAF281B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0xEB94AF9BD8FF4E481AF7B91828DB6848
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0x834FD368F865E7F9DD5B6FF7792518C0
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0x716188CF4A0B5F6A7CFB49677C945682
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x6A29638719BB56C38D613CA02E6DCFAA
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0xAFE39D5F3345D17CB540F0D18D134862
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0xB91B9A3F9B31E5D0AA3885135FD420EC
to clamour.
0xC203CF4E147A248520DCE89F65C0987F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0xDB4D901FD326BAC610544CA10DBAC833
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x6BC15832E81ED125B96327DE000F1286
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0x7632B79A71EBB3DA0AA3D355F15E1D6F
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0x8524ED042C59C14D9197656E0D7D9A90

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0xC686E910538CC1CD272398D22FAF2C26

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0xD3823DE7EF353FA83690E9A5032CD8D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0xE0DF7297B0B2E640DCA7466034D83F8A
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x8E4D757E9634DDEC1DB9F43A26FAFC21
floor.
0xDF9CC46EDF9CC46E718A96D7114A7CE7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0xA8544B8966EF55C7FE95F8BA078586FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Helen."
0x15BEE6A2FAD8AA86CBB2398CD9065B07

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0xA4E97E4E56D84664527778193CDEF2DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0x1A829D89D7629777012B99163CF54FA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you ever go back?"
0x470E546136DD250641EC278C5094E2A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0xD98882C100D3F5D235D924B14F2249FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0x170C4DD9FF60FB3A41029BB1EFCDE1D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0x42C60A32C3D6711EEEA12BAB252B6748
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0xEB7C97E39CB9AA785BF105D7D8A5C60D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x94F940CCE8434281D652651FDD2D5A69

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x20B836FE87FA1E163B042722E29DEE2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x838356FBCD4AD47757399C575E149768
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x310950034694AF61A1596EE06EDF4B36
break it under her nose."
0x2F3F598452752DC2363DFC89DDAD78BD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x3BDB5D656F80BC3FD2DA032369B9C80A
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0xE1CA5E12156086AC58129EB6BB872D55
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x4E69A84879FF6E29C1E5E26D08192C35
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x9CA3117E8D801C3711A384D40029CB02
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x2DD210A9A0B42D8F098947C458D0C595
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0xEFDE3C520D35B333FF893562BD1A44B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0xCA4D620FB71AFC1CA0EE33241574DF11
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xF744FD1A4BD9673A358035D42B02B2A1
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0x55267B601130279A22758009B46E0B05

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x56D3BAA27586AEBA2B191676043A3D5A
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x5E80112792539C0F543E9912B52EED75
required to bear."
0x27E66C37F764076151A097C491BE939E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xD949A02DC9C0D67FA65040B257A0BF96
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x634D295A86309A341BC7AEB71BA8CC94
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x959110ABB39C0D5FC529F5B8F59CEC0C
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0xA2E162450D8DD93CBE63B316FD22B49A
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x4D8484B555172535D7CEEF3F1275FF5C
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0x9242B2B5E185964D6FBF7D631C33258F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
0x02BA79A547E0E1C07A6A3E4C3DF8FD58
good."
0x421B1C77421B1C7708C60BAF2E0B7433

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0x708BD1075DC6DA3F0C97CE4B3BE09FFA
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0x4814A7DB9939DDD689E20A3ED0736CF8
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xB4C319485AD4FA8CA908E576F7DDB118
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x14615985B2E1E456C73B0F6B205CE76D
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
0x6DF61C6738EFF888FDD60FF786F673C9
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
0xB1EB3A195212939D05BC566AF86C501E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
0x95347C4270E1DFEABA42E16AC6104DE1
addition: she kept silence.
0xA72A5300D2AC433EBFAD88E105D24054

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
0xDEEC42537DD0090CCA2763E43C46AD8A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0x94F876CDD7F7B4C20BBF7DC0140B8728
grave face.
0x5A13F9F6840BA29835195CBAE236C00B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x70A5C6104FBB3855A68267F52EF39E5F
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0x88C9A387AD815D04AC3CF10A447455C7
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x8088A184D1CFE834E4F429324B8093A6
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0xB25264E2433CC6FD62BF2022451C79EA
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0xCF610DBE544C0C811F99E656443462E8
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x496565467A4C9C65C4975554EBFDD40C
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
0x0EA6C249B465CDC052160E0A8EC7CE0D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
0x0DD226DA7CEE4773C22B7ED3C7DA663D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
0xB812607AB8388D582196F89CC813E927
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
0xAD01232E4D4FF15B6EDACFD52B1FB8D2
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0xCE3AD2D06ACABB08F03F4DA9975CFFA9
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
0x13C9BE97B2C92F5950F67238DF3C9F44
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0xD3318B86C5190FCB52F38160B97571BE
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x0E44199327ADC16A35D054575317B424
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0x89F1EED4F4452AA93246C2BB96922998
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x0774607AF3F3247D266CB30BEBB9D9E6
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0xDBE1E8A2F2E9666B9DF94F95F219DDE5
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
0x700B264E67C5AD06D2312FA2317A6AEB
answer ready."
0x1212A70CDC7136684963FDB3141ACD86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
0x754A02A1F5E47661A24004ED2C535D58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0x53ED43B27FA5516E2B43C68F8727B401
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0x362AF181B4BF3C1C4A1664AA8346E462
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x0245237D091B1BA955081308B0199C3B
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x56535E6D69BFA4C2C5178E1DC5CB774B
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0x285CCE2AD4692029D8E9B27818801808
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x73EF8B20F74CEF815878055F017AE7BA
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0x634A21991009736D5B80E80E010B6142
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x55D1DB5E81924CFBCDF5B5D86F973040
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
0x729D668F75ACF845CF7CF8F6D6104486
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
0x8499195CEE3E7D24C68A3DD7E10D600C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
0xE2D17451217D228C2822137C3C3BB399
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
0x4ABEC7441E008CD160ED2FB616411510
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
0x34E30E328A9E12ADF00167B77F1BBEFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
0xFC30DDB0DAD96341DFE2D3546B5734CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0xC21073405D259B70CEBD62772039487A
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0xFFE4BE0716B31E45844F7C1D1FC28CB6
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0xFB08CFAA0F30C4E0C85CC9A4AE608FCE
I wished to gain."
0x59E9D4C6EB7EC14D3AD595A401E7166E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
0xEB41F10FABB14228ED34FB7E62CC8B22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
0x803A23A7B2A3992FDA8C79A1CDEB2409
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
0xB6DE014A6898775909921D40D3A68783

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x34B48F0C3F91501550E782B2735968E2
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x850DC4424A4EFEFD109F4AFDD7BB10BA
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x7F9C8BF90F6831B7505ADE8657221E85
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0x825DDF94D4BF54723F67F19F6DA90057
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0xE7617B2FD956AEE0BB37E1B982931AF2
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
0x7A0BA33F200A487FE14A17837C1DE1F7
person who struck us never to do it again."
0xD8DE34BFCB645ACFBA54530F48D26EA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are

unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me

to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.

cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x9DE83783758F684A0FB5A95A200F2D40
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0xE83A18BA5F06E9A900FE04BEC3C6BCBB
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0xB9240C9CC6BFCC57206B1FE13B1F70E6
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0x7C38BC86F6E341947A5AE7E05F7D9699
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xBD6EFAE50F6DB18C21866AC8D7EB633E
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0xA996FF1F60AC848DE56C9147D53CF3C8
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0x175838F0C55FB40BF5033F6D7FEC4E23
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x40D40C696F33CE23A98D7EE201C9497A
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0xB42FDC83CC1D09C3206794AC4FD49517
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x6654DC6AA5565EAA4951C72619E26752
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0xAD78B4289E6EA7176018D2D0E577F18C
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x68D895E077CF7E9D8FD1B4B56502D56F
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x81A2E88AAD708EE33E02D19EA3DDA6A1
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x118A040626391DC76618092E68B02E5A
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0xF1D026CADB272F76778B85A05C10C860
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0x8FB85E2D9A57FD4062994B3759EDF822
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x4E693F65AFC4C57357AEB4AA8FEB0675
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x701C6D5A294031F20B69EEC875371A74
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0x8D8FC614BD4200D5B6804BA3EADE627A
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xDCE96B94E534E65EBA0AF1CC62850BB1
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0xE67BFDE302201005B3E3FE9CDF2BBA8B
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0x069F7AC73809C01B905DB16DFFBA1096
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x2644446C4A73A7F48B8F6A3C076CE0B6

Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0x42975ED623FA3384C1C1A460F5E7ED28
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0x84CA521DAF393367CBE97EF586FD6C58
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0x6DAD2B97541EE987741D1E0CE679978E
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0xED14ACEFB8FBAE2941CA752BD49E1FA5
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0x88E0BA871F0A7EB3E63BA9384DA04F4F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xF4E6BAAD349D95EC3AAAF228DFC7B1F4
without reply as without delay.

CHAPTER VII
0x41867681DEE279BB7D74C8BBEFA2FBEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0xAB117B87888329CA1CF47F2D87B883B7
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0xB90F5C62933CE3A9C2F68630FDB54B92
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0xF3049AD5F952A7B78C2F83C271065176
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0x6898F0A9F91AF3C5884AD6E2D5F313B8
were no trifles.
0x58302DDA2FEDBD54D23704E8025C4A5C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0x8980CE74463BFB9C36FB2AE58D699F09
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x7DF013D3F1795B88D8E19853F5B185D7
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0x69F90A7AF4B8D08A5017BC33510F42CA
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x155BFDD90F7865703D098840362DB66B
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0x2BE30A6D104C9DF76FCB05F8FBB44C99
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x7843EF2C4A3114C3380C1BC2450B8F40
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x77F963CC93863063CEE197F72486CA7D
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0xDDDEAECB9B0AABF7D202DA9E21BCF089
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x3FE1C4F18A6DA95730650FD623DBD753
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x8EB80CE98BEDB357305731D6FBD2539A
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0xD6B68F2A043C6959A793C841026ABA76
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0xE3A52A1288853918C8D4F8184E15BCBB
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x0365C504A8B73B696D5C70377166F045
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0xECD104E603302C61F276BB620C0193A6
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0xD47468E5651B356E61179B473B9BE0B4
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x6D96144A9482EAAC1D95D292BE141482
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x91246C4AFF378B5E590EB46EB705AB6F
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x303D121213B97A53982FC04FDC946167
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
0x00B6CB4531BC22295028C3134DA75DAE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0x1D62B715A80CE1694D08571F157A2415
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x929DE11478EBAF8407CC73B95A87EEF7
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x45A00F3021B87D7E0D43D1072CEE78B1
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0xA50D8902815CE52ECB122DABDFB5C412
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x3851AD53F9A44F6E5F446B7F5D9109ED
meals, was served round between the services.
0x405C181A965DBDF6B3A69A8A32590738

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0xE91966298408BC05634A0E64E4B3ED20
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0x65A4D0DA0D4FF2C19C93CC40F5B2F3E9
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0xE1E74885DF1803C0EC1919522AA680FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0x4A2F071E4A395A719FFDD4803779E52E
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0xD99B92C86A924B7D0D048ECE2A30FBCC
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0x2353C2256364674AA464745CA66A5C2B
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0x3E798AB3106C6D458EFDF87ED345B893
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x9603F55545446C52ED662B82EDD8BCD5
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x29DD0E169B6FA3F5B496173F90DE64D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0x28AF8DB4A092C01B4013D9E3CDDDBFC0
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0xE67CD5AE493CAA21EFD240F19A970E7B
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0x71EB92CBB5C8FDA511AB58109F0D2D14
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0x2CFC83675EBC5ABDF58AD3AAB8CC46D6
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x831BAC92A5403EBBD0CB156CFD3B040C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x93DF06177CD8476B0DE60AB436D7BE28
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0xFF0ACA236F737A64C1DFF21EEA205953
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xD1BE17F4A6B22BE980614E29EDF861EA
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0xD0D7CD7E25A98B8DD3956B4AC9D1A6EE
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0xFEDD05FB9A01CBB44F6CE1F12D88D53B
invariably obliged to part with.
0xF4CA225D45017FB76CB1A7DC88C12537

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0xB3B64B975384914C70C2C5A8D9963780
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x60B51BC3884E268C76ADA3D49B3F3E37
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xC2B57A5B7BD48080182E27BF537ADB5C
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x44BB9FDFE4C5B5E800B08D553F4CA2FD
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x6E9BA643845C53B3AFF623A6AB6528A2
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x293DEBB8BED0D30EF02CC4DCB33F00D3
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x8D5C7F5A9A7489B76B9588BE1B51FEEE
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x2AA6EE92D7C6564E64F6E94E1AED62EB
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x63C7E43F1CBE9734976A208C3534E746
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x2F147D52E449E78EA0AC0BC41C04F3EB
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0xB3811CCC20C9F17B4CE533C3A901EC76

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x9AB924C38AF020CC1ED205F44DD83FE8
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0xFC1A9DAF42F7D8724DD87C6A3CADCD8F
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x6130B4BBB70630BD63D2FA56852C96C9
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x644E5507A73D683D11989DC4C4158F01
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0x5C6953F754CC381630E37ED7367CE554

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0x1235C326CC74FAD0F8B8EA2ED8AAF2B7
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0xAA62AC20ED0B283C58E9CEC594EAC8C9
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0x91C38D9B474EBDD45FE05C5CBAF3E77B
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x54DD8F4BD358A58830E624F39344F712
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x989404E6A0D7C2A583E2866F7B801056
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0xDBAE6735D254BA2025B9310B0A022A8D
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0x153DFEB768B24F9DBF58F55942142BDB
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x08C34632B08A27C0D3D5229F4F28C7B0
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0xB61B9EE41A139A3A1ED3E1763C6D84D0
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x647492FF324665AE3EEB6EA0426AC91C
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x1692BA55346FBBAD7455FA0E326CA2A4
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x596F6115D0833163DC25104671CC25E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0x21CE3733413F556037350C63E7F6E120
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0x64E7A4545D4D7BDB9EA75E21A5EC0B6E
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x604E07B05FB10D2587A791603A8C29A1
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xD2FD035F3026805507A8B0F54C28B881
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0xDD4A65032F66F8BCE339AF5065A2FC89
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x54A1951F07C5D4B5D8213FA735CC29FD
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.

He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x30161C9A13FD00B2FC6529239C4D2D0E
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x1B93B58A7B32F5D2A301A5B858F2F676
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x46EA5C94FB79C7742DA696C7CA1AEE48
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xA384976E01F9C53F6B76912D1A651B55
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x1E7D1E18FC0964FCB78D3F1BE33DBD10
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0xF7CF7704AD586180E9812CF4DC41B4CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x5C851213B990ABC1AEE5C80EF3C24D0D
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x7D924EE57248F43A05FD920B3284F3E9
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0xD1CAFED5537AC57581B3B29FE11AFEBB
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0xA06415F93B77F8B9EE1CE171BD61D560
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0x364858C4A49F943CB12C78ECD1EC30E3
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0x34EA3EEFDF5303AB1D880B5D82B9045D
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0xC2C2513B8AA2D9DB66C21DFBFC78BDAE
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x4794EAEE9D6417BBC190ECE51611931E
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x5BCD880BFEA49CFA86384BA179381372
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x065D9BA0A877DDA00F643A547158330E
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xBEB89AF506BAF61C83A73479A672D506

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He paused.
0xED23A9D7ED1258106DC89926191FEC0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0x39F88631A184184467CB0606B497AD44

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xDB52A610BAB9874E875BC832315A5FDF
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0x72A8EF6D9879B859ACFBDE9A661C4E52
to one."
0x51A5540021239EA60536324022D62109

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x216F8C2CDF007A1533527B62C7D032AE
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0x8620433806154238C55ACDF2C610CFC9
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x89D0561D6F52B9717320CDD27D018C99
occasion."
0x4582B7324A8305FFA050632A2867C227

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0xC9954E583027F8B9944EDDADD5817CA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xB4FBDA153469EF03293E6FE946E4E123
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x7F6C184F753924247FA30DDCC6B83715
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x0A90BDD66E6446F8FEDFA236B8C5662E
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x7EE101D13AAD09CF87642CEACC3FAA98
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0x60A6DFEED3E78F716CA2160DC5F3BA19
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0x4CAA191C688EEFFE7D4599EBD3E4A85D
what authority?"
0x4CD0D95B8AB92D83402FA0EB77B60878

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xCB84068A3880E502E38AED0B613E3D98
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x81D76ADC5C991C1105339FBEB066D879
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0x28EC9412A5446F2BFE985DC021EFC29C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0xCA29E448FB681A37208F668299161231
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x58BB905C8E2E587296F2BE6659C629AA
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x28568EE1DDF22AA8788F90996C8C1376
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x436730F260037CCE06E64144D4589935
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0xEA68DB88374FD64F20B041CE946B242C
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x13221CF7C35BF64E3548549346A8300A
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x4C298CC726423A263508AB8920901B14
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0xC29CEFD10A57221AEF53EBF433C914A0
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xAE05447CA96FDF2A0FE374CD2D4F8993
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xC780552A7EA70A0F67310324531593B7
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0xA7A49C79DFA81A8DB665DB123F3A318A
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0x7B557D7F877446FBAA86CB3FB9FFD908
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x9F2271F646A60847943688B391594B9C
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0xE26D97B70C520B2046AD7400242C2B3A
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0x6BD0E80C3E6CD70E9BF9158F86549DC8
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x6FF2BB7FDA0B2079D4F91C83D878F519
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x0CF936D5CD15215691C9D48BD9CAE88F
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x0E4AE33B293B11CAE0A09B837160C20E
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0xA353DCFEA150797E1C55288AF2C257B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x2677CD7025C64CE20D92ABB7B9D3E5A2
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0x719EAD95BCB0AA6339AD98D87664E2A3
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x556B7AE1C4C9742FC7B4469111B9F592
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0x6CDD2B8E8CFF3BAB90939CF1A955CB00
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xE132F6174EC3DA5BE83F1A2B8380BB60
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0x888FEC585296F366AF52FBBC3B8C78D7
severity.
0xBF89FF21021A94DF647F789B3354894F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0x0BEFDF81105D94BE14DACD7D12987065
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0x36C7A3A4919815461759A51E0C760182
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0xC88BF7D77DEC913DC0A8160E9626A56B
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0x2734129777D7826037F1B1861FAEA85C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0xE57692E16EAA15A8FA3C22279E2F21F0
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x3362E872FC34E7605DF986CBE52ACEF1
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0xD85457C390C0DA8E67B56DCA350ED7A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x7A691BB63EAEA78407A8786D6EF82782

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0xEB27D89787EE6E2FCF3CB106B0D0F43B
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0xD74DE769A467B2499F0630A1BF5BA4A7
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xEABE0D89093650B73C8D88336A6A4F52
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x4B6B8BA886B6DDA7DB5DC194FEB4CCCA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x87F689D998BE86A81783E2F45133603C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x8EA87CFD4B548BAE81FBC635DC1C6405
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0x0920B48FDEEA8B2173100C4D8A9834DB
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0x3D654C24A98DB22F4DC17E43E113B192
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x87A34ABCCF093579472DB933AA6BE543
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0xB706CBEDD47A4CC6AF54344E7D4C8069
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0x35CFD2695E1314A9ABFAB4FFA5705E98
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
0xBA312D4D3E05384CED20C2425519F092

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0x2E80A0BDE0099F1DEC83BA22C6A59F98
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x645EDDF8E0D26B4FF811A626BFA4D5B7
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x0CDBB4FC5FC5EB00B42C8C370935F118
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x88C2E9C066E7041EFB71548A2089DA94
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0xE32E543BEF34F2013807F06B5B48032E
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0x2F025A774023E1024CCEBD8BA65FEF94
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x2450111EDD29C6710E2CD7D0FA87C318
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x2DDF24F164FF8E75647682B28ADA24EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x1D4A1E0FAD542B53D889EAA6DC94279E
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0xE36CC9129E8A4C5C7E1688DF4257DD95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x1659D5DB07A5663A6C8E58D62545D99E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0x9D3D8B1B7EFF6C113227ECF246C5122D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xFCB2716D2522EE780EF675992AC701B2
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0xC6BD26BE7DC5DCF8CF3AFB1058A9640C
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x8A1F4494FD2822595B73B98E1F9FA4B2
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xA07E4690E4E184C5FBDD92D6065212E9
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0x848BB412D9F707ABB0897FDC7427FAA8
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0x6652DF7FA289E082525F80921711E28B
time wasted, of--"
0xC5F1BF7365D02C1915E813F5820BD21D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0xFA6153A92418034BE01364429D4814BE
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x0DE9695DEB65365E58D085EA4779B726
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x9F5BFD48889E7BE6B83DBA6E7AD233C8
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0x7C59F9E724D0F3794B5FC8859F3DAE0D
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x131FF2321505E6D71E518A8376F27D45
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0x00076A8B3BF1BD03908DC8E6B7065433
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x4AAE872CFDE22FDB7129D72A0AAE07AE
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x4F2DAA66BBF5251B42A7336ED8EBB9B7
false front of French curls.
0x6567285CAC8AE9BA0662AF2E1DC89913

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x7D4744B15F2A7C0FB7E2979CD59F0E9C
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x6C334DF78F135DEAF0ABDCCDDB67C0F5
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0x920161840D1EE5AC5C77872CBF31BEA1
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x1E10CDA205A00C9A9829A30F1D4925FE
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x54976962F8DAF690281C1F94A727D2B2
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0x247FB1745E194C10FF63C9156B8FEB97
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x027BB2C3D7B5DCC6D65F34011BE3F2BA
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0xD472E34AE251688A68E7604A68EB6795
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x58D7B05BE7E49364E2AD6098D83E0179
my attention.
0x1CAD08CC813F7019CDC1AF90FE95E3E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x56CF1E626876FCB2B97030B6F5DD272D
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0xBCF24261657F6FB8BEC45FC7F4CF4ADD
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0xA5CAC9997A0F9CB3ECCD9DDAA945E5F8
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xD3F2D2D1D28E1A4325F98041DABCEBD6
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x53DE6F2E5CB2D72C73CE93286A1BBD32
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x864457FB45828A5BBAEC9029C5BA0693
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xEAE6279B7B6CFCE6A58BD0B6F6184C55
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0xAED35714377794297AB26D266C51929D
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x13594FFDA3B299DFD0CAB845BEFEACE4
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0x7A4DF069C19587541A3C997B4DA39547

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x4B0B8337D9FB26A6E71D96E118BB6460
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0xEFCF74326A272F3C158A492B25AD5B36
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0xFB0E58A178B7FA12A555ABE2D052E5D4
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0x6824F71A45CFBF7BF4AF12F17F4EE6B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0x6BEE97FA743FF8343A7CDEE2FDDEBF73
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0x6FADB35A4A242EA8D232BD7033D24B2F
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0xA19695E70916F8C2A3E88EDE868711B6
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0xFE8E3C48C00F9D7D3396F9B7E9F2B7C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0x1FDA8AB5445DE30F0099E00B230DBAA8
punished."
0xEC3AEACAF677C331DC520C434E5D030C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0x2B1F173877B80D2A03280C719A270A60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0xCB27795227D15C5BC48335CBD163AB0B
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x8FF5D2ABDA980998F0079B773C76FA44
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0xD0A85BEDC117C0B82B1E1918D446EFA0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x378FD276F145A42630079ED105523910
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0xA512F539906DCCD29E05B0BA41D96BC9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Place the child upon it."
0x2F355A8E42DBBEBA9EE0881658D774A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x1D7D7F889A3518895ED87C51EE18E17C
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x0F150C1632A690851FBD8DADEA04E5FB
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xA1D14666C15ECD4705750CBF703787E2
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x0F9D545BD149EF8A1B06C2C9B3A78093
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x19F82B65A3A0603C44982C5BBAC0BF1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0x8814E5192F8226EE97D851CF957A6EBB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0xA0652EEEB10E5152D6BDF596DA13B1F5
children, you all see this girl?"
0x4A1B6A19899977C068D06AE5D0972E8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x0A673EABAB177963E75CE515F8413F42
against my scorched skin.
0xEB4E3D2474FE3362B15DBF499BC7C79B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0x43325C0475AF759A8A8BD0241D96807D
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x0E3E0A4A5BC99F0E6319ECA8C5854478
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0xE41F1298153628B5CBF40DF715D23353
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xDEB0A26C80072CFFC4AA323AE93AEC7E
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0x0AF4FEB36D5CB0CD240B445B1BF4367D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0x2E7ABA8834A94AF0ECCD35835EDE42C3
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0x87906A9B484AE982CC07D7194705B893
must be firmly sustained.
0xE82A13F46B68762C7B98F7C400BB63CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0x5975837C386FBF2CD3B73520E86BE4EC
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0x75DC775FF06C55F8D318E2EA9E2030BB
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0xB8B2C787F5D727A2954C0710B3D36658
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0xA3CA917480CC8E2C9835370F70D444F9
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x96AA0D3FA492CADFF63AAFB85EA8B56E
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0x95562F3C78C8DFC5D2B67B2EA1196D13
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x04A1FB6B9F0F959B743DB20A2AD7F18C
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0x01A0CCCE6F7A17E569BAEBD8771FDAB4
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0x77E4D1D5BF9D20DF883CA72D976765D2
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x15277CEC565E23FB81106A24F4A5255E
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0xA6C92A960F9FE47727649AB481898AC4
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x71244BAAAC16959E7E99BD42121F8930

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0x043D07B0EDBC02CEEF8D58155C822F98
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x461E3787E4A4C76A2DC2801205E3BB1E
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0x0F21287C8C9FC1452632AB1D79EECBAE
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0x54D570280CF6E33B1B7A5A60AAE404FD
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0x3E93FD2C677E0096F544D6373490D7F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0xF7E7D2CF8C165D819CDB12FCDE40566E
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0xFBC24BC647E80D0FFA223F973EB2B5A1
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0xE90378F722E5827E82F0D44DF0235EB5
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xC2CC9F6E69B4F810D4E36798BF494CCE
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0x3D72F9C9DA35040C997F7BBD8404843B
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x5BB0E675C229C7F206D32B0636FDFB45
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0x4E18C92C8B7B8A3F8F623AF14228468E
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x4F3CFD228ADC7D83E4B4408D81A96536
waters to stagnate round her."
0xB13D31BB7E755F08B907BC84AEBEEC08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0xA6F27B0F3464EF8A370DDA7319ACA205
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0xA78530C6C71BB36A1A70D16486750560
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0x5FB68CFB6879FF6D7656BF18D3335D12
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x2D040D6273CCB44CD3063B619912FF44

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x365C383F16E3F6C0A96C603B9308FA8D
her during the remainder of the day."
0x22FF4EB6F0C06937808460D581734CB5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0xF707C124ADB9041B8BFA8F8087150BEF
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x63C3BF71C522EC261F8D2333309F822F
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x35CD8C477B7B80FAA7766C5B5EB4BD5E
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x3527B128A50AD849A9FF483F17E2F991
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0x1F3FB102BC55687882F76FC72BAF0E22
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x6803620B2763063E27BDB595508337B3
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xCFD04DB3B97BA1027D93EEE3410E3361
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0x7123842553BF668E10D1200BEEBEC789
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0xFEFCA199D44046DA82C8F34F7DC98101
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0xB6855844E6B9BAD957F4286138213EB2
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0xC4F62FA9CC91EB8A4A965DEBB83FB059
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x7C9680EFBBC1990F9A3F24118951057C
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0xC75676502494B75962CBA5B7E83530F8
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0xDE3A722AA55CF0787CBD16EFB7D19A79
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0xF0829B7B3D788575163E8C0C438DE5EF
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x52CCA36F0EC2EBF7AF1E3A36D9A93B45
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x3ECB3C4D959A4C064110DE6B8FA8FF0E
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0xB765C648C694CAA81700A2F3153FE6FC
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x6EF6CB44B9B249EF31CCF3E0E3DB6B51
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xF69D463BD299A1A756DB6E336E83B32E
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0xE340E152D75B80548E37B3B69D8216CA
the full brightness of the orb.

CHAPTER VIII
0x5449E413109999EFB50C43A25084D568

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0x9DEE4722A1B2AB5C63899C7BA2AA416A
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0x7436952A7BDDE59B63B837E169E91660
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x8624B6F7CA66CB53785D51B69F671620
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0xD883EFC77A031E47A28FA70BDBA5199F
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0xDB24C43B3B14774DDCD8632C8D62BE0C
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0xCB47D65987AAAC702B63323E2A8CCAB5
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x9B73D62CE093A748FD57F95D58D91477
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x6697754C5A7C6F953AB1D2057B22E77B
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0xCF8BECF6CC94E8C7F9A84090A437A941
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x63D03103260A71D9E1BE294CE1C14BF8
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0x326549E131E2FCDF3A09FE365AD87F6E
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x28A2FD974B7141ABE43491B987ADCD37
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0xB51FEDB7837DF1EC9381363DF0392FF0
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0xB88166CBC99172B8940F4B7D0AD0092A
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0xAB63BFE57328B4A9975EBCAE5A052C75
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0xC3A10476834D4A478E26A9536063D3B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0x75BBDFAF9B4A919B5123A6860DB9348C
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0x5E7F40375EEC4C1B5BA0468DCE440DF4
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0x27205C6A7E478D5CDC7463F3B2B04E45
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x07444296F45E2A1B8AF689C6238E5D6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0xD2DA09169661932AD7B4B16788EC5B66
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x8DFA501CE87425FB8CEAF37EEFC93999
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x32AF6CE86D03EEA40F76A2A4DA876194
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x3E05CB0E84F2992E4F24B41C1D9D50FB
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xA49AF2EB19DC236912B8F9AF2C2449A8
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x1802DCF12E377FD49D81FDF60BBA1E8F
first who spoke--
0xB8011822F129A2D1539C882F7F24E989

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0xD5CF977194B002D777EA21A9393C04F1
liar?"
0x7DEF536C7DEF536C256B5FAE97FD7346

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0xBA7417369F3ACC1978FA2A69F9444157
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0x7B7B2BD08B6FC71EBB045714E9469173

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0xFA520F35E43AF21EF87A9CA0815393A6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x07E910A01A1CF710A32CC1900F06B6D7
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0x3BC051AAA65917BDEC415A683AFBE628

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0x0193BFC5EEBA35BBBFF0CCF71CB3673E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x98E3AF9654482BD0AA3F29207838EFBD
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0x99E5D52AC855F01A15F8051911808FC5
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0xE685855D843F2CE2F8219131511B49CD
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x9382076D56B81F52F7ACCAD23DEE47C8
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0xA2BD99038C904A98E98AEEF0B29108FC
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x95002C5BF006A8A485BF5A8848357C4F
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x972C51CF959ADE165C0BCCB31A64A798
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0xA312BDC88CA5BFC4F0C2450173E3EBCC
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x45ED74210439353EDBC242EC373A435A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0xB7568152FB90F4B9C7EFF9EAD9A35693
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xFD6881496252E9D32AA8CD5BBD7C6B0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x9A225192EB18EA71FF3372DA17849530
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0xD75105A43CD3FEB059BA2BB315BDD840
without friends."
0x8FB2118ED961C3D400291E4913EAEEAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0xDFC4065E056CC31A35094085F219133C
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0xBFEF9BD420EA6C598A3DBF6EEE2FE3AF
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xAD665C4463E17824AD9B7F10CA9A7977
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x705207918024E7011FEBCDDE4315C7EF
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x694706AC6DA3CED1C2CB3304CC4037A3
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0x46E18B70777647CA266389F46722531D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x1D3BFF0A0C11004AE36DFD13A473B959
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x6070E9C3688CCCB523693C1F067E1EA9
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0xF35F44FB851974C5425ACDBD01B20F94
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0xC44EF90E6C6FEFBB46FDEAC359B7D3CB
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0xE48ADA803AB8283ED047739FC578B0EF
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x4F7E81C744505EC1326F56FACDC26A38
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0xDC948A923CF8B61A94612207013ED7C3
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x7E5AB895EE50DEE107DDE69C64035AA5
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0xA175395238A332B1E73DBE62C5B636AB
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0x2BA22A759C1791F13F88408496F3D998
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x0DFCF7237FC97C32FEDB39FE0880709D
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0xE45D7181E79E97925BAE0B7881C6A944
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0xF91171B483724568A151226C25F55C45
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xBC45A30B4C30D5605736C7F5E4573A33
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0x3EF877ABB7C13FA8A247D27196F3ADA5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x10FA34030012E544F0D771286AC3DCC9
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0x0038EB06C36305CC73E7A7138D9E9706
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0x565E08A795DEC67738A90C2393FB89E5
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xE15AE7E732660BD5D61DA0AD78001370
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0x7228797E7E6B86B38417999563AE234C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x25532F87A724A1BF69B715CB9D72B70E
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0xE7A3B24062A65D4003BFBCE7F70561DE
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x5F2FCC62B770DEA6E7FC3FEF975F7BB3
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0x079B33C6279D1A0BE619A126B05B0F6C
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x971B6962BBA356265E31BD023856087A
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0xE445810E1D232C185441E5DC1D256AEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0xBFD5A619418C9F1DB3CC931A3E9A704C
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x5EB164DCA020F2A5991D99426B326AEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x9A9E5CBCC3893A2780F42274ACB401D6
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x400DEE2C4E48EF38C9AE6D85895E1D33
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0x7129926DFF81D2F2CBAF7DDA4E581372
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x3840AC0344147D4764F323DA63499B25
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x222F3D57B06722BFD3AE116E0C2D2B0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x4386782BA33EEE2989013E5316FCF670
your grief away?"
0xFB97FBE4BEF277F5DC2DF14597C5E265

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x2CA356AC76578F74C065CF1FF4446E15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?"
0xAA617C58AA617C585B4BC71B70A543D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0xAA5A58B80BC9DF5E8A9FF6CF6871B59D
will now think me wicked."
0x65296360C7F8D4BC5BACBCB9A2C74671

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x872AC6EF8D47D9D48F1C905104947348
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xB3F66959F018377C3450225278AE5660

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x8EE10FF6B4AAAD6C2E7239826C29B1CE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0xB241FFBEEFA3C87E9CAA4F58D6CF83AF
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x66AD596B8C4D3D2890434353635450D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x68D911CEDDA381DD59BC8E3062E8EC9A
care."
0xD618A1FCD618A1FCD453822348CBDED8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x1FE8429305084F06FA03FB3220A301BE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0x2D44C2F2CE9021D72CFB7966854E8838
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x727E3FB8A84C4BA3228389D1AC34F8A2
always keep me."
0x6DE29D9D605297A380A4CC4BDBFB2349

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xE06F24395AC2505A98686DA02E3B077E
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x148ACCB6DB8CC53AD005659907328D32
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0xACB333EB8D7E4AE2AECC7F52F5BAA450
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0xA1CF9385C752AB87CDA2A904BA82761A
exaggerate nothing."
0xF4A6381C28F3A0218E172661A9557A87

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x5509096E803BD4425E693D5F77E90EB2
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0xE55F17385159245E2909ED5CD97080BA
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0xA99A332AD651063872AA1ED0DB9491E4
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x8A8B3C2325733C0090930001C83B9C0D
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0x825B16E1322FAA31F48BA3D6E4AF58F9
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0xDBDE03746E9DDBED0306B4F1B73C7CF8
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xB30C8E9C1BF88D230F9866C1703D56A2
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0x3303BFC9EE858C5675B963007D6BE33F
Temple fully believed me.
0xFFBAD316821380962371FCD25085B0E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x2976FE8AB54E33EADFB7DC1C22FCB1DB
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0xB6E88A16D12B2C6DB96A96C126958942
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0xB7A329B0ACC695D77B56534252AE6FDB
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0x64D1045DA485A9B373475CD5E457637F
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0xAB20545E4B128AD9073C12F878CBF829
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0x1D3792F39477C24BF03E354A6BAA669D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x0C0C3C1207CB1C4F259A3F9D9E691CAD
then said--
0x0B4152816BD44292ADF4F0185ADF5F0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0xA0A3D87ACD9E6DA5CAD77F1E67A5DE83
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0xBD58968035BAED61670A3AC62644BE45
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x81CEF3A70F561DFFD806893402F406B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0xE29A0CF6C0760E6371332E22C3DFB57A
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0x86EED3FB317E815D61F5161AB1D13991
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0xF1408CD5A126D4D9484033510E13E1EF
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x31B9E44D38CDDB9C6B4D02522043FA01
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0x07548FB33C2797FFF1994ADF92AD9B43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x6BE50E002607BC44360C6FC5FA270673

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0xD6287FD6A6C95364F9E88B2FC7194FBA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x7CA7D911B156EC09CFE4D345E2FEACE6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a little better."
0x75796A587F2928492518590B515ACD8F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x515B9B15093C99DB6D17331383B069A9
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0xD4F78069799C72636185364AA1C01913
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0x01850359B6239A82A3034717E4E3DB8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0x1CDBA90B9FBEFDBDD52F1BCECCA4A1C3
rang her bell.
0x787C24E57D6DF1121B0474A741C0CE66

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x8511AE64B1D33F7C9E87D0A82CF8052B
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0xC6A38F7EA846229198B48A3F54795A60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0xFEC7941A25B50A2D1268D6A721F3BEAB
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x572DCD6707B4316CD880AD5FE674246F
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x53D490E9BCBF8C29581AFF3ED5010B1D
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x2B22DA105136AE6AA0B4BDDE61B79FDE
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x57232336B3CACCB5C088A014E67AFA40

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0x983D8FF1C2305EA4A53E4BA449B90C06
There is not enough for three."
0x723681851EB702E65F043FA312CBA14A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xCF236E9C09F55BFEB8335D2E14C17A25

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0xAA827F5CAD7ADB4E971CD19F0BD1F97B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x65231B068E9EB1D7871B847C61AEB51A
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x316BEA291437AEDA166BA073FB20C64C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0x3473063FB2CB5AF89F32CF10A51EF0A0
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0xE6F24EFF88EAF2B06BC5B777FAEEE1FA
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0xBFFB1B22EFB334E5C555D3053AA95F35

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x37F11A729DF574332664073C19E91C00
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0xC03A5C79E6A256C1EEABE36B37AC9E2E
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0x3F41349A272D2293A3FB181DB43A3812
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x0F50C7B96D7E08280D6F3EF0617513E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0xD59F3073E5581E6E8CDD293B2A350154
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x3CFE9BDAC8A17401A19A3CE4ACF62EE8
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x04AE5F55208B459FF6F8F4A901B0D008

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0xB446A252DE9FBD753AC2679C770EBDD1
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0x67357C79C3CF90B2E49FBC0F4842364D
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0x6254364E4DA47887D72F6443F943CC89
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0xD5413B5320E494490C2F0E961D482518

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0x82AE01D896CBFC2AF8E23326489B9B71
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0xAC89EAC84B6AA300BA614ECE07E5C827
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0x2DA4E5528760996404F4C171C489C7B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x565CC502C803D61C3BC1AC849320F893
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0xCEA00066DB1DCE1E4CAA226AA55A498F
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x60AC704B1B9291F820B67E581863FC4B
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0xF6F955850235D0CDF7DF2651232B4F4B
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0xBAF2B34435E44319FE4BD7746DF40F7E
struck with wonder.
0xC3EFD711B278600C77A544A7CC057B81

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x7618EF64A50016248F9C7DC5B9C5E089
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x3847496D235A45D05393C81F2749578B
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xF3D0829533B135BC7B2B26F87DE6B47F
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x8FF197E6654EDCFB216CCBA92351A20C
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x01B3E54FF5E349432FCB5FFF1FFF6C87
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0xAC6C818138B7DD3D66E8DFE63AE548B0
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x2D8B9F80F2F7B54A92A494610B7DBAEB
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xC369A1C2CE1096F87AE66AD59E028010
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0x2E563261C6081B7C02FFE5676CBCEFE4
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x11282801275212C0948D16C0A43AAF3C
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0xAF10C659DB24F423B85E8E166F9160AE
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xBEDCAE3C90878F7F50280652154D2672
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0xC962424422989E2E5E54F2A6D5328126
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0xCA68294C57B2960266952BA8B25B5776

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x72ACB993A7AC1E89F45E5DA096A0493F
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0xE54CACA7EC087F997B0D30942E81DADF
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x8CC87721F751820709F4442ADB07279F
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0xF2C51EB2FBA74A8D26E2D35FAA0B865D
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x660F16E70BE083563D660D148CDF8791
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0x77C6F3CA1185C5B47F23E5B0A0FD9C67
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x7B29AD71DEB89D7A0087E29E5AEF7C7B
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0xC689FA3B1DFBB31394E4163BAB432FDA
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x57A9A4E3AC8FAD024D1BD183A06C4884
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0xFBD70E44CBD91F0EE8613BA9E76E4730
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0xA2D9EFB8110E71BD80D3B1B31CC2EA2C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God bless you, my children!"
0xF028417800B5911DDC55B85E9E6936D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0x4A8C96EBA3350C6FDA0960F0729A3732
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0x373C5F416F427469BF65AB20CF07048B
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0xCF3BC1459164190B625AD8937626AB11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0x4A09C3AA1C9943B20EE83FCD1DA44B3C
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x9821119CA22CBBE63C2EB1F0746A46F3
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x493AB71CADA58A7BA497DA7D7AFBB81C
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0xF32CB9CF2E5808D175922798B9B588A2
shoulder.
0x23F16DEC007DAF656591CD9227EEB18C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x2EA38FDB452EDBA3E1A0944FA2EE8A88
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x094460D1D2CEAAB86672479DF0E14628

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x009C0002503F80E64B8CAF6EBF5EA23B
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0xDC4FE8E1EA2B8BE21EA1882F91A769B6
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0xDCA2AE2609CA627512E087D344FD3107
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0x8A564C23429AA839B06D42D751987D32
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x0D1C62E95CE77AF2F8F535F604F4792C
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xD77BCDE15BCF4012EC905791F2F88D8F
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0xB081B0164F01EA05753FB24C2CE5AB9B
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0x5BE2620783EF279ACEFC4F72CB97BF0E
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0xF40AA60CF28A1D62F3B69EB545E88B14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0xD1B3500E7865CC558E70608C7484B1D5
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0xC1EAF75EA87A919BD50B33F5CC8965EA
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0xAAF1939776220B42BA9701B8402E9252
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0xB578457E10375881E078B617E4C140A3
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xACB1127E86DCD2C069DE62FEDACF295E
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x129A5C64C04FADCBF497C90A0F2E255A
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0xD2116B1603215DED121290F5B3543DC4
through the ranks of my companions.
0x121F7D24A3AE8A02F56221C1E2717BB7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0xE2C8E2CA3EE25437934883384E17265B
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xF6E48DAB9F8E6170F35DD4F146803BF6
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0x141A112A64FBF47975652B6AF626B63C
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x7D809ED2EC795F64A24EFEE024871C9E
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x57A2A336916EEA51685020FA96DCDEE6
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0x2E36A176854C5EA8CD105B16C9EC81B8
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x3D522AA8BB98FB5B5503521E866B6F25
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0x953A0E23C64A71F5DE234993C1496A87
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0x1CCA1EA4F72A8E7FB84BF41DAB3ED508
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x4A53C180F3EB6DC7990A924C011CF268
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0xEA548BBA044EBBB0122F408263A081A0
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0x0AF325FF0E58DBC8FD0A3B8ABAEAC472
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x4DA5A50733B56229F00CF53D90371C0E
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x2D5272927BE4E3E70A39D5217750AD59
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0xB5EB548DA19AA91A9393A5EEFBEB06B9
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x23A7D1B44C3B83CDD26E0BF35051E0B9
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0x97A72D42A404A65DE6BB4D62D571C7C6
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x190B1C868A8224960AC032F166F720C8
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0x2A1A4E53F034E5C7AB4CF9DEA9CBA72F
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0x266CFE7B08207E21B8F96ABB7477505C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0xA2C49E9DF4997DB364ACB6E9904B506E
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x8159B083DAF029E4C6E4A7B68A96A90C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0xC16425449E2A164137D1A3CC20EA5E61
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.

CHAPTER IX
0xC6A09FB4CEA1FCB32E0699A1095235DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0xDF51B3912EB9F6A30594957451BD3209
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x01FC011E2E1DB728AADD1BA4E1270FFF
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0x7F9BF92CF790A05D1FB8AAADD6F42AA1
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x9ED7E7867B170DE9CBDD95D3F4AD315A
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0x2BA90246DD2AC97A5E8B7CCA45F1434B
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x47B33290D191FEDE4EF6F56082ADE05B
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x9916A111113DF3163347009E7CB5DB07
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0x8169D17544F6795ADBB64E832354D8EA
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x941B572A67FC31C3400983813FDE2B3F
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x04BBF9A0D53A5A85ED46841EE4209557
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0xA9EA74E7711D8D499FDA8F38A9BC59CA
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0x577C7EBFC0879318BB022736AD90DBB9
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x87C715CB1AB524B11FCA3170D3C837C0
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x3FCD5F0B0585E2243CDC9F206B1B226A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0xCE21FC2EDBEA1C6A07BA62736BD24300
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0x7240DAE3A09C3A0293539D8D07A27B68
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0xF327E97DCA068DF7173A41F0D9872363
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x512DC926A1CF9F08EE433192039F7005
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0x910D65730A95934C3102E545D5B0C6C0
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x655056AF1B3ECAF1A64FC0BB80C606BE
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0x45989D7E396300BD17D2DF7EC4255A0A
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xA5EE1756019CEA8AA491D86DC31D1D4C
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0x8C31CAC76F5019950D50C40359AD313B
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x4A625D4CE73C0D69A562920BA8370D66
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x5762724C78D1E3143EE4A6A243AE7F97
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0xB833B4A6407297BC879A5B7BFDDD7D6B
of skeletons.
0x16737466B2677EBB80DE89FFD056A74C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0xED8A2414CA7459889F29080F37133791
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x6BFB64C4DCA346995A4232BB748D97A9
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0xD9ED754EB6A11D5D1FCA2247D55A7924
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0x34A383F36EBE2B36FCBFB5B841AD2476
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0x65655F31C36BC00622BF105F38828A28
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xC195B46E57DFB814B6FCFAA868CE9702
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x92699FA82976E2224789B8E178ADBBF7
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xA4C34A4CE5E69335A89E79D96D200049
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0xEAC7C61E889F5E9365A781952CB47B52
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x3FCD9626292B3870F256F755D1877CCE
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x7BDA2A8E599D4471ED16E27CDE1CB0E8
advert.
0x2C315F1C2C315F1CC5F5EA4F4A02E469

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0x4BD57B8023E2616C4DEE9C6AABA22CE3
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x009F506676AB0FED90E513E1E5F2075B
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0x3FB2D079E5C48805B31935AA16E81A1A
question.
0x9380E537050EB00A9EE55BC7DC04FE81

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x5517208CCC670916531421D6FFD1A313
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xFC0D31283E50E854DF047A4BDBDF93D2
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x414D7C1B9DD3DFEFFCFC4F8CC7644BCD
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x2ECC4397CAE2969E2AF130E96B9194B4
hospital.
0x10D20890C846A06C6C4304B1079BE11E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0xD4909C6E57E460FA94F10B05A7AFAFF9
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x864EF72DE7A291D9B7CE23120115AE1D
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0x90CC4BBC418708BF0E3756A405F99DE7
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0x9B0021BC2194B0301F011A756DBA881E
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0xD194945647A613482A0293A218E49141
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0xA824E89C1C79A9FEEBCAF4AE98972A1B
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x859FEDB01141E570B30126BEEE05A769
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x4BDE4AB724BEA46A10ED1A3A6AECB374
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0x438F97B16D7F5E6A270DB7801223DB60
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x0FDEE3922012FB2D9EC8754AD91DEAE2
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0x71C21C1EE67A1CECE93388E76BE08F03
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x8B660549F4012045B5BA22A7F0DECB86
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0x50A031387EF16361FB888B81533E13E6
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0xF70A016191674760C9F768FC37B8220E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0xDC45973A715964894D601EB7BC70EF4E
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x84C729DA09A32C5429B980A13FE97FE0
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0x5A5031D235AA215BAD3174C8A9723D1C
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0xCEB4D5BF3211FF8D707FC0E5780D0813
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x0B4AE5F6F11F194614638FCA7FC95A2A
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0x1C1C5F94F600DDCF541535B5D4081AC9
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0x7321927BED0AD5F127AA10ACF4F3A707
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0xB9FA88299ADD32274D0C6BD471B991CF
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0x452E09645A08539C0EE894E7A8D6D6E1
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x25FD09FA0292C416191BE5A1407A7A24
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0xEE21195425DC3B0D68A78AC03A2EF9B5
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0x0E609A01DD931FAF51CFBFA69707DC74

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0x55DEAC5336C9906B48087B8753585384
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x6C921CBAF33F5A6AB755BEEB30B8336C
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0xD8728AA7A2C3305D00F864A1208D4AA0
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0x564F51FE81916ECE4F3F1654E5C90108
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0xA43E5535DBE2B35359BB8C77C1EAED88
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0x9F7D5F4C7EEA06C1CC5B9054A4467C21
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0xB7BC005D92CA64D17C216A5B9BF6BA35
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x83CADD3B050BDBDA6CF5AA89F7840F39
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0xF1B06C35BA8D2C6624FCF2A981283B7A
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x8BEBF52D56EB9A7E9A60A8D4C2D650BA
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0xCB3680D791C099AEC9DDE94B648B1EE6
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x6D3CB9C4AEB972D6DB489F006BB48852
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0xF43B56536C7E9FCE39109D4A5E3C85F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x653AF4349A01CC0C3141BD5160803CC6
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x4DF6DEAC915F3C708DE7D722C27CB7DC
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xEC87A6E6D4EAD71737273BAB9709391A
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x4E57EFAB8BF0ADB422AA81468F7BDC8E
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0x30E0E5072FBB6260F377D840BF8189CC
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0x3DBEB28C2893D6AFE361E38AA6F9C6AC
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x95740C91ABD905588D3C784BFDB87A15
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0xD2D210C59A2E9524D5F5CAEBD2BEFD07
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0xC059CB55495B7865E0678BB01CC2E369
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0xB995C608B97347B01598C6BAF98962FF
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0x08F0B3781C9487063549E26E2AC0BFF4
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x668398BA1B354120698F92E7B285BF44
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x2756014FA43144A7E89627CEC7286F0B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x6EB8FFE7F71707E75A2B7F7E894EF461
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xA4727A39B3F715F664779A47AAD635F2
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x9F82012FCAB14B625385C0D9906FC966
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x218E0B22B8E16FB80D1CB19EFD1DAA7B
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x3C2FA0B0EE43254733C4F51976DB2194
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0xCE90968FBA1D3AD9F2CB71594760FE7A
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x93F01F23124CCDE6AE9E95FC493E6AFC
higher things.
0x8EEFCADDFB264FF7ECB93605FD9823D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0x4A7A3B6E93A1CA548EA9FEE379120859
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xBCD3464E76F1502EB093C426B0459F1D
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x0BA25336B5B7004C1B3F7145D3FB596A
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x5C63EBF4EC0780A447484992A37B6068
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x71334DE877C3E4C4DCE22211F39094E2
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xB8974D085EC55964381E522CAA65A2E0
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0x8BF7838857B544DC23E0B2FAC22A971B
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xAA81708EAC16082DD85DA657AE5ACB53
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0x4A07828E25AA5878352E5EF88DAE1B5A
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0xC1B0C8F14C016CE4E6CA958547B08587
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0x443E04316E5F8081F528C87955F1F163
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0xCEC25BEE98E29241F72E22609FDDCB16
alleviate.
0x43C4FCB2C0240938F0058A42A325C54A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0xBC985896E4A556191045DC8A29E7582C
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x0749F27B1D85ECEEFC2D73C05D75FF59
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0x7AB294932C1E1D213C0467234770FE7F
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xCF102FEC00C1A588DEBB2DE7DE2F3543
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x5D6E60436564FD6CFA793C1887361188
verandah.
0x68B72C6A02A40AE7E01800415F21CBFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0xD64ABC56F1F109F76CE873429BD1894F
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0xB1C5345A2077112815EEB1D165E1A33D
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0xA755E3FA69255E78401C54DB862CBB85
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x3BEFC1343774DB34DA43EB4FA0583ACA
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xC67A86A231813189330438187BFA5A75
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x7557E304040E992DADEDE4D1B60CE640
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x4C99016E0BB358EAE0CC779D8E0A9CF4
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x984C03D8827D87C0599B04454C1B94C1
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0xF89769B5F9EAD80F148E09C14AE8AFE5
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0x132AE400C83D4F4D265F5A277D5F6A8A
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0x500FAD321583787CE9BF259401789573
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0xE6C12CADAE2A5C95DC663EB7EFDB160D
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0x75A96A16460DADF3015BB71C31556F19
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0x4E6B4094FF814A128A448A0E709BD096
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x346AC8B2196BE33346BF6AAF3A0AD0E8
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x83947071CEB395AE5CCBB8986B18036B
done before:--
0xF80452E22BA3167D3AA664D80F5A94F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0x11067B9A8382CB380C7E90D00C8DC55D
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x4A8C542404FD4C9C5254C5FB25A99B75
have to go who knows where?"
0x8EC054A54430FD387ED089FC3A6533C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0xE63A5EB86606ACAE81D7AB28B8E16DD3
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0x616677E68D58604A2D0DFDAB2A582630
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x07E0D48DEC92D64182269F2215925399
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0xC8296A1CC896770993DA9770CFABDC0B
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x79F1078CFB3CF1DC1852BFECE26FB811
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0xCB65DA844F697F8BDE38FBB2915A7FD2
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x07F605C3E1B528E011742A941AC46014
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0xA71C88BDBC809253CA900AE1DD177B68
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x66DD1D96CD847B1BC3C7E37D55E77244
ran up to her.
0xADFF1749F7EA74E7E6BE97EBA26940F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How is Helen Burns?"
0x116E9534B11E98FCA7E9E886FCB83E55

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0x0C0085DA29373B6574944083914C3E98

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0xD85B95CE30A6394EAA3CE60F506D453F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what does he say about her?"
0x4475DFB38F6F750135AA5F6508B8C776

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x3636F95A8FF254343542582D929FAD2C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xEDF022FD0E1BF6E826C93A0B0D1EA7ED
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0xADF976C5B50CD11B14A5ED354BE8A22A
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xA403BA76ED7707FB7C9D70C71CB5C6D3
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0xC0C3997EB2D34D843012B80A2AC31539
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0xEAEF4DFB326204D52400EF81A97698AA
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0x4CE73A0285B4166F54C56A5ADBC836EA
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0xBAEAFD9548AAC619402E2850BD8E0DA7
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x1E3A22CEEED28043CF41702E86068545

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0x2BC482700A93788D4EC8DA1C6D7F99F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x47D3FACA07EF671398DEAE087996F4A6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x1185C751CD95D4A71A85F62169D39D38
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x2BDB96576154E56C55FEF44DFAAEB686

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x79FAF243515DB0AF9E938560F4971571
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x48A815A76EC028F70B1AFA833ED8C590
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0xBBBA8BA51F589F3BD2D568D055032EB8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0xECF5A955DCB57FE020B392F932EC0280
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x313B25D7AF701AB057D898BDA2688645
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0xD756F10AE044B71268CA59B9A0399E69
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x40F57CF38044201A99D9E0C87F4FA00A
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x421F5B7F1CF199481296E9C52D358BF7
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0x612A724908EE519876060FBBEEFE189D
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x11A009C0EF8BCB29D73FBF367E3467A8
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0x7BBBDD87A627A8E801F532A73894314D
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0xD78138FDED567F728B15010027F44925
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x1897497FEC378FBFAEBE2F27F96D18B9
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0x74758ACB41A5B1B54ED57273C28EA4F7
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0xEA22B4303270C0FEFAF1EC6B53E76FFD
with her one last word.
0x5096B934CDAABCB087DB9B8A3EB79906

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0xE66470AA128CF84D1C35C74A5ABFC608
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0xB0AD71F7E0455B7E0323B5B6F7C11776
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0xB7782F634C530A1E9C1785CB74F2B188
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xE43279580E98A027C0E3965C62A9B055
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0xD01B04AB1053FFD6A571A37BF99B2FD4
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0x528A41CEC9305385436095E284A5C696
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0xB824440502CF24E1F21065B874818DE5
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0xB6EFB5106695E0961CABE5E54DAE51E6
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0xA4199F0F5A81F59DE378FDFFC725920E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x27CF2093103149484AE3B80C097B4C0E
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0xED23AA6F6BF4AADC54A82C223D684C51
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x0AC54C8B292D8F83D93517EFFA5FAE34
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0xB2AFA6CB5F3D1AD225D200C3F9B09486
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0x0E7A3CE62A35855B2540161616254C8A
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x2C3CB2F32453BB5162F84A4548381C63
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x52A4D3DE627F899DE28CF95F990FC141
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0x45B56195F00FFFFCED751F0BD4E1D5CD
of seeing a corpse.
0x3B6F9FE8600FC7D56BC69B4674B27FDD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0x9D9DCB66D07A5CCC83DF21D908D72372

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x6830CA878EC3C0337791850C11FD28ED
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0xDF48A1C3375ACDCD590BA5C19D0940B4
instantly dissipated.
0xBFEBB3CD41DF4946ACC2D6D3D185CDFA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0xEC564B67998D503E15D1AED0E0A16662

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x0752800E114638AA76B35F2E2FAB31C7
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xE9357361B18C3A0390441F1536B3C046

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0xB488D2B3C52E436EA8A5C2D7D5B7C4A0
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x3F70C1B1B5159B1F1655E695D2D2E7E7
old.
0x4EF288C74EF288C78BBADAEA4018DC28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0xBDE55226AE6A2B9D393CA0D0B23243EE
strike some minutes since."
0x1FB29896AF12E1FD678DCF9EDBACE8E2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0xC352E5B6E47C1A23834524EB0E5084EC
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0xD4B379158F72A126A756896439B8F05C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0x7ACD8DAF58DBD2DEC78E7C8AF572EB0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0xE60D58ABAD3EE2E11EFA9D6D1FB8DF58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x894C97412706274C37A7011D51DE4A2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0x1F9E85FE1F642CED7A06B93F19B6E46F
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x3C398E381FF9DAA5BA6C0916FD870D4A
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x6608CD55C59165B2D4A23A9BF31C0242
whispered--
0x0CE1A33F13269C2FBD47C722C52BC4AE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0x1C2A1D39977F410497E0EF8E7E0F4AE1
quilt."
0xB8AD650CB8AD650CFAA4B3C802FB0751

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0x6B8EE44D9787CB458775893885BA26C1
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x223BF82C493A54080E50F706FA0CD10D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0xB57362EAF326652C76A4C0DC3DBD2385
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0xC47CF615CB97584CD9200E108622AADE
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0x4DE0C9D99ADA49250A8AA0974BF4B088
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x0715E8E57E59F52E96AE8849B5983D29
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xC4B052F08869763B307B6D30FFFF63BB
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x61CFF5B583A72079ABD9E7EBF509DFD3
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0xED03B38EDCBBBCC59DFAAF01EC8093F0
been continually at fault."
0x6EAC3303B2B571A3035D7FAB5AA94BB6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0xC869D18E352CA4680BEEB1E971029BEF

0x641CA27EB89BDADA763DBA436CD15B94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that

region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x67A77634F901D6B590CACD16DCA8D0F5
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0xE8831281B35234FA2220491933817F71
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest

tone--

When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x4A51ED98A5D68A245B6084ACE3795855
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0xE74D0B00917D8A600D878AB7FC65C225
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x6DD17E341F012E5E0A2DAFBC0F81DDAE
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0xF14E650B4C1B9FCA040E9855C800DA1B
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0x158F2D72021D56145FA90A8476E2EE8E
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0xAB50F1F46BBF07D93561329251B9B947
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x5F9A2AC7BCDA3B0C95AC58822AEBB87B
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0x27C2D0BA6A66B056732ADC659D2F9EEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0x91FA055BCF6F65A81D2B9CE9C14CB358
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0xBFB7C410F2D7B49C11A6F588ADF5E33E
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

CHAPTER X
0xCC384EA73D894A246308724EA63CE09C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0xBC7899B94C5DC9DC8BD9D6972878D6D0
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x6315CD6C98D6B2B287E0C1335BB1E2D1
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x33AC4B6986A2DAA5A4008929830041AA
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x19ED77F74A944CEDB11E0739A4218F76
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0xDFEE705687CBEA053DBAB19E5A8C278E
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x15F9C3FCD794D549F60B44401B927E9A
connection.
0x6D9E491A8D560218ADA7E479023AEC27

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0xCB5D631B70A641B91CBAB30E2EAD5D3D
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x5743B310DC48FFE692E7E0A34F5FB097
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x948DE5B269887D34FB16591B1F08FF17
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0xD893E42F51ECD60111E0B88FA8B8B5D1
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x310AFF1533C5B9FE1B76BBEC450FA0DC
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x2B2329D4D7780406CE3E3B571B349916
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0x96A6467468566789384C629C97D84D2B
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x21E13494AE88EDF9747998AB33636A9B
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xE8D22A39A668BCE14BD680DD4A0D0F33
beneficial to the institution.
0x91CFE41A635990218B9034AA969535E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0xAC41A262606C7E96654FB4E972D41BA8
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x627799015DB5791CAF810DAF3C8D6AA9
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0xB41EF3DE3C5B76A42500BFDD560B870D
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0xFD23E7F7F8F50C8BE09C4F287C373B7B
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
0x92F6DD29A994703BC8A1ACE418C7DEEE
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x6D817F3C3DC73BB8CC0B5C634BF78D92
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0xEA14BA46D341500CA6358EC6EC0B235B
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xC7046166196C6C6C2AB2198FA74AB12A
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0x397E2B18B19808C437ECCD023AA2BB45
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x263AF7D3D72C85361A24691966A4EE29
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x0AD281FD12D65B1400F99B3ED1A240FD
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0x1376A1A774E9E807B964241EA30106C4
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0x27C0419D2D7A56A2FF4B8CF5B470F012
testimony to its value and importance.
0x722E630E674EBE3D8F8A7372A9203FD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0xE2364DFBC0C265FCC5C019C5C2947323
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x68C3C79D5B67B01994D1CB5EEC8B8A19
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0x107A10B7DF5C0440C70E213EFBB88903
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0x3006345BA2E3EFBF32865A874410CA56
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x64815251093A474A9ACA2BABF606F146
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x91AF9E8923EB6B5B140C866336443882
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0x7C06335DCAF1221FB63AE941F465F696
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0x716148748E3462CB11B90CAE71EE0B66

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0x762A44C810C4FB649CDE66C17A99FDE9
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x1D21C33D3CC5CE7F016E6D91CBCF051D
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x282924F8700640E1D8371206CE5F14EA
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0xD16DFAEA68615AE144F30AA385E7D0FA
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x25D23A2BFD2D21B6987F1126153B9D17
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x58B97DE91A03A172E3DED2FB128DB9B8
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0xC3A56F29DB374B23DBACE470183F7326

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0xFFFF1FBD2BF8FB2F12596AAF07BB4CA3
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x81358AA1795AEF3690155B352DF915F0
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x344E9FF2D05E0C7B4AB4BB8682EE5911
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x86AB83EF44CAA274B761EA3581C3AEF4
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0xA0DB62218FC621CC629A946AF5A47B9B
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x891965DD45B4D0631A7A8A9903131A6C
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0xFAD743B403CC5A9CCDA993C85A667BBB
character.
0xF8DFBFC8D4A6DBDEFD1C510F5D9DABCB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0x4FA85EA1641112926F5D2DA0B4C2A421
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0x92B91C538693E6317FD06C3FF90448E7
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x0F1EBF61718A5AD15971CBB5A8B511DF
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0x5E27B9FB0384504D426DA5CEFA75CA01
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0xC00AD07561272FA7CFBD904D2B8886EA
of the occasion.
0xA4D45F9F05F3C132BD16EE29841C2A50

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0xC994240A3DEDCF56F375AB4D761E735D
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0xC5D29B4F20837007B3E5B49CC6805483
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0x41D920FB59F8AE431BC73E77181162A1
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xEBC45EA7B6A10AAA01F66C7F9C8338AA
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x5A0C7C9454890D6E56218C10A3CFAB18
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x8577E3B324BB33EA31DDAF4C1E23B316
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0x707B69616686316EED3E0F97712A34AF
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x75AAEA9FC2F219E4364DB18F603AA1D1
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0x61262797EE1C6422DC8FD41249D796E8
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0x45CFBDF13DB54E8C46080056D4392B6A
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xA409799439B4DC14F5BF7DE61BFA8DF8
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0xD5675A4DEF7260A242CD35345B8BBF04
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0x50DEFEE73294652FE020D63287F17956
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0x50B8ECDA16B1490DA375E9DA0F398F90
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0xBB88943FCB01C0DA5B7442B137B1A1EF
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0xEA21AB050194E2A6263349045191EC71

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xB11A5EBC9F0BAC831719167ED694BDE6
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0xA7C0E3BB6567466EBA760AD760376053
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x55C9556307510E9E6D7897BB1CB61BF7
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x66F4B3F39AFCCB97446BB6196EFBBEE8
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x669FD54A14F1787B0BF84F916213B34C
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0x68B9BDD6A183B99B481A6DC20E223408
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x4D99228CE332E033C7103981E9F23DD4
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0xB40F45ECC69C093E5E60726A314E2984
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x41D43BBE727A3A248921A3FFB2866661
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0xD93C4D83E109F2620EBCA72EB76A2217
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xCFC2B3CFC531418FF68DFA35A38F88AC
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x8A00D9BB37E7BDB722BCDEF4B380BE72
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xEEB8CF00D2F70E44B991D061EB27432B
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0xF57AE0C29FCE5749B2D83551280DEDD8
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x3D8718678D15569B5D5190DF19D7F280
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x073DB1A81B33AC15C26AFD6E0B2C8497
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0x63A40314D103DD0F3F77989CE9A67AAE
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x1EEEF4A8ACFCF2A7061AF7D8AEA76660
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0xE9912E8FD3955B31DED7DE5B7266A6EB
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x0EC536CD51EC67AFE6448227592CCF6F
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x651FEE4366F62BAF5B812F68D912ACB0
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xA11E3580AA2A51F15BC97060355E13BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x9087CE3A9B10C21F1BB5C104A1329CA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x02898077222C7E05E9F4D4540D91716F
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0x36619FF075D4D71141AE95C6A034564D
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x7821B453B493EE5753643BA0ACA59826
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x629604AAC76388630EF703D4E81ACF25
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0xBEC621D6C2089C0B209583276A0A04BE
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0x9BAC7C746387266127951472D7061475

Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0x220A2AC7064215C0EC982A155C506B32
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0x062659B27CD0B0B73DE6F06F45F8D3C6
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x5BDCAC540380EDF1FB82C74B706FDE0F
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0xFA08F09766DDA643EA27F1DC2B21AC51
instantly revived.
0xDE58FD5A7EC606348952FC41899A4937

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0xE1AE6B1E03C61F53BF7B114D92F0693D
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0xB549F1C8E7D7C8801769B52B57FA8A96
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0xEE7C2FF0C2E0DF62FFB4123951D030A1
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x627E6F909F42EB8622ED676B58A802C5
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0x7DC9D843B247A0A7DE97E1F6BD04525E
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x4990D9A913618384DF20BFDB6BBDE518
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0x8F1F3404C79F4911FE1FAAF350020938
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0xC9E3A82CE7F1E02E6A9FE9B43615B3F8
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x43A4E9AB4FF8265BF2C1A435220CD5BB
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0xD4AB8A65494DC407AF9C8151ED4B7572

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0xB7864B1ED1B2F9D92CAF83C327B90E06
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xC33232D51FEE5722711777558F3FFBE5
think_ again with all my might.
0x4F1ED13BB747FE49AD1192F827156449

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0x048256C2F712FC3705090254DFC73F04
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x63883636BE56D30582CD60B017727AA5
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0xCFDC44401124052CFF7D0A4E948839AD
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0x3AB769CBC817EF0C21709D25E6949B64
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x510FA23E402F63EBC3889022E17F7F9C
their resource?"
0xF819D9EA59BB777452D0500314DA4C12

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0xE7A0BD808DC9312BAD3DCC91FA5999CD
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0x87B0D63F8538CA530CF0C52CB80AEEB3
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0xEC75658126A3C2304BF9A2C80C4053DB
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0xDB303BA5A3AB513DD1207C2085A7817F
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0xC3C81512CAA2768934C137D056DF5E1E
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.

A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x86DD9A25E71475191AB1D78EC077C11B
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0xCC1A1380FCFAEE586EF2304ADF8C7FD7
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the

This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0x0119DCAE1D0B6EB3EB29C9267503EA13
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.

With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0xCC8522445A2AD3BAA7E7A6880C4F1870
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0x6168F8AD12586780493A142D8C36276F
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0x026320883798537C72808ED141C50030

education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0x74B3DA062893F2D183D7A25EF5A5AA59
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0x0540D05A8DE25158F9E3F353CCAAC9E0

This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0x0CD273CE1FF1BAA7F7DFC9A7F78749FB
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0x6C0ACD63B5208113910AFB5092DC95A2
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0xCED36D5B2E30935EB871794A33B2D219
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0xEF7E2A465FF61B80F520E14504879538
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0x07893BB4CE69B91DDED995CEC1D51F03
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x49B0A35F75C555C87EBBF0F8F28E97C7
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0x169FA9CECE5F9A360C6D12F734A75006
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x40C6EE075628E7A87C3A9406EFB1B9EB
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0xFA8D9E6D9E4918E23B8CAC76FE5976A8
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x215AC3D91A05D2823243336DC36FC7AE
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0xC2657DBE95CDD2A742A60126436714BB
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0x62B0217D2994791F6DF63B4D8AF9496D
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0x1451AD3AEF22304BEEB38C28AAE19E56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0xCA890F72F6E075D6F4EAC0F8429D8293
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x834E0278290B9E56AA5C9A4ADBC8569C
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0xA297A8379C0272E976A987AF6C637DAD
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0xC4F8A9463811C1D1F02B2DCD000CC33E
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xE4B153EB2083085E07781DA86FC3FE4F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0x49B2A2C62408A9F7E7D88D05F575A4ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x6CB08B10A891FD12DD37C67D9613D1B9
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0xDEB9DD85863C8B1AED3674611C04B6FE
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x2EE663BEC4B96D753FC86FF35A77FD25
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0xEB979BCBD3BAA87F3352E51B5F7F3973
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0x0CC02212D7FDCB77E26CAB9AACD25186

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0xF608400DCFF5434986237D377C020A72

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x7E82E2E98E3A6E6AD794DCB6DDB75865
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0xF805E91A0EDF2BB9FC0C02925D8F585C
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0x9A078289D98DA14A98A77CC48AAD79F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0xD692CA9B0C3CB7B8162EAEACDA67E0E3
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0xFB75E34ADF7DBAABEE67E9C380D6D743
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0x2341FFB72BA3377EC29663C61D992A1B
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0xD9EA411145745DDEC23CEE7239C36B15
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x7FD6D27B032E024BB385C0DCF8276C6C
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0xABD6D87FD3F71F3B9062CCDA8E402138
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x677C6D6CED8BD878751C677BCCAE5C3E
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x6D0B893472B16262546DED1A6728572A
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x71E82EF203F6A9A5F95B29B3DCBC0651
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0x9818E443121B1BA6AF9BCFEC9782BBE2

"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0xF3D78B3981DD0DF6652264FEB378400D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x6F019F03FD01F9E151F727F1B97AFF7D
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x622A8B7B979A8695DC437FF9820FCBB7
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x52B3D40BF10F2ABF02D3E43C31A014A9
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0xC83770AB790D29C36CDC277E2F349931
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x0184B6D6D462CF26A00120DA140A288D
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x5FB7BCF26B4E1095CE0110A896D8FC5C
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0xB0FE7278A4EC86C36031AC8456E058A7
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xD42A32342434E8969BE63FE6F61EE432
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x16170FD886AEEB3464E0236668FBFEB2
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0x4877B89F9172B7D334B1B8ECF013C579
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x42CA3EEACE15E5B163633E821C882DA3
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x6AB0DEAE2AE2789AAE2F9408634DFDD5
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0x8BEA3B14901B0B77AAF98542B3415795
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x56CF42B5C0DF2A2545FE9A2A2DB86EF5
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x1786382D18443D4889893D12A72393BB
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0x3EDBE65BAD8969C31DD88B6CD8A6C831
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0x5F18F0F9D10EA7634A917281A9418D62
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x9494DCCE03A1A7F16733789DE5B969D0
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0x07E654739B6627BC455131F45CAE6046
probably, be a good way from the town."
0x92434E258E5CFA465FA72CAB0FBEA4C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0xC28E8EDAE4D1AF2127A7CE79A854582A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0x52A36450872133CD3F5058E1FDF6653E
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0xCAFAE39892A54BBEAEB6171D448A1BEA
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x6D3357B28A62604FBBF269E6DEE7C3DD
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xF81997AAC5FE08880306C5888A386EBF
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x9C81F66D9CA21E6D0B55095EF1C72637
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0xF017697E62E7A87B581F0C9565691D1C
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0xB22E3AC5BFEF66FD752DC2DD00F62707
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0x297CEFAE5E12585768054D9661F99B46
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x92FFAD8CDE2F9E66FA14E66FF9B08B7D
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0xB99C6C741597A5CA00869CEA2B433819
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0x8F40F95DC6BC2B6EE8BC28F16549341C
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0x137A1B8BBBF19F18F48C22926BA289FA
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0x104E62F53300BE6663D1335D0565845A
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x58BB8AF4843698E1652457CA92FFD982
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xE0E910881FF2BCD6421BE8D06B74306F
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0xBCBD0F6FE22E1E2967C54BBF1F2FC8BF
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x64E19DA09C42026C1F41B03848560A41
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0x0B21FD65C806222222666832CBA927E4
forthwith be furnished me.
0xFDAC61E5C989804A28DBB3F426683571

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x1B6CA0EAE92E9EBC0849EC2BD588F098
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0xE26A7D75C4ECEA09BE63A9BD47E88C1D
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0xB8AA23A925989B5ED898DF295E62E3E3
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x120D385C82B50E732CE00BF88FFF124A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x8B59B551301025C7FDC78569E3B234D0
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x3B35D387D27BA07FBE58C6678249D7D9
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0x11513149EF44CD01319532A8A698CBD7
years ago from Gateshead.
0x3283EB9DA55C221D021D8B2B98425A5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0x5DC8726521E3202B2FB8312AE3DD9647
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0xF45D23C5CB5E1A4BB191A6899E9C00AE
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0x7C5AC8A4A3E3DD684D44B26C34EEFBDB
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0xDDE18A1BA1D6D47C43FD2AC3816DFE74
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0xC405D47A609FDF0E459CA1FC6BF77B5D
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0xEEDE4525DC1C93293321A1D03FDAE9DF
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0xE4E3D61857595651BA6A78C17CBDBD0F
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xBDDCB77034341435CA386D21CD8AF6E5
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0xE2BEC05CEC2711C102EFE5166B399FBC
while the change was being accomplished.
0x388C5742DAB6604284AF2C7D990DBB3E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0x9D70CF38D55B0A7B783A8BAEB77809A7
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x8D385A3AE6FC16EF9A882DE63C45D40F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0xF69EEE1914F5FF606EB3E50609E33E9F
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xE128499B66F2E6DD716D65A016F8CD74
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x5B64B49D3016BE299A50B202BF0A8689

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0xDA582328F2B52063B5158BA0929BB593
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0x6B20E5C5BD1F8280DABCA719AAE883AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0xC5027C3E6DE960F2D5B0DBE2D20E7930
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x00998F41E0C1A84BAFD8A602EB107542
complexion.
0x83EEDF2AA1557D1A650FC080FA3F11A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x8B8A2C4DD1C5230FE8DC50B0E5A5C69D
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0x0E6F9F2045C8A0921F7B79BF467C8FC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0x10CEF43A6AC2B280441E6C164DF6AA7B
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0x490FC44FA22008779285525DF595CC17
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0x51C6D538607C784D9E2C9B18833AE0A3
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x5B5DCFCE6CD24A4F3D4751BE70ACD43F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x60D7F5229183B8DDABEEBCAF503BC800

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0x6395BFF7262EA62D45D5E79C2E662DF2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x1CEBFA788B5DEC99A051907843608981
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0x7E643B3B77051310806A2DFC26B950C8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x9F81E9548D214F5417FC5957DD8697F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x27704BF0E1C8717EE26284EB9286E935

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0xDE57C34996754D899A65783375A38DD6
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0x2308ECD04A9BD1B8F77673C2A629C84D
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0xCAEBBAEB06A5B7E1A716EA6A0342CAFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0x301EB392F102F0CBE0842D370EC1FDD8
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0xBB7A79275CDA344F07F73A7999013779
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xE9368F36B46CB64F3F67083DE43F4B51
would make two of you in breadth."
0x9E2A56F4F5A8D2F7D91F2D5AD995EFB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xC428D7DFBD1ECC1DD3B9DB62AA309E9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0x2F9E30EF1C6E1710C7154E0802E08AEB
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xB67A62BA61C9B8521151D4EB94212CC9
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0x49226955EBAD1E4DC01C2346D920530A
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x050A98F88B51095C4F379A58F7C023B8
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x1EC228A06009102E5C89C5CF7D47C33E
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0xCA2AA41E106434D032842277E17E9472
quarrelling--"
0x7557344F8F4CD2C73F20E8709BEA619F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x57EBE2DBB84635B303BE4B24CD4289F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xC1CFE1489FE81922EAE2B8ED8F621E03
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x670185573A8FF2A6292E6865F3E0AD8B
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x797CC5EDF901D41D8F5639CAA7F196DC
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x9CBAD79E2417DF74892FDB301572693D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What does he look like?"
0x6E664DA7A73651EF90895956366E5442

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0x8B4CCD4CF7844B066783D710CB4DB52E
has such thick lips."
0xD0868C4FFE75DBA8AE278CBFCDBFFBDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x949A3C8A1F1522A9E80E0E729F8C1EFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x83AD98860EAC25D39C54A0AF3841E0CB
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0xB9344CE810D8B08BAF9BD8CAD5A13ADE
a deal of money."
0x73E1B7CB2383A14D0BE83DA7A3B1A1CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0x7F1359B7B9AC4CCCE73B48F2BC7BCC0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0x6075F5991D1DC9315F53B8F4D36C6AF5
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xF331D144C7FE35FED29F7FCABC605197
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0xFF8916A088100BBF7164A644960D2F6C
you were quite out of my reach."
0xAD239487A088864E8AD430190017D5D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x3D20989BEBE390AEABE3C8EAE3229422
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0x162BDE930DE0540EC965D4E916BF3D67
shape denote admiration.
0x0C6C137758479821D29E0C7AB04B3833

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0xB877FA259727021574EF28E6A34F94FE
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x90117EF48951F61D9922B7F18D9B24E2
a child."
0x8B2B8546DF2693180FE0195838FFA2C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0xE4E8C5FFFAE6D73726071D11B4D3E160
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x08E4A437F1B72D7F0C67A9DC9FB7EFCA
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x421D704AF493D42B51B557F96B00BA17
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0xD00085342B643764E3B41C21636B1C3D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0x445CA6FC6F91B613A1661FE310EFE467
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x08C352F098975B8DACC8907375B59A74

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A little."
0x4119887E46290CF1617DDDBF1B920197

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xAA7655EC477D367C385EE734E04E76BC
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x27E05C8BA399269C9BC683818106CF3A
charmed.
0x159181C49944B85BAB59036E000C56E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x59D8FF670AAC726AA6701AF51683ACCB
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x8E0446B308F42B985115989B6C628F85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0xA58393651D119CB42CF05C31EDD70EBB
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0xF8898AD029E982D4625B9C2787273434
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0x048838CD80E50E057974375BB3B7B498
and which she had framed and glazed.
0xFD9058799302EC066256EDA35B7EDC0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x3AC3E222AF789A01C03765DA75DCDCE7
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0x01514A11F0A02444A9F0D4E4EDF15029
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0xBA5D60E0D9513111C01A6BFFF79B2D82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x4CDC6ABC6A2EACD14E13ADE6A6295235

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0xECF7915AC85DC00CD6EA49D8E11DE50B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I can."
0x16ADD58D58D562285D170C358FCBEA25

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0x63977668E6CF2C26C8C3A8F0226D331A
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0x0116CFA4839A8BD5A3761BE5976A8AE2
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x920603908BBF7D21E5C91CD5602CF674
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0xDA8AF185F3775B77D2C74A171E099E76

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never in my life."
0x185C9F74D835D16A55182C603E448AA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x8BC877652581CCF66DE5FB63786DEB4C
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x51B21D9E77746F922DEC4E82A017FB0C
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0xC8A62C97ACEC8E1131475F45FD51B140
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xBDAFB7512D8382A3EBBC5CF918609418
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0xFCECE27CDAA385C9B56D8F4171D3C5A7
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xDFB8D98055C6DF58A4555576BBB9BC0D
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x23D7FB25479FE627A0F22584DFD9BF62
father's brother."
0xB7A71389484C39B7D300286AF6DAE7EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x9C1341969A9AF4D738AB70A1709B4B61

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x110A1E9D549838545AC6EF0DD85AAA66
tell me--"
0xAF288DFD079CC340B1FFD9F7AF8A27F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0xF0092EB954767323A0134E0C6B2C04F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0x95CAA60C42A5736A9151E4CD0F07EDD9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"So he went?"
0xA77BF7D88D4578EBE2EE8759A5663C08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0xBFB3825C6557DF46A08B1D087EBE4618
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x9F814A3D0BADCC6B703E1548A6A4BEA1
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x573BB6F785170B97B88A24D3CB9C2E01

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x55A88FB25F87192033930810DE26E5E3
wine-merchant."
0x62C673083D9CA8B3B75A73597EA9921D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x76992EBCF65BCEEA804AB949DE066DE9
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xC81ADCC359C0069CFD9CD6142CA8286C
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x697CA361CD00D4221A325DEB1F0671BD
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xFFE90EDA6F529F607B8B671D1D081A8D
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x7AC6F9DE3264DD6515B71FB6C0EAEEC9
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0x660D4E3BEC6CFD6688B4183FA28526C0
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XI
0xE14B215753555797C2FD937FB841DE56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0xEEA77992B8AE288F5110D612941A53FF
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0xBDEDC43BCC16CEBBE25C0CBC3F9B57B7
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0xB1876D3E4C35D238819B8D223CFD6A91
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0x2B64F46BD083AE99391E7B2BC364B4AE
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x3486DAA8219D1102D46393A6FA5241D0
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x27B6D2B11E242F37C1AC0762E5BF46CC
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0xF009ACFF6787B4149D8E54FC353E1C85
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0xCF1BE0A459034DE15923C725E697DEDF
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xD383D66A9FC8053C68D5ADD609887EDE
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0x4FF6C3E7AC44193A07513359B1A18F77
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0x0CA3DBB6BC2DDB538A7394C424FF1AB5
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0x6DF58DD4FFF8BF858278163D85991AB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0x5B959202097F3F1442BD13AA813E55F0
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0x89A9F42913AE8DBF02C541AE4016453F
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x106659452264D1ED29BDAC96D0F778D7
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0x9954759F3357EDA96A0788C37C763208
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x4592C9322252CC077B363B70C42468C0
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x8D8EE3D89B3C4CC6D934FDC874A60BD3
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0x9A9E6F5F6B8593CCCC4698657553B2EC
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0xA3C899EAE5E157A8CD1B9A4EE08423E9
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xB9F763CB3CC6D80BBA77F78AAF56776B
troubling my thoughts.
0x463ECA9E153336D7716BC119EA0B7E34

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0x5F81D51E6DBAF720A4B35A809A3ABCFD
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0x0E291B531E2A33DE42E9EA0A0FDCE597
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0x7562026EEEAC5F522C0FB613825055F8
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0xD17C26BF5AB0886D093A6ED21AADFC99
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x557820DF6ADF7E53FB3720D5F6ED7849
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0x1D0245F0DEAC7E40B3BA79DB076A6DA2
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0x37280BBC5C6F76AC3D4FC63E09A83976
the bell.
0xD5E2DDF37481968C3C4333829F3D07F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0xC9A072FCEE24FA3572E4B31EC596620D
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x19E7908726B8D81BF2BA83DBE517CF83

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x6C6FD872179321C2CD530F18DD4EEE8F
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0x551D352CD01DB4F327CA1545DE354F19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x8477E73C38CBD467B8A5B06E070C7FFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Person here waiting for you."
0x359C21D4EF5A4A2098ABF87949FA67C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x40F9CD373B53285CCB7184280D970C53
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x282CD80C2A8AC39364B32E9C4ADB1688
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x6B94AF7196C5172F741CADFB55A1E873

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0xFA9334627BC219CB127D0FD70482A7D9
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x44C80DDB3E0F427684870C8E23819F0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x2899182B114E96C75B97B14E091CC21B
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xDC7B0B4A7B491E199F1366DAAF5FAD90
Thornfield.
0x7211A33F32CAD71BC01FC9FF58042550

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A matter of six miles."
0xC2B9AFEFF6E07CC32AF4ED82264D7A28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0xF064972CD2B6E9C76208FFBE9277D27D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x461AE3471A69F148F1DCF1BDC134D6FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x47E7BBC4722AD3E646FF7037448642B1
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0x97B288F6085ACB579B0ED8DD5E56FE10
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0x64697BED65CE506C84700E2E860895DE
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0xC97E6FFC6799DA17BB4B207ADA645C9B
much at my ease.
0x11BEA1355E0DCED6124CB88967A64152

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0x4FFF9E7EE51B3886B5C2E474A9A8365E
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xE2BC3434F71DB0C7A6E5B52377C8CB91
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x6D70945D2EFBF0EC510ADC6482099E8F
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x465E81344DDA9E930DC42424900D61EE
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xF47BBD83173D67ED05825B1D84B5C00F
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0xF58215A2C468332F7C35D3AAD2174DED
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0xB6481F77582EBB4646CA0709DFB32CCE
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0xF1872197E2826295F3A965B3A4812F5C
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0x04BBA13772723B4DFDFF9DD23C3229A7
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0xF2A757A281058F9FEE777704DBBF9621
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x53D8FE90A21199576E30F27B750CD0F7
road now, I wonder?"
0x1017C333143E7BDF399917B96AF4AFB0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0x3C5E69BD5C4650E6FA3590BB3250286C
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0xD24299C3A5AF69514994A69EBD1A49FF
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0x40B8A1AF5C79279D0B2605BB7498CE8C
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x4B391BCB6ADA5280F6F2295716909B0B
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0xFA73C76EC073E7CFD18B9B3B27D6A1E9
more stirring, less romantic.
0x23628F18C90EEBB62FD9ACC70F2B4C4E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0x88F1F5239CD9960E9764EF41456A90F6
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x73C6B6A4ACF214CCEF3008946B8F9ADC
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0xC58A9A6F9BF617E45FB36E33310DABB4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x1330261468BBAECC37CC35FBAA6B58F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x8C7B359A2D98AAA65F3A43C199A4474E
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0x084FCA6D3D6C2865929112A08CFC50A9
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x2A9D4E88910751D1BFEF9971EB65994B
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0xB1EEA594B0F1B1109EFC95CEFFF3BB13
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x8B8135A1D361A2BFEDE6470D65E38E00
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x6AE031EC2312982336E656FBE758C864
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x152D7AEF253FC68386C4C90E78E02B33
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0xBA71F8A15DBA23BD035B1038D0F06B51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0xFC2DF70EDAE58323EDF02430C0A191C9
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x5D30ABDD60EEE26BFF22074EA22FE4E0
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x255DC673ED9860CA199CB2447B6A99C7
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x6A42FB678CAA69BA3D62E79AC256C820
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0x0F6DD791E9DD880B879469D667BC62AC
itself to my view.
0x7AF59B212988B91C41F18D191B0AF584

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x196336A89B2A233E4CB2E7FAB3AEAE5E
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0xC784BCF7C42B49B4D120F0294F1F5A03
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0x0F936328124F531C7E9FAFCC48E7ED03
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0xC87C2A26C4BE3BC2B39793BB0D75FDDD
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0xD3CC71BAAB4A34CDB7769F1DEEAD0614
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0xAD2C59A112EFB1EBFC8D204DCCF75C85
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x3B84A4F4E8D58B651E65EE7CB78646FC
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0x898522DAB90C9D55BF60EBCBB055F491
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x3AA0B37F8051FA64FE18CB18F4B57193
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0xD4CAA56A7CD1D0BB42E1A317442405B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xCE62971AD5B2A6E2D0AD59ECC9B2E4F3
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x59B85D70DBF070336A5B8359CAD34281

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0xE8B275FF978430420A78CD2039F212C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0x827789031CD52F7BD47C85D04EC52B95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x22D78D6654E53BBCCE974CAFFE76F4CF
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x529EB928F62452BDD54348114FE9037A
trouble.
0x0C7BE5C2AB2E9DC8AE862CB13FCA0E8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0x8D592477EBE67055829BB6865B696849
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0xFBAADFE75402F9551D738869747AD03A
the keys of the storeroom."
0x671A2708FDF88BCD43AA67FE76719D13

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x73C05967F328CF2296D282D6BC22E1AA
delivered them to the servant.
0x679E1F7F536BA51FC8A9670CC06DCD0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0x5F47F4CC6F369D81E299074B2531D5BB
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0x50AAC00CF478797497BF74EAB4163317

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, ma'am."
0x133D00CA14A84EA558C11C547A272039

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x7EF7A4C5494DB41172E4862F328EB0CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xD520B6EF39A3BE1190EF78560769AD77
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0x36C68D656ABC060BEE8A03D795A232BF
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0xF386EA0E2B8B0FC9E59D75942B68D1A9
too soon."
0x391AFBD730A94DC02EE87577604D25BD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0xC34EE7E2BCE9AAE8741C945CBB4FC75D
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0x221D17D0F8E650E2367FB9CB44CCD42E
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0xFBEE0D5CFE6937FB080E6093AE573B27
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xF3245F57B3BAB4699F0E286EB8DEE63A
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0xB970FE19B0DFF747F253C1C72F628EF1
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x6BF9123C714DD3EF369A460C8EFC0F19
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xF9E68D1AB124A248E7BE7B9DE4186FB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x8EC58220C9AF5AD8E64623C494DC4183
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0xE32BF5865BB26D1AF3274C7DD6737769

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0x0CC90B40754C07CB93D630D0EF22E30E
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0xD7317DBB25ACD582C5E1231C95DDB6E2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x957AC99949E28781E05BB6DBE8FF69A5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0xC4826424B5F27D3CFF7E56B897529E34
future pupil."
0xDA0965609EDBD6F3F9AFDA7FB6A19070

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xCA0F115246D2072862BCF9E7C3F0ED1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No,--I have no family."
0x727DC6DE5ED356CF617234A280CE0212

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0x778081B6B8053FFF77EC19C189397241
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0xEBB20EA3338F3F318D3E4F8F12F02322
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0x3918B6F37A0896C3606471D4FDF22F70

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0xD7B50FE7482150B85101FA29039E1C18
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0x22EEAE9E4904C3B7251C511F4F0B94E2
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0x30D72BE8733C74BB2439D1202CE1E277
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0xC05B4DB9173C41430565D1E770828FDD
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x0400A9C5CC4FC8F472DCB13EE18AB0E2
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x76B8237EE8F3CA7C9CB7268C7E29C338
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0xC3AA119222F095A96A49B27A19BA1A25
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0x7EC6060B59AA3A0FFC910C457F507B7F
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0xFFF5F35C6CE9A696EBE585F3CC28FD69
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x1D2352E675E0222A2D7E194611C5886D
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0x391C24B1CD4D2E07A0CD327266A44F00
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x27BCD851CCEED473BFC871ABD7FE4CA7
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xE08AB12E5819CD13CF3B4CC1292F5A43
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x6B262E4323F4BC38142FB8558EB308A1
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xBE7DDA1B28F4B3B2D15B63157292E8A0
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0x4B1C34A7C758D5F54EC0F312504308B0
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0xE8A2D623044E675838F7D6C176CA8015
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0xA18B35F94903C1D1DF8884C510AFA97D
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xD2611A9497E63A99E508F04B1ECEE69B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x8E5F81BBA8A6BF2D4D16F20B87B2BE22
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0x8C9F953055103F35415E17ECC93E84C4
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xF9CFDE329C85FD7103E67DAAF8E242D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x19B1E53ECF97DE0D70A30AF59A998404
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0xA52AE9E5713FAEB4F8824A432E360E96
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xB72AF79D97ACE129EEBE684887984AC4
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x293BBFA42AD61CCF42C5D6CB1C207726
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x41FAB0B501C9B81ECEA7549756497621
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xB2EFAAB0DECC6DA12B3DB9C1179BFC1E
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0x2C069EC496886BBE475B675AB3047B3E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x5BB94156908D67F118784775DA5FD9A8
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x70047BDEB243C27DBBD060E01B6FCBF8
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x0C16F09E294A01DCB258825816F8B57E
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xEBED722EAB6F2DCC1EC4572FC5787C63
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x0F237DC68E2F321C5CEBE5A8DBDD617B
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0x509DB36ADF4C57D0771ABD25F2D1EFBE
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x6241DA406601A60C14A391BB9A5D80A2
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x0B750E08C2EC652901B861B1604F74D4
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x088924A66F9183BC41B1D6FA9432CCA1
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0x893C3E343D46617022560A1FB72BBB3B
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0xE6B2E3B42AFED69677E07EAB31E1C5F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0xDAFAB0686C349D4609F723D10105C64A
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0xBEF066B112E35C4A5254E94C6413138D
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xD51C0CD9BFEF87546503CA18C2CE7BC9
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x06046F9E924F0BCD07EAEC368C86CC25
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0x7BB038678CED1852B94BDF1A121D5535
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0x6C615FE798B75602B084279B0A079636
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x7DB3EF2F5F5583EA708546D74CCD804A
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0xBDAF8F5281BA624CAED9D04EEFC909CB
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0xF392F9E5A48F3CFADF44B7A0FDEA956A
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0xB1F28E02FF99A9801AEE81C3D2D6B1AA
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0xA564D9789B1923BB3BE6B83984A89E1E
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0x5C150A714A4360121CD47D5CB2F6B005

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x5C8A50744A79FE539E7BB0C30203ED0C
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x1B633CAFFB31BFB4C942AC99EA470C0E
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0x00205DE91FED871C198CD1451D1CDD5E
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x3729A7F6839CA6606B29DCC3FB5DD740
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0x98A4908AF0FB676F7C56478E50411ACD
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0x4ACCDC18970CE97C21060DF0555E24E6
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0xAD6208789A9ED70342A2649241995382
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0xAF29E9EFFE920F182CF24EAEBD33CB95
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x0F24A6C84F6BE11161BB34887BE10460
an indefinite future period.
0x7F0A48EC6BE66069AD0CEA7EA2368570

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0x33028F7F88A78CD55CE4CF4E669BE998
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0xB217FB2C05D3605C303197D3D70C655E
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0xB06F35DA265AF7210BD07447A4CBB27F
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x3AAAB6A4B633D31E963811B0A33C2C46
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0xB448B7767F242DA6997DDA34BB4129B9
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x8012D3FD0ACC71D5EF791E4BADF64951
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0x8A5E663D29B331DEFAF718489A62770B
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0x8A937DA236FF3A3B0B305BC2E0C530A0
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0xC16EBBEB5B63ACDC28976647D997B2BE
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xE401CD48D5D8526F52B03FAC42B51E36
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0xA41B050038A7B5D9B79415AD6BAA28C0
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x4F85434BCEF239D3D7B12E767B2C7F0D
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0xB65ACF463905FEBD00EC1D8A63962F4D
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0xDD66367D4A739C7DEBEE9C41D012814C
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0xBF0A721B13259EE242A269AF6AF96393
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x67165E01A07CCCC68B642DDD7B71EDDB
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0x584B4458ABD4AE3D6BF1546E43D50E9E
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x957625E3DD5D6375766F0FE3168DE283
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x3DCB040FC19428A2353C32527DA1F680

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0xA272510DBC43D327896BD0690ED0E83F
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xED15C8A2F6E71C9D22B9FD69C7909750
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x60A7F13E148AD167AC598DC57D9FAB49
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0xEE8E08BDB7B3FFA26F72C97C023121EB
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xCF232E7DC1031ACA2CC3F7F5E8440BF1
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xAE119B91240E5442C82B418A3B600AA1
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0x1F673219683DB51A268A0B1DD9DF0886
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x4F866CF24D164AF9A0A549B0AB82C48A
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0xB52B5E058FBC064DDF44871262594C7F
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x6FA21CCEE091017A61F1DC958E441CC5
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x2BE811098536ECE4DD71EA2BA13CCD2E
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0x38DC6BACF76D0547BCDF3610E9EBA06A
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x444CCBC7980B9C7F816F3499D031CD08
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x1FF1F60C76F8C3D2B074DA1F110002E4
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0x288469504FBE6D9DD0CCEF10B369AC88
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0xEB661E7B4BB297975ADEE398604BB136
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0xDBA997D1A9501E743333CF4D0207DBDB
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0x40D8688036715133CEEA55A934B670FD
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0x91C5AA85D2ECFC9EC3FC277A5D2F0A00
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0xCE0B83532B4A815AEB97B5388E5D7134
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0x89538EABC7043906064DCA948FC5F97A
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x2168D2F2AEF14E1587BB63AE23F27CEF
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0xB8757C178BBDABD2EC36859C1E497E0D
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0x2B0684439DC44687BC75C2DE0A4070F5
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0xAAD7D5F50B663554E84AB56EB70537F7
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x698A4957988559325A7DED201BDB9798
house and gates.
0xE18063E52F8B7F35252B739D0240C81A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x4F907164849A9CC0CD9E466A6F23CD4F
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0x43A257542367A90B79AA5C55F7074F2B
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0x73F1DFA08DAFC8D1567A1B9CC201B967
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xF707358B6753626FC573E1B292C9D6D5
appeared at the door.
0x014E2C7AAA4152E77C4F4D19D6571C7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0xAD9960CEA17D794A3FDCED62A6CD6B87
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0xFF4AE36AD7488C34AC31DFFD332E87FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x1EF7EE40EAEB8D97D1450E536C4555EE
much.
0x6468DCB16468DCB1654A5E5E7C2F1F84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x592632B562367CBA1DF2C1AE3C5936E6
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0x596A71FB32DC2D86CC841A947971C252
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0xFCA8FACA002113949F0F2A7A323360E3
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x5A5FC7459A120FC7B1E8BDDF1FDB5BEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x443CA6AC84B2DEB6E1AEB6300C165287

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0xD152ADFFF6FEA995377D46BF81100ABC
was called Rochester?"
0x942939D53D2DF366353BF17CC00499AE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0xB5E7A39DC8C2F7FC2D72FB84996036DD
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x7213866B03F9CD859138B167036A45C3
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0xCA1A0089F535A6B4C05923566B1E0265

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x9332F2598FC314C1BADF1A857031DAA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0xA3D5530900132F7E00EE2F44FA9E556F
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0xA7CF3A12B3BEBB757AEFC564B003C2DB
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0x67026F90BDCF6F693523D3374A7C5EF5
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0x93FA85407F976ED553B58CBCA4299FFD
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x50CEEF8DC925211FCD4D30360D92126B
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x251953B93D37E3A8027B0290BA69CA8B
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x0E9524A2C33348F68D206BE41C877B4F
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0x0F8A608F60203BFC7A89652278CC56A1
expect nothing more."
0x99DC392703A0735476AF4C36512596AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x7E34A100BFFF177ACC756D6A4B17D185

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x847FA11DF9C7CECD32B7971F12252E0C
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0xDF681109B0E484C80174AF9DD94BF66E
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x4A93BFEE7DF6024A6C97448507AEF6DF
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0xA63BF1F42AD687E50ED4A36846D0FE0E
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0x5A0EC983FCBBAA748B60E146C3ECC5E5
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0xC1C07F07A868552C2D62506B19ED63EF
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x4AE741F1C574092A305B7EA4352F3A24
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x39F417006A84EFDF529C1A6D34AC69DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x55939A5E06356E3BC046CC9C2CEC7207
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0xB22C3A8BB4B264BBBAA63AFE84E49672
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x15874FD8B93369B4CB920EE6D8DC0B88
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0x8EE9846330FC1DFC2FC3D97D91671E3D
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x69203CF45C44F6FD2899AC445E7D8689

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x2EC17B770D090C844ED95A62727B045F
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0x4A81D0A1143F457AF12571DED29AB674
approached.
0x25836F9AC77556800778A82426060840

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0xA74079432B426A124858EC973474B4C4
nurse; who answered--
0x8DEB1F7D3E5E7D12DE29FF2CF8EE9BA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x9489CB20B7B9196A3E4C25550601D19E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xEC9D33AC361535328767CF35FE9E66A1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x758225BB339AD8FDC88825585AA21DA3
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0x537E6BDBBAEE5437BCC1D936E247F382
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x2881503717BAED73B6FE5B4A26F5D8C3
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0x1BBCF93CD95B08936A635CACDEE133AD
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0x929433525CCA8F7C7421F6561461274D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x3C20CEEB27D366D0147AB21F4AB2D26D
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x6343E37E410E00469286C60DCE4DE442
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0x3432C00FD80E089E0EF7CECB9B9FD7D8
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0xA8DD94678394F1C9F8EE57D035122E0D
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x9056123C41CC105F3B8D941B1F7F0F15
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x445CB90D894089260B104EAE0AB98722
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x2BFF59008F3416D48FCC54D4F58FAC5D
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x8DCA2C541C7EDD2327B8567C84F987FC
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x9BBCD687D21DF430F8BE6EFCF1781F7D
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x229DBB8316A07FAB2C53D117623BB4BD
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x8900C109E61EA1CF8AAF58FB42A0BD5A
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x8BEF28E38F25E77A618A882218812716

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x523268BC79B055DE64DA1108AD694A7D
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0x3760C02DC9BB84201B65AE724305C597
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0x8F6817F860364EF412FA19B3B9BD8AC3
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x0650AF195E252C7EC578EA2653E63B99
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0xD95C23AD8EC288865163BD7420897BCB
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0xD24E75036EDAEFAF4F443F7952AA51C3
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x678D6668D5605B76E76F9A09C53F3EC7
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x6652664E40E1BB0A3CCD60011E938544
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x4A43086885A926C24EB1700A7E7424E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0xED243F04BD0C732375BF05F382E1F78F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0xBA51F56629B12D6506C29F11224B57B7
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x82F6371A372AA5E5D2A6A4FD89172448
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xCA064FD412CE33DFAF59B8D872C19979
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0x0C72298A7CA97385BFC7E446A0499250
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0xAEE1B5B895D987F90DC91B3D4E1DCA34
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0xCAE5865EB6E4C7416469B08ACCA0FEBC
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0x341F86B66CB04B44FFF9E81F50A2FC7D
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0x6B40638EC62D83B573896D5443FCC76D
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x4E5D8DCB979AFB48109CA839E0C54393
fed with crumbs."
0x06CC43CBAF8386075810E6197CCE0B6C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0xB9B5EA467A2C4AAEAEAC6C70B63CFC1A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x3BDEB34667D69DB9451E9EA4EF2A2BC6
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0xDCE5CE02FBC3DA359C6EC6EABAFD3FB5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0x7C1937377E4FAC3B675FEBFB774E9ABC
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x814011E57A9AF0AC9342982D7B8515FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0x3AC06ADB2ED7E9BC0EC8884FF5EF0419
clean town you spoke of?"
0x3BD9FFC865C7DCC722A9CF4F8FE21EA8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xFE39026F512FD0D4D6AC03DF2BCCE0CE
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0xA68DC1DAA607EF69C973B8E0B27A18DC
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x29C3600ADCA042E62BAC8D43AA89CBE3
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xB5BE0F4412E8896FBC2325D38610E33D
hear me sing now?"
0x21777132AD31728FD48B19C2AEFA78AE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0xE5AE359CE1C31E01CFBE239D83913A4C
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x141F85DBC7679001290D4AF275357DD7
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x2C3FE66477CF65120ADC866D76DC36AD
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x8A7C53C85D1E3B431F678DF1F12BB1EF
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0x6B338A94A6A23C3EE32D02820CA9E1D0
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0xE6A90FECF58A36B983054B213B4A8AD9
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0x81A723AED2E42A919798A0FFB612FAFE
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xC1C0E5E80BE178DCE482A2FD621696A5
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0xD45F7D9F097692F73D30251214282400
affected her.
0x2D1832D672CFFFD8E66396F97B852849

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0x724F158B5C2FB0DD1061CFAB5CA508E7
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x4F9C9C779CB266B5B610A569FA31D525
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x8B77EFF1BBEB044C8B47622C29472691
at least I thought so.
0x899FAFE4D2C26A72EEEDB41F6A1235C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x8EB1B690FBF8D3B8586A60BF7D30F1CA
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x257F0272D4FB9502BE33E31A9153D18A
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0xA8711BDA9742A2B89FE315497DF94E82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0x3E57A691191151E8B03D2C1D3369EBA6
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x822060944EDEC34E7D49ABD9F03A02A5
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0xCBF7C96537ED60D33155AFAA6DA21E58
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0x8F5D49E7DA4DC37A7681A899697E8AE3
carefully trained.
0x2BEBD44DF07946CDBF6D24575CB0B367

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x210662D2140F26541F776612C67B4C99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xDEE7777FABA34D606A89CB661458D31B
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0x04E599947F2B4069FE3BB586B82360E7
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0x2F51BFB4B6307BEF97E50B2775962126

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0x3787CADEFA47093EC3E3AD6AAB6B23D8
say, with whom did you live then?"
0x2BA0B3D7A8CE27189049CB42CC7FFCB8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xBC9EC0193466A9A29F2A7EA1BB69EEC5
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x13ADCB936BF2891572F0992A14D45CFB
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x64E44F9C733E715042E9C9CE7AEAFA48
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0x2180D6B03ED3F20984EFD2E60E27774B
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0x3CB9E24D326B546425DAE2148090ED52
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0x8053E985FEE69958062D7D6065094318
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0x2E31A3652BE81A820873674F5A7DD301
and I never see him."
0xB42FDC4C9552D7E63DA2C7B86DEA3C98

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0x1B6A3EC574E74D368BE70FC4B4E23121
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x0675AF86142CF6E364AD3F90A8F7207B
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x3D68C20835F2A52CA3C1C588DC9BFE9A
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x920718238E24267A8C91434D11B8F8C7
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xB028B3E72B0924709497BB7268455734
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0xC140FCCCD666DB096C9A5A9C5F24FC0B
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0xEE5A408262ED52FA7B42E2188F61816E
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x6D07DA34705EA3F9A9E8A23A25B333D4
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0xAF9BFA0F4F4C8BE28DD56950DF279597
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0xECCC8B7D55EDF18DAF7579B7D92DF457
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0x0CC2C2E00C06E215260E99464F0CEF98
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0x7215327CFD174BFD36D26F1522DA5BD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0x133449C88EB02CF9A65B660219410EC9
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0xA2B84845DFB2EF90C453BFEDCBEED62C
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0xE3FCFE8C8C5EF095865FE36AC5B4F849
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x7EFEEB9815D91B4F96137CC070C55079
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x008EBC28A3B28DFD17708C6AA6C2838D
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0xEBEB7A396BA51644C41120DBD7D3A7D7
use.
0x0197369801973698BD712E98F90B04DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0x626F4F779E71F9F78B21E7D2B6135C93
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xCC01F4C6A709010B693F4CE2F6D6B693
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0xDA64F841EB295F733AEB87113F89E4C9
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0x89D590D69522A914817F6BD12C81FCB6
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x715B47F3234AC26C4D56D8747BE75EF2
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0xC965D068BC46C5F6E16666B485197D6C
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0x6483DA784943CE16AE21FB87C6115E90
sideboard.
0xFDB2AA57B04D061962FAFF6A8B4F92C0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x3A6B3610A5AF1742522322F21AF90B11
before seen any half so imposing.
0x743A62F5656AB38E3081FF5879CDCF8B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0x6ADCBFE59AFC8DA578BB0AA8B2E74F50
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0xD1D698177E05A5E4D3DBBF556D293E38
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x30E9D309E5B9B565CE7B5D0367B655B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0xDA4D9B2C053D3ACD8B90279425B258B4
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x4884F2B59BE264071FAF9695B1F0CA52
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0x2B2BBBE8B3D095C119004BFCF6E725E0
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0xBD5A381BAE11DE974E5EA389799B4121
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0xE411B326213DAE921651342683413895
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0xF21ADB10E9252093CD84AE0B14F0F2F3
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0xCE76959886C8BCB95317264D151CE069
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0x03C7C4ED229AFBE91A7EF4FB777D7A82
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x121B308C3827F0B5EA3DE34DDA79B55D
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0x1986854B68431E468744BECF379E8FA9
general blending of snow and fire.
0x1E54C2E111AA015ED3A91BC4F597B988

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0xBBEF90089B877E256551A2C8F2957B38
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0x5FB74737C9124A2E65BEF707879E9489
were inhabited daily."
0xE52BC32C7014988EA9540CB883E0797D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x60BEBF7F8D280BF5A0ACC7C9A9CEDCC2
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x0E0CD443AB11E605666C072F0D4D22F6
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x882F84DFE89807D772F006BEDA682DBD
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0xE64FD0F22FDF2F15608745A2692EF9BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x7E0C27CB8BEE1EC304F7FBFC1F5FFF78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x3FC9AE2EDC6C2FDED4074D5ACDFDFC3A
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x314AFDAAF837198944AA0B9BCA69E0FB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0x2AD083B10CC37AA1E40C343E4E702CDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0x76F6C1E170B291845106A54C7990E1C5
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0x8D7A3AE1E2777C04B437ADD82AE0FAB8
Rochesters time out of mind."
0xA28A3602D2F2B8103370880AB1A07D43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0xD128CA7537FF1470EDE86525C24EA322
liked for himself?"
0xF290C5A0FEFC1D2EF41FD74B045CBACB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x2E3F9D25D563B2CA89366447A73F1865
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0x46DAD649AE484460B87BF2C1033A33B2
lived much amongst them."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0xF06282C9C24014FD62CFCB1D9CAE9CA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x6E7B378C8C87823D681274728A5F7403
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x6FA4A6E032A40D9F37DB30EF4D5FC683
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x332FED50B920BA0604F6EE284694135F
conversation with him."
0xCA729002D6F159DA77AC22AD92F6E6FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x6D78F874AC54FCB124837E2707EF2A24

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xB0BAA8B2563D210EA24672C8A3A74242
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0x2686E10972F4C55B51CCDC0D3AAB758B
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x96A3E576E10EB3BF3BBB059B33FE4656
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x0F0AF4035DAE9F2B7FFBE45151BF153F
he is a very good master."
0x67B9BDCF03409098AB0B7909C19D5862

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0xE38BA70D9760BDA8E9D905E61A1D6539
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x87A55AB6B616213EFABF3B61805D6C51
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0x0DD700E0174DFD6982CA05CD80B236CA
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0x3A84FD0666792FDFB0105FDD7088B5A0
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0xC8CABE76E69636EE0CE01C364E91B8E8
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0x78521DCAA8649585640023641E73B043
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x4CC98BA4CA89008F0D2A2F3654AA63F4
definite notion of his identity.
0xA0EE7198C2730D0389CAF8763F0674EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0x186BD50AD6C3654E130ED03631F26EFF
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x29DE1D0239222322F421B74F5A4764CA
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xEB6D9761DA160E8588769B288765204B
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0xFEE8B042966800382BEA1701A0C0FBD7
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0x6595DBF623295F68233B05F95F242780
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0x086B6C0BEB6C69D3AD29F03AFFC980EB
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x170839CB71DF165F84309D773B6F6871
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x231CBC921ECBD217E8114048CCF92131
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0xAF30E6F1AE56C395CF986A7657D601BE
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x0F3709FFD669E53FC8D5697A92F2729B
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0x5893FF9AF0969AA6F4A3E4044366FDF6
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x32E7259B27C496389E651A81D2F61724
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x2F0F541B1AF3CF8882BF2CDD24FD1204
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xF21F2EA56288B8B35BBBE3A65BFD4F96
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xD6B5002EF5560975FD623819D3D69D74
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x1B08F486BB497402387237B3D882737C
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0xB8EE863E512A16E4223F344066611707
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0xFDB63FCADA36918860420D534857F55F
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x8837B038145778FC6B0C90AD363B2947
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0xCA41235700F9E18C7F75ACC0A722773F
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x1626F7D1D1BC532725CDDC7853A6C965

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0xF235F24F97566AFE49B2F5069131E8F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0xACA23E80E704E6E56F90F5E5C878290F
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0xCC510140F320344D966F3B5C51E72FCD
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x1DCF98127F47642C64886D5FD18EE34F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0xCB188C5F8213E9B323C402E3D2D365FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x94AD5BB460600F4D25A14EE256C05DE9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0xE0900AEF609E66671A2F900010F4C24A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0xF789CE2BF89BA065261DA01DE708DA9B
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0x6D7D61B4D60C279EDBDC36F48F068A1A
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0xD5F4F6AD65EB138AA6535138E52F864E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0x8B4DBA421A0F12F3104068F79BFFFCE8
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0x5B84994C496B9BF01A9B320DDE4A9048

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0xF3B0E3487CA95568561F7F0F070AE6BD
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0xEE25B0AAA84A6F29B498CA56D774E9FA
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0xF3493B91CFCF9E4702851081025443B5
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0xE724A2EAFE7667FE7F1EA8FF8DD83E16
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0xE959DF887806B76F215B554FABEB9D90
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0xFFB18EF61BEA8E235EBD863B9A87D798
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0x2DE63B07DB5925CF46D5C0BD0851D148
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0x07136DB47058E3E272400558CB94A3C9
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xA80A650E762EF8A586A38FFC8DC04D42
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x9CE6FCCD96673C5272DEBE611F75ADF7
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0xFE7E1796AD8E3EA965535AC77DE9AB87
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0x7774D312A0F96123DA58488CF6E13990
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x76198BC316494D4E99605C7E0EF703D8
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x400AE590BEB22D567607BE1C71A4AE14
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x8C0D9AA1140521AE979705369577D35B
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0x98D33B1C590103F7004F8213D953DABC
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0xFF5A165A9F140426D325E04355471811

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0xBD2D40D7668A16D555A53033ECC9B7C1
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x292CDB36C5DAA7FFADB6226D393EC94C
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0xFFE86446FD9B22EA50BC75AF3D241A70
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x526F5F399BE199731F80113A27FE4531
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0xFF341394972D288C57E47ECBA6024F2E
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x6EAD35E8186DCEA6C9E1550F9B35F15F
Bluebeard's castle.
0x7B4D979F8CDBF576D7EC425F3A9B5F0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x5634EA618FDD83E52391E3E5C63E81FF
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0x1FE6755943A6C3C908332BAE3E2B1D55
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0xDE5C4815C2721DB05B901C2A6E6468BC
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x7EE821A46FAD946A5C917BD8DEAF68DD
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x94664394A32757E19184A00F79D9BDC7
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x5BE8F57A74466EEAE7023DD609BA25AC
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x3E5EEA13A58E90A326EA9CCFBE1AA200

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x21951CB01EA9BCC45EFF0FD8E8FACB1F
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x86C072C321E9F019932174BFF749809B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0x24609DBF558F473AC772CC3A89553505

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0xC68D754C09B6A6700201571DA3B98B3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0xDC2FB96385239DC695727B973819E682
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x01B69A92A6B1E1A61C5529B2473E1489

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0xD3F7E2E5DEE898975FB81C89705A7E33
odd murmur.
0x251E5152C6ABAB4305B2FFE3AD54893E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0x500073A0DB2F34CCEFE80F64B25219AE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0x1B7D72BD2507871159929CEF4AA4843E
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0x9BB831A10E4A9D654D03DFD053F556B9
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0xCC7BEE7847BE556D194964EA03E00D4C
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xB1D61E24A3EB4380D6EBD62A850B1352
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xA28BEB3D744A6E78CF69FAAB21BA9AAC
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x8C8306230485B7D6F0A587E215174018

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x031AC20AC5AE4C700A86A9E63047F5BB
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0xE9D5680C4AD9674A0BD1509F695B003E
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0xCF94845D9FF0204CD0A65B6A6468BAB8
be conceived.
0xD4436BD67AAE6E1450BD2AE2CA2D15D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0x7CCC272FF3FB66E3B678EB9263ABBE90
curtseyed silently and went in.
0x686376C2ECCEB7AC202CBBE991189D37

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x569F9CA2C29FE6F6A2ABBB95CC6F9297
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0x21BB57D31ABE802831E08D20161105A5
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0x978639FA069B8B7F883DBABFF08801AE
pupil this morning?"
0x0012787550F3A7C442822B04FCE518AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0x078CF52AB8AEAC276E5B796D28A14A65
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0xC487762ED854BDF25B6D259F4D895A2D
hall, exclaiming--
0x423F3EF3702EA5C5C2D0A350C5CEF5B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0x5F3E5C6C62398016D3C380601A703A28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
0xD437702A7B2A0C1B0AE504D2C2AFAEC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x4BDBDE06FF4971E01397653F66729EA8
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x2C3CE7CAF1BB312C71EF10F54ED2AB9B
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x2DAD4EA1002A121ABAE2A54473F8C10F
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0xD424412A5C4DAB0D95527072102BB6A0
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0x5F2FC5E09B3149EF3C30DDE8EB2245A2
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x5005675153C5B50550C5BDA92E6EBE91
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0xC5F8827F583D525A52FFA7BC8CB03F68
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x4270EF22F8216C1A2D36437812F32A53
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x74BBCF1959B3AF1C500EFF83EB1C910C
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x045F5C7E7FBF96DE801601A391CCA1A8
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xCA4E33E126DCC2102FC0BCF5C96ACD51
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x5B7093C173EC9DC03134B8DBD5785C73
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x4A0D729AA1560D762EA9E147AB775EB3
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x1D4D33F2618BCA7B041DD2DC9B30B65C
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x28B415996570EB6D5164AE887AD80116
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x0D503D0347B61F6AF2DFCE8B1F7CF7AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x5E3356D68C75EB93F86F47999C8CABDC
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x6763431E4813FF4A0BD113115AF5C65C
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x7EEF741CE5F1B0CDC6FF4631A97AE81D
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x9E8E6D37C9ECEE9B57033D86B219D967
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0xB855A1A1B38BA441CB190E2C89B68C85
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xA2BB232B26DAE9DF2C953C1E570E682A
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0x4E00D62FB6F454ABE2A5FA16DF8C13C4
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0xE492F807FA5501E94DEFA46A46AB1639
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x9DF076942B9D2A5C0EF141E5143EF048
of her mind and character.
0x8DE3426A19AE248560335F4ABE05EB1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0x019C9A43CD600F7B1B16E7E18016CED6
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x28C02A49E1ADC5228057A795AB330E43
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x392DD73BC758EC35198DB6CCA8981BCD
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0x9222CCD982D241D461564488E5BA5FBC
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0x8C5A52454D4504AD63B56706FBE11B1D
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x17B02B19477D0D72206A1AB756501D7C
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0xED2BCFFC3E4074BBCD2C756FEFFA78A3
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0xFD63CBDAEA0F5537AE097A6E7A3E063A
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x3FF2688DF93B6F2DBA2B027A9104EAF3
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xA72950891CAB3E02FCF0CE62980F679D
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0xA4136890C228935F7B615FB3BFF4884A
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x418B446698041AC8F2450CD28E92B3EB
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0x87AA50344A510FF0841A7C7DD5230165
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0x6D2F2D696663AF448C4180001F3C3AC6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0xBE32DF3C676A35AA2B538ADDA337D77F
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0x1A510C6EEF8C8B34BB8711EC46D89DFB
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0x30EF9FF1A84E450BF9FC34197D7DE41C
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0xF270B8BB40041804A62D3D388EA29834
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x22D482DB260769F67CF8912A1188B879
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x927B7FC9F358293BF43BAD2265625377
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x09F53365346A2BD891E0587AF250393A
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0xD3658064DD5D046520E2B9705A09597F
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x88488508219A6E9CB6414C712C5CE088
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x9E0EB4E39C2070DB738C46096B33B860
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0xC935FF21EF8E43547ED38C785ADA050F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0xD3E152E490BD60384E9F4B30E5369BDF
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x4007AA688BBFDCED2614C0686D395CFC
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x72A7A5B032C2FD6BAB3C0ABDDB38D512
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0x4C94423DB32E0BAD6423159E292E811E
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0x1D5047372C60DA885941CEB8F7E33989
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x64F32A810D818F320A9BBF710B2F6B90
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x7B5FE4083406013E3D64C41504FDA7F1
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0xFCA5BAF61B676FE1C6B4504D6158071C
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0x8A028810DC8EDB76E3591762B91DBA04
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x91805ED48578A386A346D571BCB1232A
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x215E4480D980314A8DE5DE03FD040BE9
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0xD4F0437D53DCC1263D0F1FE9B56DFE2C
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x0A19AC68E99F8CAB99BF300835F3F157
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0x52E66615AE55DE22CFBD8CC519AF0F2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x01B2DAFF2F9976394D11D8700E65BDB4
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x1BE486E1F3E6354BBFBE18DE83A01E0B
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x67D3666DCD3838D9B4647A7070AF064D
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x48C6B9753780B479F0703859C4EA2609
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xF3E7782639A15E97E4AC9939552F9A36
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x5EA158D15566E86A72C6662DB8E4E435
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
0x8D52C2FB2DB4379E9C5E9577B7A707E0
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x7064A43FFA3F6D8552D4F9E4FEA72117
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0xA5358DA9AAE31E86359215EA9D65603B
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0xB708FF1478A5453ACBF8644D07A2C2D3
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0x0124E0750A91A192B05B7715F94ACE1C
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0x7D2AECF1978E4D6772CE5756F0AB6E7F
every effort of that sort.
0x5F33E27C3D3050B5049BE7ED7A9A9A2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x3ADC47DEC3A72DDCAA595DD869228425
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x22EEC1E6D8C35EBEB5927EBA3CB63BB4
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x2D981C2DB0D5A3E7A39BBC66AC07426C
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x6B269E67EFBBE63717A4471E6AC4DA8D
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xDEA93CF11244150D9523705CA3B31213
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
0x431ACFE8272E6BA71ACC46E5C50E2CD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x704DCEDCA75D01D3B1FF0FB4690DAEFE
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x298785F35D87401A20CB05505AE883AF
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0xEE66C5D4DCCA6AB07B73CE49BB75A665
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0x2940899BB77EDF100E6B3D2030A43892
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0x108A742B2D9B7267ADC21F0402B4DE9E
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0x11088A3ACCC9DB1660034F7B98072902
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0xEF3BEB60ACBD0EDF9D5BB61014A9FAAD
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x98B8DEF2CEE41985A0CB135896F06425
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x17A3AC4D6A1A8A3E588B97A24B8D3D01
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0xDD768012A4B24352F65FA0B93D9204B6
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xB7396CB1A40F3A94ED9AC1BAF8BC8BE5
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0x5D18526B7209BD1E89A38A1ADEE0D771
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xB202DAB1638F3F0F9AE0A24C335CBF72
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0x46FA284A52F49B3CA9DD3D687634573C
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x9D4434D2BAD19AD9CFD7BEF6ECD2DC3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x0ECB74BE16F70465BDE37CD4B7034122
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0x6050C9B00CEF4E8B83F6ED86891E0F4B
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0xDD8D62B8FD7E29E762B275A8EC0D6E26
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x3F41C3B808A5A8772A35409FE5A72AFB
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0xCAF83A189176C0DA4093516DD3A09D63
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0xF03249431B7E4EE6F05E78773E47427B
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0x4338BAFA063F8023EF4BFB1F6ECB6E54
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0xAD24BBF7116DEB2FAFC17F461AE4865C
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0xA7FE81ACE51E749FDEEBE13B48DB6854
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0xDF03E833D53EF13F1DAE7D6362B138FC
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0x83EC350D3B7C6D86E33988F51872ED60
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0xB0B3F3A3ADE7162B2613ED1942AD9AF1
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x74F663EDFD02B4145D4226236DEADD23
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x7ECA41F22795791CCA3853809A27A4E4
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x1AAB09A3D4844511A62CB30DA4484233

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0xD05CD4A2D4C8EB89ED3FC0FAA1393068
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0x8DB5B070A78EE8AA6153409B5CEF4B34
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0x4141FC1D3DF8473F7C55A61E02FFFCD5
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x85AFA94F9E3F333B80F557C39E5421F5
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0xD72DF8784200629113F119538B04B6CD
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0xBE2E1427F6A1FB06EE822C8D3DA3442B
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0x540972C717C54C511A0846539FADD6BB
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x0DD80021834FF0703BE4005E6290773A
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0x1684E92E531F2BAD07E504B671270271
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x15DDDCB9EFA34DE47B04B471BA9AB933

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xCCB7FEBA94528AA9B636DB416A93C069
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0xC9F11406D84D8322296B85F9EEC1232A
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x87CD4E0E838DA5AB7729068D9F9C916B
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0x9BBA6EC3E5BD45F877116B32496FC3B8
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0xE974007D256841B0801BBB29C286ABD9
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0xDE2E5FD6F8E513E11D658026446EA8FE
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0x7F3106E2D336E61A0384917ED5051891
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xB06C6FC738263C3D0F323FD2DCA6F5F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0x9CBEE8859A5A462D82D64334A64A7358
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x23BBD8D2D2720A4721FA893C2B9477E7
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x643531DAC0EF3FFC8C7B699D40A03D2D
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x76BF95A5D2BE192E6E8F3FCBA5D57F16
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xEF1BFC0A75D65280B4566FE71AA08129
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0xA1CDF1B82B101C6590D6A08E0A92ECCA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0xDD2865B9CC7583DE2C420DC04E9CEB5C
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0xD30A66AD1C68B80FAF7CD4D2679B0593
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0x2A324784218DEB055628EE80C6271C3B
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x483E6001E3A596DCBA5C9D481B330B5E
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0xC3E2E08A1C1A193A3530346C37BC7F6B
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0x36CED99D7EE304865A73FD1E8309EDCD
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xF7D1F6B0EA26C8D2EF2CA4D6D298194D
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x2CC3EA345B019BB4E54973470263E073
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0xE77365F24CF0E60FE7CCF956565BA314
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0x20EA81BC841F3D41D60D91EA4692EB7D
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0xAE8FB36670268B5EAC6E3FE37418B5D7
me.
0xD786AAADD786AAADD786AAADFB021C99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0xC69170381D0DB1DBB99C75A8EB95B7D0
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x1D29C8FCB3D8D01F0D25446771102BC0
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0xD76AF2F675CC699A66AD9DC3DC68705B
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0xFE760D2CC2CDC20976C9905F6ACC2B53
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0x32E99B713418431B979AA0E3C98954E3
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x39DE12D3150ECA2BD09B3E8E1DE1C424
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0x95679E10A316D970DCE643C5376E5CA4
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0xEBA1FF0D930FE20470D7C7270FD06293
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0xBBADF87314D5A219C26BAB707A2642E9
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x5150E399B0C91B057897606CDD69CF38
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0xEDDB2F1CC0FF2B7289345D13A879CCE4
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x486CDAAA07A6EEEC9B2D7D65E818DBBF
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x4DD1D7FCF882700FFB930244EF712033
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0xE6448EE52E8C4E643984CEA1265AD4D9
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0xAE330AA5CE72AB78477D1DEAD678E2E8
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0x2079100A2C2D6F024DA53D504293D743
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0x16421978F745E7D3BEC062A82D00648A
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0xA61F37752D478897BF0C8AE8CC82AC10
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0x6FDCFC202EEEB24C9BD0ECEAF49239B8
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0xD0645870797B5B37CF61F432B4417F3E
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x0B45EEBDD0D2E2D6C4A1D95A0B4933F9
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x92750706AEB3850F7806D6E2E4F4E191
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x7CE73E7F8987FD05F34456F742AAE67C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you injured, sir?"
0x2F01196A87518051D3477A7419817C5A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x9436C5B26784AAC63C86783941142535
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0xE953BA3BFB78980F439D1CE24C522C8B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0xAA6D49ECE671DEE191A6574019F1D5EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x3B5AD290DB910E298CB8B65C92C13540
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xE52208F6AC511C3CCA816A96EAAFACB7
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0xE7C1FB738F4A589F3E0FA254DDAB8D42
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x3DDB126F8BF6E916AF2B7D2DDF85525A
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0xA3B668DA99F9932C7BD95D83DA934412
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x0CF6C3078E54417833470C5A4B0E67ED
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x53142AC059320A59E4AA80493A964487
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0x73C6DD3ACB6D33F061A6EE599E1C954E
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0x6C303B97D76E37BD5BAE6574E9A2BACC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x908120BD355ACB0638D24A1E55D63FC9
now drew near him again.
0xA0CE813CD3D4FECB0CCAB277F97099B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0x06903DA2585506015BD1D2B319E8D843
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0xB2A6ACA4EAFA04C410A7861DD4E9D8C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xEAFE60F35AE6CC09CDDACD8C6A7B25E1
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0xA06FEF043D98C153125D08A961BABC3F
involuntary "Ugh!"
0x3688ABA31FE5EA077373072A4B371189

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x8E5A6181250EBB22E1F170683ED3E7BE
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xB1C76E61898A8DD03554FA00C3E46954
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0x870FA53DE084BB90C2EE02D693EA3921
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x1D9115E5FDB17B4447729F43DF6E8A00
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x750D89E1C772A06F9D8672A7C67A6355
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0xBA2E79D01C10E416B931C4DAF5741AE0
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x5418EC2C5F5227510119A2CC83E56A29
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0xC6F7B4B0F30D03399870172B526FA103
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xC13620CBA7F07962E7025424C2EC78EC
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x88057E26ABB6FD9A0A3CF9BB839D96FD
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0x5420C4685743F3E12FAB2F455912A65A
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x4241FCAF804345099A9DDEF508E5630E
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x0E603D20E1E64F53FD7D64D8EF886ED6
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x125FD9F6DB5B7354877625B8821CAB2B
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x3F9D06E79376EAC52CEBE56FA194DB16
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0xC0F10C39F413959A279D9408E711878E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x7E85970B01EDDF4F70E84AF4B65F02AE
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0x68EB3BA7AB3044E6D03E837E81B21F04
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0xDA25953EDC3ADCFF517B0878ADEC0A89
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x00B6170E68FA2198C27E27B360DFBA96
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x976929B1E752991DCB8BEA53E7C27A47

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xC596A62F537C2C1D2F3BAFCC7ED6AB76
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xCCBF97869B9484926A4523BE725D17A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x744B764303DA32A6D5045AE6DBFF1E8A
direction before.
0x8A42D069D44DCB7E229B68CF9813720F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
0x14BB350161E47FA58ACB58BB983069B8
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
0x1D8385C176FE62190C6D1F0E8D9ACF0B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
0x2590DCBF00CE13B5D8C34C1990BF4170
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
0x752608BCDFDEDDBCC58DD35271618CBF
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
0x6ED0AF18899DFF38566A76644F4D473F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
0x5F1E2BB6DBA0D245455CBE7BEA7F9EAC
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x8DE54EC878964F88A510C36326ED2B10
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x16C7626314D14FBD55AB0ED11595A949
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
0xF9E2E4BDF2C5093D0FC99B63F8902D76

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whose house is it?"
0xD535A688B27A5558A18CBB13086EF8CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester's."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
0x8947D6D307328D3A87E6312B53E3FEC9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, I have never seen him."
0xC4C7662B70CB724982A903B079811E19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is not resident, then?"
0x9AEEB5F51E09962B214C9A2F7AA720D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can you tell me where he is?"
0xD5B3D2B7EC93134738DCD063AE60DAAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot."
0xDED6F2CDC6236AF2D08CB192728FF32E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0xF6D4F2F7A54EDACAF943C0F42C46FE89
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x8504C503D22BC8FB15F8E19C0919BF34
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x6C9FEDF1A676C9373854853F2F4FD316
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
0x8A8A7F69A9DC2E5D84A59BA4452152BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am the governess."
0xE151D4F3E0BABF5F18EB6FE4438AEFBF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0xD090508E7AED7EB35E3EC624481317D6
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0xA3CD57199BC26EDC9AD3F30DC05216A3
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
0x5F7570ECB4766935F2834B306FED8C18

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
0x199A4F711F88A4604EA06E9C79C4035E
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
0x46E41166107832D53A85661F33025B4F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
0x87BE3C3E681D3C7A4420EAA5BA316FBC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
0xE412CD047D0659464D6B5FB8A8C7088D
afraid?"
0xAA856135216AEE0B3ECEB0689D93189B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0xE5CC1001BE164657D95F9B68B693AFC2
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0xB7AA3FA5F6DE85FF867FC069CEB8D73F
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xD220AB49B5498A7EE51143117DB7ECAD
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x5EC82548BF94542A76C981E059C803C9
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x1FD7CD0CB5A8D69E907EABA25E9D0CEA
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xD66BB1EB0B42566978FB0780778AD534
he laughed.
0x9760B6F309D5C3A3420AEDAFC35692BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0x549BAF78BE4F3B0B38BC28089EE6A6E6
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0xE8DED1AB12C68A27D7E2EA7052A98033
come here."
0xF7F9D06718F82E7A564AACDA10A90A89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0x6AAADA3AD3698DC88B4680E059B23D11
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0x8551A1A03EAD7F48B6FF51F4950D0F57
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0x52393DF93ADB477D1FFCF94B3062B6F1
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xFC650DAC7342C56A0EEDA764277364AF
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x772DC2C78275CE5C7A0F21365341A3D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x0D4F075077DD9A110341F0AA0614B62D
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x73C6A6B10D499164B040C41F1307596E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I sought it and found it.
0xEAC66EA613D45683A646E0083B514DEA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xF62C1CE2FE2C49BD453E5E4AA39CCC07
you can."
0x43D2752F8F4D2D0F4786499D357C3E8B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0xD0454992ABF7E601C41A0742D329161C
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xFAD8B5588621852735146468622845B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0x4194E68A12A1A4E12D051FDF544CD3A1
   The wild wind whirls away."
0x6CF30CD774B033FE002A1994D20BA648

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0xBFB807D8D30A17DD926583497C684595
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0xDA93AE1EAD41BB6CC96585BE8A796EAC
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x5394BFB5B40D4187CB2311C83DF1362F
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0x24496F784524E51E10DBE6736D359238
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0x65D11C1CEDD4897A54151B1A96B3EF2C
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0xB7A10BB554CE457185BF1D154370B129
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0x6A2AAC4FFE141A458E7F12924EC199AD
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x3B08692F3EE65EAE3DC10D24BD4121DC
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x7689793B72169C1DE060DAB181717BDC
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x7041E49759FB0CE0056987D585C18F09
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0x58A204BC807552846DC7158668B68A75
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0x1614772A6D4E8D342784CBD1D1CB50EC
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x6FDA1EED3E37F1C8BADB9A866AAB00A6
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x9FC36A9C3A16C89B3D3C040633573273
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0x4B1BB3AF90FF1E35CF43527226C9B6E4
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x15B656086C5AFFE40322C004386D8EDC
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0xEE8952F15BC89B6A070E22157D922BDB
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0x391D5F8A29A484631C9609EC389A01CF
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0xF4B459E6B86B208A624A615E753CD670
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0xE0A1D9997A36ABC08B7DB5E723B10986

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0xACD7ED4C94518F644FF74BB0BEB3705D
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0xE1608C73D46D2C6EC72A558024CD6142
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xF64632161EDCCDB0F7CDC8E6604CA2C3
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0xF351FB2305D241D65D234D51C491A84E
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x2E5E9C7D6B2A57348F80B1675ACF95BE
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0xC11B38E567F4B8B2187DEDB1EEE3B52F
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0xB8B077CABF40FF0F69277F5683D9798C
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0x1C490E1628A9B945EDDE0C7B65E83BFA
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0xD37A06A7B79A8BEB7D9BBC952978FA1B
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x99D106DD96569903D85B860D646A48D8
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x71143FE230F6E6D6CB2F7D57B6E1A3BA
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x4B3FECDB84CE0F6D675A416DFF930BF5
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x8045596B6115921375BB9706615379CD
as it would be under his.
0x27421B9C649A017986A445C328329E7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xC6BC701636A9402E0D02FAF7F96412A8
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x22089E1CD4581B4178C1D3F948050E6C
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x33D84EC8A3ACC22CC80D27445476BBFB
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0xC652A9DA89B311F0D35C6C3A6B5DA19B
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x76CC3CCBD041F515AD8F821D23EF227D
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x66C775BAC948CEDB21A889A21B914331
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x3C2C15E20C4350A4410E6BA72C640847
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0x18AEFFEEA120E7454A75ED99E37B8F6C
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0x09C9BD8F162873EC87E21EC061C87C3F
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0x8A58AAF0205195F4CFCF96896B82D9F3
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0xAA19399A04F0E6A97B3F9065FF0A3C3E
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0x8AE7BDC0C61419C51498851CDF3D4321
door, and went in.
0xCAFB4AD82A5F436EC86B2DA8062FBDE5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0xF521861EBC5672792DDE484C46FCFE4D
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x2D9F666A563F72AA174654245E4C10DE
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x746177B181F005B85A8DA9E7F6B4CF71
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0x459927FEB072DCA0036C317D95AA70D8
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0x7EE9A012FE47BDFA13CD79FD66FE183B
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0xB23FE6EE41805E3BDB974B273479F81F
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x3D85CFE76130B9BA9D7F685E28F7D57D
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x171F8BE35E654929380EBD147B611531
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x13ED600476FC371F0C8532D64B093D15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x44F478E60E48728541B6F55DE7AE2B28
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x7AE07765EE3DA8716D89CD54612146A2
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0x79642E7AE14304F9991F4890B2F53E20
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x76662CAF50331F5D30A2678201D617EA
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0xD95CB3A69C671BE58F9EA6664DA745BC
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x74B39300F0B16B9397090A4505D4713B
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0xDB7679978FAE0F9470870A052FD28EB8
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0xC7E9665B119EC17B4EFC11290214C78E
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x882E6425D9F3C51B6AFCB0FB5AC53F0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What dog is this?"
0x2E8AEC519726B1E25F96A18553EA6299

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He came with master."
0x47971EFECC2AE3B4FCF8FF938AA7EC82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With whom?"
0x651BD9C182A5ED15878F4979B5F03F54

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
0xE67AB169CF7049DEAF6F5C3E103F026F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0x5A5E132A7521B279C2A2B9E70BBB7F43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0x7575BD6C7FF89B8226D524EE6E9CF111
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0xC63F9DBEFF88EA8E201D632F896944BC
sprained."
0xB7B7C10CE520680AF5F50C685BC57F13

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
0x59292E9A72208F5EC518195FD03CB29F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
0x7423CAF60D6B766DBA8B056589D8A3EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
0x2626184A434BDBA23F2B866533461D62

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
0x1FFEDB04EB8CBB50A935CF3A93794E8D
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0xF8FE1616B2AF94480F3917032FB71B54
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x1CC0AF1CA8120CE26CE2E22637925CEA
upstairs to take off my things.

CHAPTER XIII
0xE2DB7A98A83C2500EB061686D7B94555

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0x5E7AD9C6E6A5FCBF9FE53635E47616AB
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0xBD903E88BEBFE15C9CADDED4F271EA2B
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0xBBC754775BF61957ECE95C936C0F2FEC
and waiting to speak with him.
0x657C9D1263E63B1D8D89EDF27471B2FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0xCBE84E23E0DF0CC504005F00CC947373
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0xE567C070D5B6963045C53EEE5312D5C0
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0x26F6BC161A348BA78EBEA49FCEC08612
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0xF9B1A3E253F38ECB9FC54F5500B61B3A
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0xA4014DEE2AB5CDE5BEBFFE2BC71164FA
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x7BD31D6A3EF0689DB4D933CAB5E4FAD1
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x79AB7DDC3A72D35052A1C9FAF7DBCE30
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x74F07AF3F2B30BC2AE6DF95DABCD6EA8
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0x35518A382B3ABF85E26AAA5C633C292B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0x69445378D90D35099FCFD9E69FF33788
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0x3269410F1753CC711982B8D975D4899D
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x14EF5C4040764F892956FD59F7726094
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x13A40612436564D6AB84731E0813B626
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0x312B6668CF39C6D422AD9C2C5A0809C3
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0xE8029E2C12B77F10B0D771005A94962F
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x9A59E0027DEF8C1CB885CE4E246F79C5
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x2A17857A961064E03EA99A1E7BACFD18
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0xADB54C2FE2E5C9A6EDF0909E9DC503DB
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0xE1203021D67635BD1E727F3C8916F434
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0xE7819EDAC1AD2716CF7E51B23464A26A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x46E92A422B7AA8D2AF3241C658E3D39A
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x9FB6A67C214DA61C2350C60904E363D5
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x8D00D28316F09BF4CE84B1A042B937B6
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0x5C32FB36F08DEDBAD59B84ABC7C625F2
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0xD9EF11AEDEA5431BF8EEF7CB8EB8948F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xE9434753A9E6784D8D87FC2F47CB8BAB
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0xA08849227AE2862C0383D28FDBAC67AF
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x84B4F8A39EF9B54AD79BD11A0A2F60F5
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x6040728D19441FD942FE18DF1F8B5CA8
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x12C86585D581716C45962A5B437B8CD6
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0xBB2F539B1AC086AA0AB16473698CD885
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0x4F60CA54BDD53018DD3990BFCE988FEA
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0x85AC9D5BFAAA1B8BBC31695E82ACF082
fireside.
0x37BCDCC22026F4D50277BFC5C64E87EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0x17813E49E45BD2193B422EE21C4C4FA1
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0xACC6FB1E62BD358A2B99CBD764621553
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x883FB53787423787D2C2ACF8D92DB086
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0xAF5106A0908C97B2108D874167DCE0C4
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x1F093E299674B6311F6F4C4F1000B801

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xD233D594B51324F90209026B7B3DE6E3
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x551F6689649CFEB63C0919CCE50B743A
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x7026443AB4FB7595DFD60BC343B4DCA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xCC7877CEEB569996FDAC344F1DA9A941

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0xB55CD3BA192806131DA2BFE59A624383
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x33491F9EBE9155D6B9DA46864C0E2A4D
candle."
0xD12E3097EF7A97AEFA5E4A593847247D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0x45AFAAF51B0DDE35ACBEB69EBFD0E43F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x4D0A7636B7D1EE34A317B19E8BC67FCD
is here."
0x64D27EF46F58DF5B80E2DF4A5A77EA21

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0x74FFC960F8B3E7ADAD73BE50FC2F3D7F
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0xA6514DC33CB383AF27F41B239E73EE95
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0x1FBC77D151EA4E96B9E96CDB2B573474
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0xC7596813E0A4DE3583A6CA72A3FDC1CE
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0xD087FF9DBBD30DBC8B6E83A49091D6E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x7A5CD7A6BE602AE718AEB3D92BB86135
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0x9730D18E0859BE8CF8E30797649D931E
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0xFB4CDF9517054A2639A5ACB6BBE7B4C1
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0x6A7FF355BE329A794C1EF6022CACBE93
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0xCA40A823A99BFA1DE655BC03F82351F5
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x0776E607261B47D92DB55D8D270CA633
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0x437D44D443DEACD0D618E562132B7E08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0xED932713E6A7D00B8B8062ACD0E5C02B
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x3E9D5162996DFE5D31C1A34B7E623AEE
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x37019EE6EC94B0C4AE6031F1E4A2CD6E
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x4EE47768DE6ADB60332213ED464443E1
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x22697D57170AA7535D6AC042F53F3911
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0x334551F88F201F9692333A692A3A5B54
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x9E65222EEAB2A05A442B21F3848E13BB
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0x4E6DBA7396297921D5C37B7CE22EA2EE
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x1CC94D4490C326BEE99CBCC5BFDFC751
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0xEDE6F00C2FF88B02AF2699F5CB1FF91A
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x410051A58044DCF4909083567EA074FC
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0x71C409126F743494FC1F6DBF9E5728CC
neither tall nor graceful.
0x59CE86EC974A6FCB85A9D13F4384025E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0xB0306C4AFA7566F5CBD7186AD3EF911F
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0x66023C46A86AE9B8EA9F7B4FFFAE53EC
lifted his head as we approached.
0xB73B75F4055B8EE6C324559C78450D2C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0xCB456FDA90DE53B8DE90F694423C38C2
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x242923F4D7E744EB0040B7DA5815F897

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x7B440274B01387C5AAC321A38ABE17DD
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0xCC27382219DC80F659C1A5C64C67A75F
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0x26475FD9B2FF7268529304C6B15385E1
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x937EF066E25D70DF6FA1267EDEBB3982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0xD399A32E5B57E3AE89A6B0558532AD31
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x63A8096F9A07F4B58B2E7ADF29F4BF7A
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0xCA7CF95B87BF32FC9CDD3BEE9B10711E
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x3C987A423379EBE7E7A1A0D13FE66F2C
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0x1E210039FE64BA0014CE19FAB27C0E26
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0xD54DCDEB3BA4FE5452F8DED65848BD2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0xF4BCC4A5C7DF731D69FA469EBF21A096
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x4D273B19A1F3D73406363FF5C210A2D3
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0x6DA9B89E6541D08259F7BD325D7A687A
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x0FD50F9B9197817E91E6038BDF6CA226
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x7B9D58CBF05AB430B7BC857CA54C4CCE
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0xB4E44DEFC42B78A2AC2E29001EBF275C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0x8F34EEF4C3653791B98E4E115FB0EB4E
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0xA9CADFC3E62BD2441C87436F7A65EB14
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0xA85B25D524EA9653A232302CAA84BBFB
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0x2CD4B11AC3BD27CA09313C63A9809960

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0x28D61F6A4D5E66AB677380D284791B3D

0x294C6734F1E9FC52035FBFB1F1543A0A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0xA42982C3D45B7F93C413932C714353B1
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0xF0EA02805DBFEAF06EB198746C73E48F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0x6676557CBD7C9E4A454138958E8F972F
votre petit coffre?"
0x6ED342A77823CC239513E4514049CD20

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0x07DBB19CB984170C1D6D1E4C0A0C83F3
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0xD4C3463BB83B3406342D70BA7A67D731
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0xD375D8071D051A6DAB8BEAC8903EDEEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x8472B70DB2E814FBF0CDE53FB7F9571B
thought pleasant things."
0x5BA7538CAAC9E5D6DBBDD224BE737EAC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x76FDDBD12E5493E0E9BC53622D46F44A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0x11C145A656D03D1E69A087E8DC4AF39A
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0x1B11AEAACD1B1D861F398FEA5DFFFA63
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0xE1A5C544D9891BB290E6C2C423C40CEE
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x39D3069392468CB172C6B6178BB2AB60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0x103D9D06E8CD42B9C21971BCBCE99030
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x7A6BCB965D3A98A137A49D5360399D26
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0x94DB027A4B17F16052B0B7FEF99B8C9F
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0xC25F7D594EAF8C6303E9DC95EDF9022E
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0x9D96A7C4A93075FA1D1A20DF33FA7EBB
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xA3877E37B843A5D97E5704BD29EB5C43

0x41B6E69758C2546269663FE3FD255FED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the

meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x8879A48ABD7D21D4C82D3E2B31AA54BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x7225073075F5ABC7CF8F1E490DD05C27
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x37344470EB62235CA47FE4569B1A0D8D
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0xED0665B51D05B75CC53522184DE17621
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0x84DCB2FD41A6F69E76D4183FD766DE8E
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0x7E0E12FC5284CDFDC9FCBEAB5397A3B9
amuse herself with Pilot.
0x4BBF8A1DB97CC97CA9EE7837BDC5B32C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
0x21628FE5168612439BCB1FD83E791AA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Eight years."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x341FACA7DE76821C2F9608C6E3DBA7C5
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x2045BB1D3901A26EC8394481E343FD74
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0x6A00886FFF83394C06EBA33AC38E3C10
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x334B695A0F755229B1E4910574CBCA7E
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x9ED0F4D447ED0C98FB44156672C26045
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
0x0E1AF4932E381A4A7C4468A3735C30C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
0x5EB36EDB01BE76534D74433AB673B7AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
0xBE572329B0FA25E20FE6D67EA787706D
that stile?"
0x6977EDB22AFB31ADA80B084DC5DDA3D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For whom, sir?"
0x7D2085048328792DFE299223FA755137

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
0x1A174DA56775AD128C32D1775D3EC7EC
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
0x4EDAB5E26834C05247A15E6EC98DB165

0x99728E2EB284217710ACFC361D05DF57

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
0x6F3753DA7EFF5CAD07CD681F02ABBBA6
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
0x818748718D5329C7316439C8F3C1E414
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
0x34AAEC07D0CB198BE1A8EDB7BA34D3B0
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their

revels more."
0x05E2EF12754D7ED65ED01AFF1FF06CDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0x821D8791C7271275045E24E7DAC834BC
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x47C4DBB854BD4791CC6435A3330ABBEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
0x82D09AED711AD605DE5B69621CECC09B
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
0xD84C4D6F214D4C8F6861F2ED97D68632

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; none that I ever saw."
0xABF6A4740E25FE959AA94D7279FF36ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have no brothers or sisters."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
0x689B7CF2739101AF33E93C6809CF2A47

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x94C4D170D007AA58B00D3168A6D7319D
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0xC385EE3CE5442A8E17D2FE3A4BC0BC08
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to

Adele."
0x5D338E855D338E857A52985D68B53FA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0xE4C930456B17331C93D9249D60B4F857
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
0x5BE9115FDE8AB05C520CAA2E6A060826
felling my horse."
0xDCFB9254017A9063EF25534921990476

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
0x856FEB7E337AA025259601D9B332183F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
0xAA4F957527AC88FC67DA9D1A53029A85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir."
0x3B2A0BFA2C5D852D1ABCBDFEB5230EFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you seen much society?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
0xD87DC0CE479FF477014993FF83932029
Thornfield."
0x30E73D304D4C3015703BD6745BB38C3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you read much?"
0x2EA0CEE125AB0DDA8D22777D551AF4D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
0x662459C3900BE2002361A76137C4D255
very learned."
0xA8A516DC20D8C5C1C080092DC3EB4021

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
0x74AB5D0BCAE5245D1902844B46C15118
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
0xD57E64546232B4E3B95CAC8A0870622A

0xEA9ED42D20FD4C8E8E86D1FCE4AC1577

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
0xFBC5AD54B24765FCF2823C718EC3C619
would worship their director."
0xA5BF8AFC15B9777F11B8F141AE39697D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0x647B75C65BF13481EF1FC54475160055
sounds blasphemous."
0xE4D421DD079AA5AFC9E25BE6B4AAE081

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x908B845F088C4ED8A5DAF75CDCA0D8AB
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x0801D021EE6B2FAC9CECDBED8C11CEEF
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
0xA179C1F6B1E24933D1DEE4823D5C1423
hardly sew."
0x1F060D20E4AB26BB1E30C4C8CC4D5728

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0xE67BC73102F6ECC65EA33B0F9BF9A5AC
caught the drift of the dialogue.
0xBDD0FA4D55590B0F68D013E82684D0EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.

Rochester.
0x47204E6F677E3378EB49B1F26915033F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision

department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x93FF31B15F7B46CC6051384500424046
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0xB218D783C5B8FD6CC833D04913D0EF52
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go

to bed."
0xD1526E5C730B0A5E48062FCDC85BA527

"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0x902B2E1F9826F3AAC99B7EEE4E48FE0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"About ten."
0x5B83EA41BAA5013E828BF42F33CC8544

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
0x12AADBB01905159E6C3A59926C5A0228

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I assented.
0x2C358209C226C9A43F9C243135C57685

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x78C2FE82325599EA3E4D86CF283197B4
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0x93B56FCBAA2F35CE66E2EC9BC2DF1A42
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xD2A291CCB3F8F3322DA2397E731E69B0
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x57A06F84A997C956AB00D641ABACC8A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A little."
0x4119887E46290CF1617DDDBF1B920197

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
0x69809B71F8F48C1C3EF7638679595ADD
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'

and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new

inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
0x8ED9C12F8C9752490ADF4800BDAB4F54

0x4E7BA0FE720A231183642F6AE334B5D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I departed, obeying his directions.
0xE20D6208DD591750CB3154727EBDC557

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x0837B078C7100B97ABC973D6A508EB3B
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0x00DD09CBA20E14032A662B0EE51AF11B
not well."
0xC31B28DE95739EA610F9671BEFB47CC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed

me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know

He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid

them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my

some thought."

While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0x90FA4B9ACCB25D689506F80A6E6C9BD3
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0xA116E32B8CAE022528EAA2A62AA3C0E8
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0x8843BAED6BE11A1FD2019A58C351B570
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0x92C776077B956F241620575BFA7F9D08
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0xDB8CF06309471558D3E0DD4B2F81958A
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0xA25059E421CE1BF371FFFC5C24D83FE3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0x0EE41FCD6FB400E368974F68C15B4DB2
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0xF5756833F9B5143FDEB4D028EA83F3E0
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0xF01368F236902AA4E66CEB54ECEF1E30
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x78999B77612E964ABC42478B1FC7DADD
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0xE6AE4B90F5DF4BF8A084CCBCB43D1E2B
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0xF6591E1DDF175F32CB965C4EAB04EB19
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0xA34C80C3727B69E313B416BB4346D298
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xDFBC3C49350D7A3164D28817C2165DE1
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0xE6316B74426C7FE94E24ACC54686A5A4
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x926BB2BDC77D6726747986B9B782AAD6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0xF3F3C5686990F9D98E2FFF2EE8FB4D8B
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0xC8F7AAE7062067D559007BB3C081EFCF
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0x512915580C3808DC1C1786E6D75536CF
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x71CFE9DA6B12D1FA0B87D2C420457887
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x38EB852053FFE5BB4AEA6303AE29DD84
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x3B5C7E99A78F1B32CFE6DFEECFAE05FF
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0x7B5594A6D1CCEB18CF3BEFC6123BA9DB
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x40BD489BBEC181A232E2F9439ACA1421
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0x3F68B1A07AB5137F02DA21E5BC1E8C02
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0xF0541B8BF1E39D71C64B6DB23C835A2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0x4CE6056AFD96FD19B675B0953A073C28
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x09CE26091F381B447082B8B8F5A571EC
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0xA36FF9CA1281B6B6799518E0F2F30714
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xB156C967EA55D07CA9F39CB46931B7A1
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0x6D013AB0E39CFC77D90D06C137DED14F
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x573363C8F7C6955ECCB0A426E6350542
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0xF1EAFC9A565EAF9C7C7AA15BBF9DDC0B
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0x9A2729122D12F4BB4D81E92CDB39AC8B
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0xFAA6E8D5087ED75EB5CFCE25A2DB9E34
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x9D80ABCB905F8E9D10B77D792910A09A
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0xFAA143287DED4B30701424079E237594
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xBB2F19AE3943F2AF0439386D138A1827

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x7651967AA559FDD25A6614CFF8E54D71
presently.
0xBDD85E1F65809E94C8D7AECB3229231D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0xFEF07FD4A8534311E3098DF31F21CC8A
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x95CF4F1D1EC8ABB5B2000F24C0C3DCD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x706FF9AC2D6F24A6D8DEFCB466C855A8
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0xDF293889D7AFE0186ABBEBB137C3073D
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0xA0F37DF55A7D45AB85C34850AF6FCE5A
each day?"
0x709DF87C4AE267B426158D026E02DF23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0xD4D6AA8790367EC22347410C6B443302
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0xC8A9DF98729AFD1377806AFC6836D6B6
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xCB370E0197CE2ABBDD4E1C76385C22CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x0FAB79E49EA98F1DA5FFF89A322F0477

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0xB14F05BE2A2FA7D7A9E8FE12E2CE83BC
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0xD9F6FAB04A327A54BBFF09538BD9D246
powerless to realise."
0xB2F8FE1122C02C1CE311A78365AA89D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x9417E6CB357B541655F6B59EF92DB3DF
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xA661C040DEFA85F9B793B2B536831D53
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0x3B6CFFBB2511A793734A6D5975CF326B
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0xE509272C02BC976E423C5797759CAD16
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0x40A6470B3345C3769E1A563D9240A792
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0x7931E6D2665C40BD77748F4D472EC3FA
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x491F8FE2682A07FE05F6B27B99AA2A5A
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x183D44B02896EADA4C6FB672ADA83818
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x07F7A91E260E8A4DF471471ABFC43B46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x0F82B756CD5079BB13C431E9201627B5
watch, he said abruptly--
0x4FF8307A7E33AF1EA8AF459452CDBED2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0x9BBB628226115228251BDFA76CBA9445
so long?  Take her to bed."
0xE57191506C76663D2DD08CD09259FD44

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x9B6A5E45ECECED3C1924A40C594A4562
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0xB3E7918AC28D0D881D39EF09B8B3D249
much.
0x6468DCB16468DCB1654A5E5E7C2F1F84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0xE8A14F95918E3221D5072358738BF880
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x9099D73E1B3A5A4DE7C6FC09D79080EC
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x8D50C437B8DCC1FF172E6A0B615AC2F8
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0xA32AA1BE70018032AF7E5F946F847B93

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0x733DAE385EEE39CC2B251990CAC66303
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x89DAAA0DEED65E282822E5D8859B0123

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0x8097ACC1E9BB7CD134A6F6841A60E767

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0x0A8145363B6A9628CE02AB39DAC43BD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0x5C683BD4F94CF58E21E2DA314F7F9EFD
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0x85BD1EDA2A70FBD82FD5DC44F3940B95
temper, allowance should be made."
0x2DEDF36E48EDCF0A0979B614C5DE4602

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?"
0xAA617C58AA617C585B4BC71B70A543D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0x165CA6BE2DC9C218BC70EC830980A1EF
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0x669D1CC2E26CAAD8CE994F1BF0601987
make his spirits unequal."
0x3229926FF5318040856E3C8DDC2D0987

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What about?"
0xFF2BAC86609F5BEF9C2DD745C4F01D6A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0x3E43B67391BCAB47AC9144BC30CC56DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But he has no family."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x49107C907D2755B0E9FC0BEA545C43C9
brother a few years since."
0x027B4FA8F94A00CCAEA8C105EDD7C78E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"His _elder_ brother?"
0x87E4690AD8B66395A07F42244B5A1352

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0x3961FA6F4BBB80BBA22DB10B27C3EE97
the property; only about nine years."
0x3DE7AC7059B3E286FB3D603C6FEE0042

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0x9D9441A9D6F617A0E98D02000C418027
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x841083DE65FBBC9654C36DFE7B63C3E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0xB9F6FF7C52BAE4E6CD6DDC4DDBE2E948
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0x5BEECBBE2EFF35865B65396E1B7FE053
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0xAF0273423A04FE4260E96E8683A19B1F
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x014C111482FA4BA9A823E93AADB768A8
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0x9AE31C5009F9B266F6EC0C5FC59116C3
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0x0B2F5C5D854E56D18D5E4940486EF96B
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0x6F675E9EC220A7C290A84F0B7BE1A1AF
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x21AD438F1CD5AC63DB8197A448F4D5C1
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xCF63519E0C348D85AE6045269104FF72
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0xFE462B214DEB362EAA455D9A439614A3
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x91D50BDD72DA5C9EDE24860F9A20C4B2
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0xAC2C99F5D36D7B66027A6A93DA20A0F1
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0x43116DBC74539C9BD923A52013ED7325
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x0B78C7D2613E05DCA3353F951C4812A3
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x1B8AFDC687C7AE0EAB541BBEACD6A384
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."

"Why should he shun it?"
0xEFE3C16EAD40C1BB035FE09BE3D9EDCD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0xF57D5EFA865C5800E458C94F3F38E8C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0xA9EA4AEA8D69CC410866D0DA78D4EBF5
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0x35B08822141437D8433BBB5BBF67870A
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0x1427D79F8CD01227A5627D5784FE46A0
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x6BD7C224162DFAE4E77E953A56CA06FC
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x87AF4209743E2514FF8575946972954E
subject, which I did accordingly.

CHAPTER XIV
0x4B751C37AA0AFE7BDB70D0AFFAEE6AC6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0xCF99417F67FB4FAAFF2A3C9E52C9021D
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x5947B11C5CD4ED59AACFEBF1BFAAF894
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0xEC9A2595B702A37DAF29BFCF7BEF25A8
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x7884E5BD0533CEA5195EAC0CE840E9A8
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x3B67F99C5C49FD41F14A8E89A25679B6
generally did not come back till late at night.
0xBDD9E525D9133E1DCAE0C21276804854

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0xBFD3C40EE3C923A976BA320B5AC9C624
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0x49DC17F6BE6A313180D8833BC993AB29
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0x83A5BDE2BFFC00A4E0476F80BBD6AAB0
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0xE7091D9E18326C8A6AFDC78A3C33C078
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0xD0AA1A8E54E971F5D0716EBB4EFBF15B
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xBB656EB60BCA254214A2CF158064D523
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0x5BFD1D3FFDDBA9A6B6707715C847D144
causes quite disconnected with me.
0x8409E494630F2D63140C3EC47B6D58D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0xEF66D7C6B2418FE21FB8EBB717C5E27A
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x3CF8592267C2B8825766092BA709B1B8
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0x65B6AD28C47D529D51E5DD2878E2A36B
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0xA88567BB60960F8C275575B42D21A6EB
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0x0D60333C80051F1B5ED9E3FB3923DFE2
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0x8765F61BC937FAD1A874154A2A0E576B
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0xB2043AAC4F3D8E7AF043A868D87E1F2A
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xFC6CCD600867444E7F89FF1DDDA9A3D1
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0xDFDDAD006538277139F6EAD7B74B0E83
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0xFE2785470FD1501C6DC0E9379188D2E6
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x7083A901BD09D09DE784F5459621F5D8
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0x59448FF9644E9BE777538464D0752F40
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0x3F10FD1D8C1D6FA5F66A506C439D8B0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0xA1108E4CA37BFDCD0D008420423D9C63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0x68DFDD139F2D2C7F23CA4C4524AD7A7B
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0x7D60767C6D16AEFD33C8A2FAF1E3E362
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0x2A50AFE83B2CFB9CE384ABB15A26CB78
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x519364193BDBA97FF3A223C7A16885DC
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0xFECF34DD705120C74ECE7D7ECF51184F
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x3E80CC020CCE605B39F7279F04BD2DD7
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0xDC32B16B99FFE718490C524C94B0AD92

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0xF0C4D79911797E296CB39A2344F1B22B
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0xD7453887BE040B7B96D87729EBAA58E8
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xAA6918DFB3B33A4D13F1A191A23F75EE
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0x67D511A42DAE8B156F993D40381DD6F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0xED967809534625D97ACC0A3FFD2DAD19
contemplation.
0x21CAE44AAAEF14859D6F6DFB9869A477

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x5C901923E76520AB30C86D0FC20DB9AA
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0xCE77AD0F63854FD3469DD1DDF5B6F5A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0xF0A9C4E9996E2968F97F46471E31706B
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0xDBF24827A0E5C79EB7E0EF008F6BF954
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0x493B06B1E5026BB75ED3ECF7526619A6
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x9072A4B98EC4178027DFACDC7365D1FC
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0xBE5E4E85E6BB3473FBCA8524C83D1405
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x93F0344BFE4CBE3738AF8EBE1346B6AA
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x542C5D4BFEE68BF95792FB5A0838B036
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0x48C13406A7AE0005529B7FA5AB7A8A55
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0xA0207DC63591ABC9D997174C3AC9A847
said to be thicker than water."
0xD5700D505ABEC6A97206EEAB1C8A1C44

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0xA7B71C933804D8529BD4DEA68D7D5F64
knitting-basket in hand.
0x437301EEC0FA190322E4F86203729FD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0x02EB3BC1E7EF3BD729920B9D7B933B6A
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0xB2386B92DE15D3250B9B18F2C075965C
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0x2943C0DCAC9DACA71EA27F9BDF5217E6
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xE831107FB1C376885F62C1EDAF55F263
performed."
0x330529617D6A749CC12A66C7DAA8964B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x065DEE0AB72C06A3CAE361F032BA4CAD
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x0798752D64B9E7E29075D53DC5B8B011
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x336514B5E8367ABC5BA7BF06609EA64B
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0xDF2744647BC2B903BA913DA66BAEEB50

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x657A863B5C7434F31A8EF2BA248E950B
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0xFCDCA82BEE187F86FB89F3FB6A25759F
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x73456ECE0B5ACC7FF4AC8AB725BB3B44
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0x25040360B9F95F6970124EB81D18BA76
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xF129981FAF7835B02A5C7FD53B7D6002
mind to do."
0xF1CB274B170C1CFC668FB2FCEB13899E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0x91B60CC5E89209A9A9CC17833D1AE3F3
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xE97F70C535D55E4C8F53ABAEF999C634
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x09004B9D0760D73032F4DC0DCEA889F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0x3138C6C33861E6AD0CFC508EABB93D52
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xE32974BB5A4A5BAB92A00A44CFCAD287
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0xDB9603636211DAF41FA82DC3DD33AC12
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0x7AFF86ABC51288A0679013CD1D259F2C
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0x561C2AAEA0ABE083ED2A5BFB9618FC24
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0xE4B72ACF46572E0EAFCE45A40EFD1464

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x2C495AB0BA3068B33E88202F7CB72AA3
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x92B3FC226B5AA4E3F39BD31CA792B25F
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x863EF54FD630815241A3FECCDDA8A261
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0xABFB9B4987368FF0F1A93A1682FC689A
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0xB69CF7F3F8C675E2CEBAD5961FF7CEA2
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0x76BD2D31671485A6FADA2A97F3C1C2F9
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0xDC6C5977299373A7B20F07AEC4AB632E
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0x1B7FD7ABC551991B4AD7E3E2A8169BDA
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x44F1409F1A2A8E9004D24F589F0E3AFE
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0x4DC91C00E8AD07B37B74DDA6DB1F969C
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0x7793273A9F29C6C84ABBD2B8177CE072
feeling.
0xE9933342FF79ADBAE0E6980F128CD345

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x76C2F3491982680A4B083519932BF820
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0xD68E732FC89D6A100315A478016524DF
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x5F605FA53C232AC57749DD45D0B1A67E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x9DB2DF7B111B4D0E3B69D4F9834DB358

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0xC198B7E5400B52E1A2F6C943CA42C254
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0xB9BEDD1456426F28639BBA2D79C76C86
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0xF053E1727373D459BEE161FF75CDE2EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0x74E6DE8C37450BA107DCF1DF747AF181
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0xB7F4D93B953143BF9FA86975BD5E0144
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0x418E16D9D13240DDF3BF8F0E0FB819F8
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x8C75A3B0C50D6969555667CA410FA964
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x30A6AA4D449ACAFC63F798F1365E9470
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0x155BF1B906C4318407043234895AB7CF
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xA0E8BFFFCA69F91889CD953E2F9C3AB2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0xD9E048124932E891355EE3514599D6B1
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x501604882C479BBD2A59465754EAD24F
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0x89ACBDB03DEE4C6ADAC46CE0D960EDCD
consequence, or something of that sort."
0x0089F1E77723A14854BFAD3C39229AEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0xE5BCFB307744EC147A672BC71346A636
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x0AB6FD707AC94FEEEF0AB61C4B573F78
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0xC0C5A6979C33456214BC10DEFFAF7F3A
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0x6A96611F77563BD712CF239090270851
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0x075F84BA7FE82E3F7EF408903D56B644

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0x3EE7CC49962DB8843847D7461228107A
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0xFEBAD942D0B889727919D582936516B4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x33A5E6A4211DB8A64D83C730601DDC81
does my forehead not please you?"
0x34A9A518BAD9815E05696776A9E61144

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0xC77A22604F170FBA05FFF03FC7CA1289
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0xDCF02D787A844524FF5CF4C61D9D746B
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x3883E4831C8352BA0A062B7BEC27F68F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0xFD79E244CC379FCD7F916CEE0FA1290E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x22F14C14ABA8ADF815D018AAD7F66935
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0xAE3395F697B50759D02A2049EB74D6B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0xC048C22608F9219B9D83169124E83EDA
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0xF7AAD3CB5BC0F4B867D8FEC327235F26
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0x3F2E8F772610AA53D1DEC8FFF3602B25
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0x07D5CF570ABEAE45452368A84E1AA246
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xF8ED27077ADF1FA5DF578B8BF3E70951
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0xB70081EA1F19849540DDDA6FA8986FE7
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xD91EA6106F0794D25D4CD72EB4147AE0
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x53E9A0B0B9A8C3E5DC44B114DCC52052
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0x5AF1DE8E260EC9953267B8DC5D1BBE16
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her

knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0xDA13CEDA19F6B403FBE4416A82D0FDB2
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x14DE979EDA32BF6E19E619666AE199FA
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0xA068D464B7360FBC02E030B2F34F0229
me?"
0xB93EFCD6B93EFCD64A090BD4F92BBF7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x4EF964F76F83C31FEE4E53D6D8441D87

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0xC3BB3AC858396CB015A4C7C065112938

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0xBB927834ACE9666384758CBFEC4CBD3E
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x8D7A5230F336F5053205C8482D254CE4
capable of being re-transformed?
0x4991121573A58CFEF60CFD0DE7E1C066

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0x00CE1E5620BA80FE0A9FB6680269357B
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0xFDA2336BBA332001B8FE13DD835F2324
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0x03BA1FC9C40E512A1D8E869B15A51199
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x0091B28EC4ED4E462EFD16699900DAB0
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x205AD456AEB9C40BE86B35FEBF4B8C60
to-night."
0x6FF6D5548D644E74576624421994AF3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x7CAC314824F316EC8BEB0302F05D3757
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0xCB7D767DA83AFA1F26E27766F9B8198D
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0x1816BB2A37F21FE41B0A3D5CC79F3C33
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x6CB562686C3215F3647808A41A37F2CC
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0x4AD0BC2D5247854F631E10563120FE09
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0x23408C66987A8477880477BBF748EED0
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0xFD169833997D773C8C7E0B3027C9553E
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0xB297183BDCD442802112C21DF13A6D26
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0x5A7295C6C1CD2D2A2DE86F7A43EC795C
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0xAD148D2EF9F494167586357A1DEDB6EE
confidence.
0x4D9907745826F79E6EC5A17000490A5C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0xDA0E5F045D2330619E128FA902D0CB47
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0xEF6D2D3443F1549B0D7FFF6D50CB6BC4
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xBB16470F9345F37DBE9BF24A80698E31
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x84C38CA65B4F843D6D6E060E81A3644F
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0xA8C33AD418CFCAB9CCAA7D2B2BA84A2B
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0xFA0FBEB2324FCA179C60EA839CFA077D
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x6E82C4D483F383FC9C458BB2F9730832
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0xDFA380F591100EC1422D565FF9AF784D
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0x60DF57525707A7334F6B459B4466407A
you--therefore speak."
0xA89D363A8CE580E75A305A741F7651EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x308454C1DED479EABCE4DF4B3162ED47
smile either.
0xFCAC82542D1A3C8F181D2BD20832109A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Speak," he urged.
0xA5475B7629EEEC39BFF5D498C2ECAAA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What about, sir?"
0x3071A48BD52EC46F927063A6ED24996D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xBF72F1BA4273995D762926D282B956B1
treating it entirely to yourself."
0x9ECB253B779B47E8764C8546EF288A99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0xA0AF3FC3B2817D646D13B63AB903C322
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xC43323B5A74FF312B0158A610B8121F3
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xE92D912C50505B493E282AD8CF432A0D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0xFA73EBD2FEF7EAE69D09E00CE59925D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0xD41ACABFEA3B5D7ED77555175C92103C
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0xE5241B8665DBBEDC16894F8654F67347

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0x1FCC3EE5D9BC08B5B92AFCF2CB753BEE
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x290061E4FD075014E774FC3716FDA303
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x853AEF7560197FD71C72524953829C0B
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0xA418F24BCE1A8E1E98EAEF6E84B2CE0A
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0x8CA7E227A31BFE7410A275E762886F36
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0xB91CE7D53374E9CEAED5CFE3340A48F1
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x6D6F1D37D271C6CC030946F3930F9761
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0xE20B1B282129AD64CC9FC201FBE2A996
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x76278F26132F2E86CDE150309687014F
rusty nail."
0x9E3B3AD29CF8F299FD780557B186EDBF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x63A8E98CE9DC83F902529CE94E907C99
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x14276197DC8D5D88C89F8FF6253607F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0xF251D01790C838770BDC8E837FF52170
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0xC725B37D805A1BE31F5E9D95B2C36640
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0x93F05AA8CB88DB0489A3BF86FCA8E71B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x2998352F9AE3E3BD138F334948A99ED1
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x187911814EE1A7EC8D5F7B396D7B4BFE
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0xACAB45726FC5690D03DFBDE5A80523E8
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x76D13B185C763EC5EFF9B1DE66447BE6
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x170CE2221A7907EEFE45AE1E67031185
people in one house?"
0xA9E91913486A16F8BAFA12733B5FF12D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do as you please, sir."
0x6D2D9397811267310E4D4F90BD0F30BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
0x6A78F96BC09463440FFFE178D1A04EA2
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0xD6E84036614279B1D583A57C0D5BB50B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xB18F6F1D3A2EFEC747D3C72AFAD8676E
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0xE268B8A4C253FA38CDEBEE712246527A
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x7148E705D527F52E27F5629D5238A649
and experience."
0x145A8D1E1BDAA131DD2D2826D2079D76

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x6BA27B4603EE985E2F45564C53CD8534
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0xB49A5729C674D7EF70696C0B0868C2F7
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0xADD72D0CEDEA019E63A8639973BCDDB8
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0x186B07C6F6C1B31FE495118D36135C50
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
0x45D24373207143B199FF7F43B869ECA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0x4BDFE3264098B60FC4777B3446443DF7
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
0xAFB31B78A9ABE05972414B8437CC7C9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0xA82E205EAE33B8AD57B5FAFC729F6BBC
expression; "but speak too."
0x234E483103D6B861FACDCDC1074EC3DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0xD5BEF918995616C62DC2F02E0B14EEB5
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xA5C68BDD2C2DDFBEB68E93912EC0ADB0
their orders."
0xA4147AE2B408BE8A5AD68DCFDF576658

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0x7AF5A1EF947154A0149A16F14AD55C92
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0x1CD90BFE455119609742444C9C524041
you agree to let me hector a little?"
0x7C8662A0A6767794B2349DAD888C2CD4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x093D5A9F9B924CB8001C2F12CA1978A4
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0x47FB7CFBAB8AA2CE96B1254AB90658CD
dependency, I agree heartily."
0x4ECBEC014A2FACFF39DE07F6FDD5924C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
0x1E03CBA72CE3BA5199F1E6EC086BDAF3
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
0x60582215506D831D6B0AD9259F8855BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xB21854D6A78803E3C6B78494DE66F6BE
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0xCDE909D9F6A64FA59D79CF756C51982F
salary."
0x4DE85427837FB0A993D98BD75C33CADC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0x9421D10C89D517A00DC8DF7F8AF4CA2F
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0xB624DE1DA92983E334ED01C1D41A8839
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0xFD1B33DDD517F9DEFCCDCE67EFB20DF4
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0xD5017662EB3BCE55E7B38FD559395851
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0x342ADDAF9B281C38D8305C455B7A01B3
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0x7267CBEC6FCFDF17844B6BE1C5886673
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0xCE78ECFA72C470AFB62D1F828966D89C
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0x4A07F7AA68C22A31CF69276A243B7D70
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x71AE47A3E0456C43D18F2184B40A40C3
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x409D77797FBA1D2D65A6949C9C8AAC74
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0x6537AF4DF8816DCFE5B7ED65576B38A0
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x37670871B43131D9141FBF4FBDF8CAC2
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0xD680DE41ED64C5DF1A0502E936346428
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
0x1F8EA698BCADFD4C2004E6379C7282F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0xF8D61512BA408A431D1CC1AF147905E2
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x902A4068AF0C3660B8508F350EAD5657
as well as imagined--
0xE5E2A32941EB86774D06EC3CDCC44C7F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0x9760E41411B257E71272E7B166BD964C
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x9442ED65D342C7F67462737AE26DF3AD
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xE650D04235920B8AAA9B15AC2A7E9D1E
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x9EB028D2A2CF338D73C1FAB1C3D2E1E0
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xA62C1E2A168FA61EE1547DE45909641E
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0x0C94A08D5827BB9AB101D171364B6D7E
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0xDDF51A299560DD9FBE31F1E7F4F727BD
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0x92D5641C0E8D9C4C8033762D5C69A11D
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x649532EDB1B87E0E3D2C1992EE276E2F
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x14A7927BAE50A4CF32BEE6BA70967F7D
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0xC5748D7E7F189D2A565BCB57FBE43881
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0xDECBDCF38478FA69664A86456D63E9BB
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0xCA1771A24E114B65F529956FCBBEA4E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
0x24D11B8534E5BF442B8C78C6FB8A10A4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x9AE8AEF612B3C243C4BB2E31A6A1D84E
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x54E4B7F06994508D1E0744BF92C98291
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0x145BB48E338EC81BFF932CFE5700F231
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x2A9390E8247C3FE92B13F269CFF0B1E6
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xB8132C0A9AAB0BC39210E8B4C2B8E817
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0xDAE093A87F6B515232EBBCE2512805BD
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0xAE64F4BAE0D80DE11101980C88156AEA
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x27CA084BDC95811CE5A99A548ABE9E47
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0x251FE5EC4597C9E24B47444F76FB9275
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xFFCD8325B2B2743F23761688F27DDB3C
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0xB5997E1F4DDB71A418646F9B0B8F4337
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0xA220ADF0B2CB6DEBDD28D495B559C985
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0xF3FE6C8503AE7E3D7D1D8563F8F7C060
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to

0x834E29E0EC177C3263F2418717BD8261
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
0xE1002EDBF2FDF5A8A4FFA85EB13E678E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
0x4BEBBBF7AD66D935C51527FB3E7ADC93
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
0x689B986BCD309E33F67E2379AD47E97E
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
0xB55799754B08D03E32C42AD44538C468

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
0x3D7228C063266351AD60D733E05CE55F
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
0x0F8251B9426791B2563693B7D050E404

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
0x1F36D362548A49E0F4AA796FCCE5E535
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
0x97BC6F0C9D7106A0F023D0003E68D463
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0xCEA67E364B6B4128740188D0BC9DF38E
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x88A068F8F4970DFE92ECD17EF82BFA3F
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x8C013F018AF6B472164BE87472F6845A
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x35938C98FAE0A8AC5D49E72BFEDFA323
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0x55DCEE33445B5F3948AF8933B2D3D54C
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0x731B7FD1091BBCF39C4742F0C96A299D
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0x38B786F1595E4E3DA28D4C0D1A4149F0
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x22200930BB1F2BACAAAB1B3B37069DB5
Good-night."

CHAPTER XV
0xB5ABC11437405745B608B37329565277

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0x54F9239D636CC29FA4A23BD7A11BE303
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0xAFFFD97B58DF6DF91189424262BA0BC1
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xD78927C056C161DEC7ED624F656775FA
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0x6B9E947D58B8479182E28C0534C16AC5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0xC5BF2469DFB831E66A02687F9F0E2A96
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x9230BD9F423831FB6136758C70F016EC
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x781924BD7ECC173DDD6ECA2822D70530
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x01CDFC48A38EBBA1D5804DC4DE3817D6
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x7E05D9A9AE76F900A4A7CD19A87BADDA
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0xBD5218F235377613BB5BA431D26FFD3F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x19328FCB62798B8B278D7A88E37F2B3B
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x90580ACC0ACD83EBD36FA40D3A6DA3E3
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xE3E36C862926D70A225F9A32028D3FFE
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0x96D77E38A86EB116DBDD5423AA79DC2A
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0xBB4D155F323FEF9A8F8FB22410FE0DF6
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0x906E6802DF4345822128F59E69A48817
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x29393996728B79C9B908589034F10C55
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xCD0B2EBE1ABA3CB09FEA5B9ED070E860
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0x0169DD37772552E519936D7035789B26
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x3ED613F8C461C2E5A121546F13B93DDE
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x4661C97D009F94712482D31882A853E0
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0x7680843E6339261878D418EEC82908E3
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0x726E13A907C1796EF4AE27E11405A3C2
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0xEC4453C1A636086D38BC9A6990A726ED
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0xB5FAA0BAA3C3F93F4E71C65B183AA3A3
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0x8B5E866A8866E5F17E2DD5ED812254D4
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0xC544B9460E9BDF601AB538586A3BB33C
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0xDB0B8F8489344C153EF4CEF727D0A6FD
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x5E153CB5BFF841A7C4BB0CFA1D94727F
now, if you will excuse me."
0xBA5DA2680FE5C2BEC46FA92748F7C335

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0xF4C0A4AFF3F37F2EC1EB3E8F491DD2AB
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0x0527E95D6C19E470CE1CF2C17C356F42
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x12C008982F705A4CAE23F4E0F7D6B191

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0xB29BE655CEE796D07D76AE7287B2A2FA
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x635C84D90A82739BCA85661A31CA100A
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0xA1E843E0AF4FBE8FA0FDE771C5A9B16E
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0xE84878BD2C2CB373C222BE1C1AAC858B
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0x7B77CB239D82683726ECFF69D9DD7EA9
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x051AF23A7C1AFFB1B3DDD5A46AB55C71
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x41B2DE64159A3E3EDA10A62587D3C5E5
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0x2EB86DB2ADFF41BC76D6F35DF1AE79FA
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0x02A1378F10A298CC5177715B7FFCD476
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xD9ECC3297A47CA143F306EBCBA2EDDC2
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x498AC2C777FEE9B93C0D3621EF6B1E88
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0xFB938E919B0EC9D88B620806C1925D92
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0x807E5BF238E9D8823EE726F9767864FF
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0xC0001B65F6E621D32813A26D697148D3
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0xDEB0A5C020CEA56EE23B6CFF292B52D1
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xE66ADD2394828B3F1F8EC2FD19512E87
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0xF99B3D9F8DD47DF42F7D7FC67BA7E700
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x7CDCAE62DAB5948B53C6CD71A8F07C88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x100E28B07011042E153C8415E0219B3D
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x1BA9E6D8488694A9FE48CC86A19C9F05
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0x60D4D5ADA9FBC227AB02D01B27B6AE50
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x1652FD58A785C9D81E107D15396D674E
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xB26BA846C4B457FDCEBE6A54D683D878
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x72B419BFC14E4D69AB84D7CF0DBBD55D
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x7A7A5F7F697BDED0233955116F0E0308
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0xC1F513B48A5FD191812D84708625BA0E
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0xDDC3ECCABE563D636DC87AE11B213F61
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0x0EA5036ABA5A1A0D27BD0310F631F13A
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0xBC1B4441DCF9111490FD961DAEA1B16A
current--as I am now.
0x598BBA89B12D65697AFEB74EA2831381

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x6B61F16243A9AB6A0EEA15826EF9C09C
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0xDFD0E0100912A8D1D45D68E78F7CF745
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0xDDBC3606EFF13819853146E6098D38DF
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0x021BF2305D2761AFA7932DF5504FBBA9
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0xC29D7788E4E22DF971873E15186CC6BC
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0xC23B1A7D9098DA64F7EB1DABDBD7EF70

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0x2C115CF08D9E82A0AB7AD46934ACB085
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x958328FC73E367365FC6E7C38DBB711E
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xB5C36C1BDD78F1636DE630E7AF612E2A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0xB4F19A4CF775BD3505AC99AFC803FFFC
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x63BD4AF2F5EA7866054D681A7E1DF37C
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x4462499B23B897B1016B904FD9CEBB4A
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0x27523AC916B1238B6FF3CDEB811A00AB
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0x165D7B002177952AE8B4F363132471F1
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x79EDCA0A264E16566D934C07812A9E27
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0x3DA636CDCF16AD312B8A22B2D55D95FB
his countenance: he went on--
0xF4E7C88CF21809E6ADF3B9D6A7C3ACBB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x080989EBD29B604C017147F913640940
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0xA214193E15144FF3D2CEB1BCB60A5523
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0xE6002E304F4AC2CA8A34667930DF2CB1
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0xB3909ED8ADE311B37C1BAEEE8D80F298
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x9EB0860BFD9AA4485E49B3580CCBBBBE
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0x733EF3855D683630BA26DA6B775067E2
if you dare!'
0x8DD2DF70DC9D8E04503C770BF14E5FA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x3086B3E30E881B7525FB55888A161913
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x84AEB94470B355C0028968D18069EDB9
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x3FE89DB0B9DFFA0B8BF37F5968C6E84C
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x61C0BEB9FC2467B6730830F0DF46FC7F
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0xD6B060B2EC82B84734B1423873D6D7CA
but straw and rotten wood."
0xE1AE110315D95BF7F67168BED0A86AAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0xFFA8C6F7DA9EFB88F8706804573182C3
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x068F0975EC1F9F3BA2A34F6DE575D929
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0xA0B4576132674B4E56956A26E57E60FD
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0xF11148073D4A7E306DAC5BB8B8E72FD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x505BE1B24533EA1480DA60766DB33766

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0xCC9E229E32440158DD2F49723F210FE2
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0x9BFC4AB85AD0C5E3FC4CB83B3E2DA262
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0xB83DF638F46C02EA5BA511AC186353E4
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0x16E1D36F378F787EC15BD3AA8497E3A8
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0x03E84BB194364F84FF307797C671D6FC
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x2F1C1B662A4248672522DED3A39DA889
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0xB05F5F1656FB915226B4F31B3423B8EF
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0xB10F71F34BC49D5CCC9602708F0E7A6B
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0xFFE2D233C05190E7792027A595020254
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0xA60A25152D27F9C6DC863E294DB42697
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x64F56CD490372346732553E94D81E0F2
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0x8A3B022638C22C6FD41E72571A590BDD
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x5665F516C84A1547EE902A822165FB88
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xCABF09624E19A571878FDB53B6D10956
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x892FC33164BCF52B9782773636CEB5EE
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0xAB37BD64322592DA78DDECB5721B5164
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x5EBFA460F83312CA07254B57AE81261D
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x0FCBF4E7DC0CBF614CB1E1EAC6C4E314
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0xE978C0696494894DC1C5A86043D54EA2
After this digression he proceeded--
0x16995F0C126E140A4EF3D3608DD67F32

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x156AAD736770371469352C2B188E7E70
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0xCF3211CCF1927FC01FB0C4C1F55C0CC8
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xFBA26319E3E504781F21955B0F7C3004
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x4F39CD94656A236556E87457BBD2187A
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0x0092170374276A4B932520491EFA0FC5
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0xF8A777C05FF93E2CDBD46E127F3F39EA
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0xE4AC74A2FCD6E22E3D2E694589247A18
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0xF2B27663120829A04A0B84FA4F7ECA46
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x8B5B83416CB831EF5CE9EEF6CE87491D
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x649BE68FCF8F3068CDCAAD776129891D
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0x3C26768293DC8FA97CAF8BEC8CB1321B
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0xC8DDA2F478681405FD98A31D81351EBE
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0xCD92DF5FB596085295B61606BF0DDE3C
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0x7F1966C30E886DCE965ACFE65DCA5A17
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
0xA1D971A375AF46B3083DB66160ECA5E8
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0xD124057614966E273C28A55B31B2A0D5
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0x7A0151054956D17CD54EFBCDFB8D21A9
who had been her dupe.
0x0C239046C7F283AB4840EB2E0B340164

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0x52D2091B4FEEB4F15F4576AA91EF82A1
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x84B5D6918E8B8BED6F502E8B6F8DE0CC
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x71A52CA2E63174B8FBDBEB4E8FCA048C
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0xE9160BE0B232DC3D7EA1E1C715901115
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0x1C5E9CD507225B8C1CE4825227332A95
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xDFEF9DEB13EE2EE1BA932A4CA791EA95
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0x9E3B399955396986515145863B5340F6
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xFE7B3FF6D392670A1350948BA90A074D
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x10870BF1338CA5570276416E99A264BD
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0xAEFBD86ACC34B7DC880F3C4819A1B764
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x97524B8D8B101E113ABD87ECE6B197F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele here came running up again.
0x6B07A6F3ECC81CEE965447DAAC356CC0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0x12085F7D538B8B81C093478D3011A7C8
wishes to see you."
0xF6F7521AE121DF87C12CE0B4A5D71296

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0xEA9503A7DDBDB500240A11CF0E116655
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0x6695671AEB409B9576314CA78AED2EF8
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0xF7EBAB2D8E7EC112DD1E64B7B0B289EA
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0x24FC86E4626FDF0B152506BBA8B86BBB
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xB601A381590888780B6D91554EA6B725
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x416783C789BFBFD5BC7DEF7E15150C3A
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0xA8B52B7B346273FC8907C7033782CFC2
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0x790A697963663044A6465159995CA88A
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0xD055A5D7076D0C0FDC102681AE6CA17E
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0x50559AF1D2FCDC24AFA80D2A356C95F6
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xF36667E6BC71A0435A6023F51400C29F
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x89D42CC6FAE4D39A4FD529F9F2C643F7
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x267FD9E8D2A74E8D9D34B135FABD4AB3
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0xF60706128041A732953FE3C0755B82E2
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x3DFE535BF95D92690EAC2132C769FD29
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0xCC130EEAAD5C52C18363C2C54481B3EA
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x4A84EAC6B3D6DA289A8AA9A5FC118102
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x42F259BAF965DC4CA3A2D5B15C21E3BF
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0x2D50313E344A35646605DAF15D412B91
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x792A11CA2E5324BD22C4FEE9AE720557
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0x3F148101BC7E62EEDECF3C11778AF753
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0x7E6A3E55E8D04DD695A27A5216B53393

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0xD68AF578FB4EAF376A64401894B412DE
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0xC18A9F000E25E7E4CF04D2FD6470E4FE
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0xAF018C98DE38A0F08DA11EF812BBBFC5
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0x8B0CCE22215CE2DA2FFB527137DC02AD
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0x1DC060DFB5ED17667F140AC9412FD473
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x4CD7A246C454F4D890724CAE08D6227A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0x280E322B6835ABFBA3E94AFE088135B1
you too: it darkens."
0x1CFBD122D190D84D956E85A210E6CC89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xF1C628B3F3ADB7FB4B959FB12AD14825
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x37020A185F4DD8B9973E85B03C25D5E8
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x6C7348D718572EB5625CDAABC5228BE2
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x9C41BBFF43B10ED938FE20129D03A8AE
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0xBE74BF26CC6CC942A104EF29E2852A6D
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0x65C169B712889BF8436F134C0D86AFF4
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0x719F7DD89E06A6D4EBB2ADCA76DF44BE
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0xF0BF0B971FF77634F6E1E261417C4407
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xD8BF2943E4783AEF39D2BF2D8D00A1DA
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0x019CF10CD48DD57F399C9BE5C2B8E476
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0x0F941BC5813DB8AA8BE505A95EEEC049
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0xB0F57348CA54AC26AEAF756BA6908111

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x781BEA8664E01BC9E17A47B6C4F60949
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0x4383BFF27448C0347A8F7277EDEABA85
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0xBF1C2A9C28A36C63EC70AD39A64C5510
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0x7FE57B9233CFDF0D4BB8DA591C2600B5
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0x4C528D38FD19113D5869CA23A3F439B1
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0xB0F5D35CC1E1D94350E4AFCB830CC0DE
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x415C64C8AAB1D35D0A280051A87572EB
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x2B20BC9FC83985FFA719D48ECBF11FFC
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0xBFF25159E18D24D9434F9683CDA173F6
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0xD61BE035FFD4273AAD6B49D016DFCFF0
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x09F9CB0DBE619517178BEC3B3240D1D1
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0x07F31A74822A3904B7ADB9D7CBC5EF90
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0x2B652829262D4F9FA587590F2C79DCD3
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0xDB3CC34FFDB3592050DBE884C62210B6
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x79C7FBA67C269E120ADCD12C2BEAEBED
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x017F7C0D746CA97FC9C31A03EA98CBCB
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0x977DF0C43D0B8751A1B7A16EE98B6D4C
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0xF9E3A9FBCC6BC371E6B8C220AEE674BA
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x8A93C2638B6969FB3B261D3FDE197F85
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0x3202BFB1178661F44ECBFF78B41EA056
benefit.
0x54AC9AD9E8A7A4A86AF039EBDC217C7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x850CF0D04246528A0B3446E867BEB9BC
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x006FB6BDCA0D8C7E8476FBC7BAEFA55F
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0xC11B0CADC0EFAA112E8C69962AD3A192
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0xA499E23C6A632A3527015DF8CFA371CA
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0xB32CC53A0FD0B67FC7C757BC7CA1B75D
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0xB7FDCB5CD6E93B761F32FF2BAE3F3C1B
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0xA18EDB79852E8BD995C34BAF1AEBCE43
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0xA73D43C4F72E29934D61244D4F8219AB
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0xB4D2926BBDA3DC3F57E131C9C041B2F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x9DBC9702954BE2D859EE4742C75DFA82
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x6A3C4825FDB3EF66693590D9AD6263CC
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x4D58CA9F182E519F26AF75DE1A83E10F
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0x3E1C2C18D7F1E5A0C4B2B8464337AFE7
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0x005E5D8CCF4C169C6D5DB112B137782C
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x63BFC3030E3237608A87AA5AFC54A0A8
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0xAAB52FEC50567FDB2B2805C1FC6C257E
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0xA529B8EE8314423D4EE510D2BE7072BD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x83D1E74113B2D9CA601CB5383BC70343
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x74BCAC7C1973987B560B9CF87E024CC6
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0xFA7E79E5D4FA7992AAB9973A6D515812
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x960F7DD3CD0528F1CE3F4CCE344797F3
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0xD1063729C44F825AD138785A8031717A
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x69DD42AA8ECF375A0963AB2248178C72
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0x3868DDC1362E2CACD4152EFDCBC860CE
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0xFF6F3E9FBFBEA67A55E1284AEA2DCD57
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0x4D4B4E1E244260D676AA1A185155F7E5
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0x75D870B811415E9565B9A085388D3A38
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0xD432323759A6482BE9531EEA21083528
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0xEB1319309EA01713EB793130DFFF54B6
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0x9156C68A15E051604BFD92E324CA475D
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x30B3788AB9D8B9D293F68079212FB4B2
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0xC7ACC53E942DAA6228325E7F9A7E8BA2
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0x5397142147DFBBF1FF25F3205A5A927E
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x627EFDCFF2C3C6D1553BD4A2C3CFF413
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x7303426A8BD7D4C765500C4C25767841
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0xDEAE8BFF149DE773944A06C4F0CBD72C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0x0EAC235AE782D06AC9247417B21C99DA
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0xC494F7151AA7CD1BC9C1902779471E74
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0xD26DA063D6B13FE05B445A8A21F43075
Thornfield.
0x7211A33F32CAD71BC01FC9FF58042550

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x8A6BD445DC37BD8ABD9C0F0CAEC9CE8F
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0x4FC6B04FC94EFC65E2F3D4208B8DC750
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x3BFA1051D496B46D7344A4E08DC8030A
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0x34E65B86D8D51639B612C33A97F8A161
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0xF6F70880CA721C36146FDAAC6C1650F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0x7342A120D1E1BEB7F5EA4DF2AC3BAA9E
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x6720CAB5E1BFE406054334DCC4626B57
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xACBF7B9604C3AA4E18A57E46C0C0EAEC
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x0BE6EC883EFAB43B999A7B0CF306C4EE
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0x83412706A8A0D3B53B67EDC65026A850

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0x9FB6E3F61BFEB217EF3CC90C7DF53189
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x98E664F9FBA24E9A812A666B27EE4B0C
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0xC68A4C75AFFD6DE69529F85AFA9B1023
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0x7C78A8266C69033160D27F218E6E6EA0
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0xD5273BD3C79F2DD07F5B43F1DC091384

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0xA4D128E82ED98788FE50682DAB917777
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x4535DE9C1B5F525E03E07EB512407AF3
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0xA9571AE974153D0CBC826E371D6436EB
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0x82BA2FAAF12CD0A4528C2103D8C899E8
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0x5D6F52D276954E485AA92A1EBF0F4973
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0xB4F7118F6D872BA69DD67C1F929CC0CE
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0xC3BDB231A312EB7DE3EC097B85F9F5D9
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0xE70748DF56365F498F6FA70CC02136C9
enough.
0xD557E232D557E232996C6F33DFC4756A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0x76AF85F0913C399B620E0B2965173370
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0x836A48B774D6D8E8F3E028F3FB7CDAFE
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x835A0DB259CA0A47D5A1987E597E5E91
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0x30C34833A1873A2CC2FEFA1C40BCEEC5
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0xBBD384FF2E33C3B636668C0B911628AE
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0xE132982EFF039A8916E5BB2E8CF08B07
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xDCA6AFA71E8C03B525019A18AF76AE61
there?"
0xB05D6F5CB05D6F5CAE3780CDC0E2C9F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x9D6BF31E0C0B8F5DEC97EECCE78DBB7C
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0xE24E5012E2F088E875AA4EEECA1F4201
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0xA067BD3E8F3BC6DF4CE973DC34586E7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0xD4685427E902DB67BDF1BA82EB14B7DF
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x88BB25B5A3633E23397B1724827CB86D
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0xA8A6158788F5F1758355FF8F6C3E7CBD
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0xCF49D416B68D57BC0682558DDA7A51DB
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0xB2C35C128E044B2E0E3A2F181CA7A427
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xDEBFC90DAD52CD2A118C14A1BD3DE968
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0x17464781DE60D09D97688488C8743E7F
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x483398A787D0EC9599D37A3E97D7095C
burning.
0xA5CC17188F7399D26D05672326CAE2DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0x8CE00B7AAA906E360536433E883D51F9
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x6A503E155DD362972A5AFF645A7DA3D2
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x6526BEFB5B4E5D974628A87C7FBBD479
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x533D38F5328533DA1CB9808E954D267D
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0x6D45AD205EB7852EB933E2A01D52E6C7
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x645BFF780135C18BB072B9578DBE47F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x0784FBAC3F7DA8137B7746911177F195
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0x59DEB9C5F5F96B5F9338582607702454
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xCE0AEC97CAEC429A9E08E38D7CBDAEC8
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0xC967989F8E7FD37767DE4C3ABF8C93A0
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0xC6D63754E246D6510BD2A05CC294DB8A
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0xFEBAE9961618746470A0FACE5C782016
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0xC9A758098AF34BCEE2EB2F1AB450BBA5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0xB803085FC763C0B5443CB469C86F9CB1
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xFF7A9A4869F929039DB4B86FCF4F97C5
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xAFB173C5AC7BCC98119633C0F6238037
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0x7B0D26531B38E34C2165009B313B643D
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0xC75965FF0FEB188D0A1D68147A013F4F
water.
0x68A9E74068A9E74071583ADC7772430A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0xC45B5B3C4AA878AC8D30B0A7D8481B7D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x3130CD85837066BD3F8813B819AB1D71
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x4CBA02D2B9703130819908B15D85A258

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0x915AE4AB29A210B1098537A2E3A3FDD0
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x55C79A79EF4883D2A0BABD3F7B9E2FEA
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0x7022003BEC962C5C273FCD13482FBC94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0xF8478036AD487255AFDF90F1C78EE481
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x245AD7A4D3AD1CF3937E8DC8FDB81D91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x3B174629B4C2068D26ED69718BEA3A5D
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0xB9CEE22A6B990964BBEB455B71F72BA2
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x5ECCE07A1529FB5A8F0E9FB023A174C0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0xF46A14335736062E9DEB5C35C692BB16
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0xA6EA0D71A760794DB0B683AF32CEC68A
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xC25A29DD667D57C7ACD547DDA0C74A90

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0x3C95390220B8EF00A7ABFF949D1B1DAF
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x75FF4503F28D4F689CDE6F970B7A03BA
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0x19EBD4EE6BF6BA1968F96593B71BF8B2
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x129A0520D5BAC5E4E3A31E4B1796929D
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0x7ACC058D3D1841E09B39CA2113B08B8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xD8B0EABF8748AA74FA2372E248D502EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0x52431DE775F0354E68569FD4205C20FD
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xC783DD94920DF6C297A66452B88C8BD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x24E53A53BC07DD475028F1A0FF93A8BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0x3D3E105EBA52A1576F92C289ED04FED8
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x84C0CA3D5DC94A4854425EB9A564388F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0x8672F5BE6E7075E0D355461DA4681440

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0x8A86113B659E2A79FB7CF36ECDAACD7A
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x319DA1FD9DA96FE6206B1BD9612B5006
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0x9E927F1EA575DA4262738F00957801FA
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xD1C0FEB866E3FC5A493437653D78C143
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0x254FA0F559D111AB235171E8DBEEDAED
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x4B84265712058DD3B734ADB3689884A4
move, remember, or call any one."
0xFFDF0AC6BA1C5C540ACF71FAC86610D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0x92640188AF68C139C18EA20B76FE55AA
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x1C11C30D78179DBB7C753B57CF8A0F3E
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0xFBAE1975BBF8C218DEF02FB769D2721A
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0x7FF112522D0D9C69A2E0D15D37D08F8B
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x17A2317A0F0DED38F1D48981D963798B
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x23F1FD448024257C49321BD8CBBAB133
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xAF4DEB3DEE03DDF12391C1EEA5EA7F6C
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x16F8C5CB808C0069E7A37F9438320B51
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0xA1C59B603C9B78A7C7E38C95F125E02C
"and not something worse."
0x8AFEF67A9E2BA05072232DFD404476AD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x8965B98F88BBA8E97BD0DFD6649F24EC
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x5D081F2F724F7943D7306DE48BF44F3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How, sir?"
0x17110B3085A0D80FC9D79811280C52E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0xC9B5C4AD49DE67BD467D282CBD81F8D9
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xCB6678541F9C854D4B4D09C5C3A538CC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0x5B3247EE7D0E34C5350905AB664BF3DC
door."
0xF211D74AF211D74AD175657614B15676

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xEE04C8BED3D1E8AA279CA685ACBC7E8E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xA22846B5FC86E15CD1C8240E18C91693
think, or something like it?"
0x77A107103A915A585CBCD907CFE9C1BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x80EB74ECF78BDDB179C5C9A5668A13C4
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0x46E921DAD6B98871C4CB8D6A2A38E3AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x41C5FD392391125FD9EDA749DA8C72F7
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0x15D921E8F9E3A8E9C22457BD2D2EAB31
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0x26C0093192DC8196B56AEB579089D218
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0xBBCE958BCA006B436BFE6DD2E81D0541
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x6743BD22EFE88DCAEA1E34F3623C8388
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x30B334EBF64280DADC342AFEC34FCBF0
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x3A4D862EE25C6E0BBCDD9C34A3046E18
hours the servants will be up."
0x3B90DB8EDFD7B3397799C479F16EAA89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x7FF5CE47075FFD7023DD297A22ED56B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xBFC115112A021847D67A22558B5B84E8
go.
0x4F7B9AAB4F7B9AAB4F7B9AAB5B355D8E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0x4139276F5FBF4E9F13BCD57AEB8E21D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You said I might go, sir."
0x5A6DD2238BB64E6BCFA8F0F7A687927C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0xB94A56E63DBD9CFE9D63A33499816275
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0x607FC23835E405BFEA890F1AB13BF440
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xC429E5A936319FCDC7FA9A35E0C2689A
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0x68FE50814B6D9A9C4B9D016D54FA1547
At least shake hands."
0xE5FA80659409037B088CCC291A69DBE0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0x6DB7BE1A87B06BB8B7AA45FB92C29455
both his own.
0xAEABEDC83B6D3F2CC9F27991DF159639

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0xD1D94952A079A900F235E443573AD5B2
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x3C25E72CBE380F97C66BC7A2BBEA564E
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0x25A9909BF0596A657E1753CF65D77AE0
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
0xDA8AB7896D79409E84B57F4733B9DB42

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0x1EE090FDA2BD0801BA9836064A8C256E
his voice was checked.
0x24747FAB6AEDC4CC55601CA291EBE557

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0x7667F78A724968528B3EDD002B90A3B9
in the case."
0x1C28109F191B318D5D097EFA7301EA1B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0xAD5DC572F7083047BD1F01ABB35C7DA0
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xE14D7C0E3E9EA40C364671469BB24E18
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0xC020EBC10C559D81649C303F85BB7877
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0x6FEB1B69BCD11BD2626BACAAAE5F0997
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x05022CE001DCA938FD9053BA09FE8BAC
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0xFC0E4749C46079E3D6C450D666A14B88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
0x037DAB923DFDD4FA445A5EA75958C4EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
0xEEC67DB412BC9A3CA14697FF9F3DBA7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What! you _will_ go?"
0x07C691EA7A9CA668DB7AF7CE6B1008C6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am cold, sir."
0x48AA262044404BC1526B43CBC4101B9E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x4F29C304F3E9D463D9B3B96787D70F55
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0xC53D77892907A2D7A0F0AB79C05C964E
expedient.
0xEE87C74B1B80809E6FB8C57FC408A95D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
0x6D5EDE5AEEAB3D5CBA8356B57632E351

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
0xE1068570F791AE0839DAE8F8893292B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0x0241640CCC8E00B659BB21177C93AA27
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0x40EBAB2A052E9D3DE442B66D1627A188
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xFE18F45BDFC08D825486A20E7B389965
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x065458E11B2138704814F93C0248E584
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0x5BA3C7A4BF7B9D8E4714AECD55C75DAF
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x31ABCDB4F2FA4ECADE21FF8AAF405170
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x80C3A285312529D3138BC1D59DC244BA
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.

CHAPTER XVI
0x90EC49850C74D8F0F13AD91E1639CAD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0xD35529423449363C17090B461293C3EC
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xEF7130B7A0C91D13A76F7113B6F64A8C
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x108C392029F04A1B89DB607FC5ED4CB1
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0xE8C776085FF080568A5A381FDD361AF9
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xDE5D717145F6B9F0389B016AA3916C22
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0xE97BC967056B68010EE29E4BBCCB0036

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0xCAFF8F50E3033140DE9F279480FE7BD8
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xCAD275D9A469C40F842958C2F47E7361
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0x2E8610A430A19266B5B9BAB0D936C783
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0xA8F4805F64557FF753B7CE21A43BD823
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0xC8676BF933EE421DB9293601CF0CD6D0
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x190D074ECD8688B634AE8817D74A29CC
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0x6EFEC8F85C1252C763BAF6D25AA25A3C
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0xD65B1CE6524873362102DD2F8EABAB0B
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0x4A47998E34814BD9E7C2449F221EC361

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0xC50F10AD8A7E3B30086C78CF028F0CE7
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x08623F5922D7CB33A121788292129CC3
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0x2AE3EAA48032FF6468CC98C80355370D
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0xF837A8991D449B8A70CCA57293B4531D
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x2264AA0E72B0F1CFF4849EE0FE28FB11
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0xDAECBD345944B7CE7180C9430DD9DFD3
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0x794B975F8889D2C6547FCB35C0A71A4C
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0x8A5E8529F708698E2A71CDD574239FD7
no other than Grace Poole.
0xD2B71F84497EF69AD3F468E23D232864

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0x5116C7C5F33760859B72002350D0E5A1
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0xE1F3134D24202771FE8B171B0EDD1875
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xD7F4F776F2B2D4A6F3B66D908CA46373
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0xCE79D7A52AC12357B49FB0011A576CCE
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x88F09FFCA669ABE2D3EC10653FF46D45
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x06061CA322AD76593CBD3B9E3D5B3158
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0xFA8C2B964CDDF9B04D9FC15086DDFFD0
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x2C60EFD130E5E765C3D223568D392342
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x18746BBA0D38FF4B95F5786229167527
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x0CF97F9E65C6F2D4061E96FDA2E8FEB7
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0xB38FAC1669B572731B489EAD9E1C9CC7
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x7F3364D9D5D2FB5F146207B214040F77
went on with her sewing.
0xD91DCE38CA66DE952E68AFCEA01435A4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x12736142E1215F7DA7C1C574FEF3F961
is past comprehension."
0x0AB62EA18A96CF5A2773F1C7EE89B3C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0xFB8438D4E494E2D74611425787FC6CF1
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0xD4D202A9886A4AF0F3BF615E46736249

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0xB65F65E144C537D09699BDC141DCEE7B
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xF48BF9164B71D32EC37606484CFF9C43
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xF3967B4CC6E4D2A49F113BD4BD4DF8E5
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0x4D18BE92560B5CB07817009B640B7450

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x859D7A2412C01BC400CFA618D5A2F421
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x4E1FD75BC16C1F70F7B3C0717835785A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0xCAD1349F7793FD96B139CC36A5D1CFCF
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x8C52EA3C0F2A506D7CE937894782D57D
she answered--
0xC5900F45825B96866102D43347CBE6C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x93D08567F48016901ECC86768FEBEA59
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xAF8E921234A95E850F938E09057F2F9D
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0xC6A048833E166ADCF645E86BA84E85F5
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xB51953D3C3916C4866FF3D0881A2384C
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0xC7207C3210FAB63193DE902D323B1275
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0x923B76F9E99CC58A5D29FC6CA49A4048
a noise?"
0x62AF01ED95475717A4229748B454FDCB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x32A61829957CC6579D5AF8C058DDB840
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x6AB6CFEF6ACE00779AF625826260C8E4
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xECAB6F52D3D52A9F22DED765C9398F4E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x842E9D92C9F5BE0CCDAFF10BB944E9A1
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x0323014E3119A5E4BA1A3AE8C25D5D62

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0xE2472E8F57E8905FA439AEC199448CFF
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0x3A8EECCA52CCF4BB31EA1E7383EBC85E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0x7466D1E55881B2283DA5B3681EF32E88
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0xF3854579560A5300F4307BB9506E30D0
conscious eye.
0xD838105612995C0C20BD27B6C6D6A7CF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0x3DD2EA598ECC5337F795E23D333E82F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xCA2AB12D489DA95DE86452A918EDCC7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0x2C68C5FED669D296B3118F1ED8B26787
gallery?" she further asked.
0xD0F9622D08123D8C93314E981EFD8C1D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0x98725B0FF8BC7567B2B8622504179CAF
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0x8762B20C4C460EA43D49D8741A31DB62
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x93DB941DE7B02DACE3DD7893C202CCF8
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0x96783571266105EF382A732368E48F0D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0xC0A3D9BCE914FE82F614336CDA5D7B91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x2655E563C97311093B9C2E35F01C851C
you get into bed?"
0x47DA793DAC76CE2443CB297AC2725CA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0xAD609BDE89CB98EA62C5756662A3FD9B
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x278D832628DEE234BC9F093B23117AC3
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0xFFA3EFDCE8711909879214C16A592E67
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0xE39A626DC26EB929EFF0E821B597A181
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0x590C449E42A854EBC60B4C19E011A525
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0xA0FB1C6D71D38BC611FC03CCAC4CE680
lie down."
0xE32DC843C039A193F3389ADDB5732D14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0x3C566458A5EA32A140C1167AF6E56FF3
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xC4CD6C3A15E5541AF9216B4710CE3CF4
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0xABC021285C2013C3D6BD7DBD1D6B191A
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xEDA0B5A76B497B50B2A32203F6547FA5
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x98DE6614CE210EFC09453D7372958E47
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0x6C861BF9D11AB1CA76F424564D93F640
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x84B6F33AD7789561D61AF1ACFEC02CF1
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x08D791AE8EFF0C1A4F1E049C5179E05C
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x7C399DB270BB5E2F3B79E6D6F7EC66F0
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0xA540F4048E9A6A6A94E8E942DF0AFB74
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0xBBADA6AF83AE9B8629FE0D9966436E40
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x12E4544E90EB3479E3DEA8928D6DD1EC
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x73068554CC24D6DD5CDA1BB330CD177C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0xA36975349E470BD9C1A0D5D30141A4A3
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x1E43D98A677D1E16F0B0EC952C556222
entered.
0x83FB99450BF5138AECF7710CE1160C63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x89475F58D4DB288A82BE9DAB8037A860
be ready: will you come down?"
0xBB23B85A55652E937E637463077F5EEF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0xEA95B005228B39B04743597FB4CB5C6A
carry it upstairs."
0xC1CAD020F8B020C7FAB1791DD5CFF24F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You'll have some meat?"
0x0B7B8F72EAC6F3A734BE6C8E9BF77B8B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x56098808EEC84C4F17FACB510E5EB78E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the sago?"
0x50165DAD53EFC201F5EBC514A238F3B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x4FBFFC6D203A03950F75A71BED1C11E9
make it myself."
0x9F99D1D035C114577A6E8672F02EA9EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0x51D5AB6317E83B1428F452C3471D9128
so I departed.
0x1A8E30101FD917C2CB3CEB5C3F346380

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x860F950C80E58C583154489694CDFE35
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x448E2F0928D207371C6336CB6F0102BF
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x9464B3DA7350A948F531E15B838397EE
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0xCB5E10B5CD2399F44089B76CD3182D00
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0xAB5CD916D99D2DA1451B763B797B26B5
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0x87E7FEB979C74EAD8D036FA28A9B534F
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x0F9D82D57AFC44042A24581FB72013D2
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0xBF887FC2D46FDB9D8CA13D71CEC78296
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0xFEE0A16AA28A147A778F54C692F995CF
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xF313EDC70C11F208FE9D8CBFB87E533E
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x28B93EE446909242668D3E2E00347CF4
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x8C7B44FA5F70DFC3FC671965E545524D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0x1FB97906DBF76C969FA0684C28F2111E
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0x0E5888065C4381A493FBEC2367763EB2
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0x4FD3B17CB0803E0E5E15AE55B7EDC34B
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0x29D6CD1A7E2048E5F22A9AB09DB03DD7
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0x0B45B3A06458487B86D33D96C14B06E4
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x6BB57A7A504E9F24E2E565994B502D1D
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0x51D08FA7C03F0085F018483AA3175276
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0xEAE270AC1115A283F4D5CD48080B3AE7
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x161794DA9C1A4C14C31A7F87062AAC0C
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so

sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0xF927D67147B54D2B31C486D2F47A3525
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xE5837FD7F140BE097D2F91836D780157
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0xD976C1AA209D760FE767437E2B30331E
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0xF45F5E0282615BF4FF4D2150E7666977
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0xF0BD8089EA38370BAD66A70C7781FB8F
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x82C59EC8B2131290E4C2EB9975696A2D
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x31857B57C92EB007BB858B56B2F6D0F3
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0x1B39B6B5C827D3667B165D08F7965609
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x03BFB7489AA62CAC95FAA90719591ACD
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0xBA64FF3D6DC196798C70D1321C8D42B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x414D9D4C020F0AF94E4A4A497EC43FC5
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x338BEE7FADDF79A20A35B2655ABEC3B4
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0xC6D6E815CF99C9CE13E202721E43E547

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x4F3A2162C51583571F32CB8DE7E84995
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xD757DD7B85D2B6B434BD9B4A1B4C07E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xC98486B01711563A2970E86B9EACB318
thinking.
0x8854DFA80A96BB45CFFF349E9932695B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0xA9F4A1504584135C2AFAD03289D975AB
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xE8688454C71DE7758AE05FFF08223CF1
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0x63F602A9235F74E70B6FD09D4A1382A0
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0xE5D9FA9855BA825BBBF64D19C0434088
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x0B5A994A9C72FF7044035D98A2F0DF9B
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0xD2682EB75A9A1AA60889B9FEF5A23F28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0xD59CCCF4767A2AFC3AA275421EAB3498
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x02D7265CE32FC008EE46793B2ADA9190
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0x08247243C5372371FD8B73E2BC885E91
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0xBB3705C3CFF86696612F1BA046E9D2E7
impatient."
0x900A5FE972A0AD81BD5286690679CC76

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0xD1BA60735EEDF1AC69D9467DA8BAFC42
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0x0B8A2742D6391A6156484FB34499B2EC
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x71C7B448410BC30FFD3EC09517A32C50
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0x5B9318A0DC66BFA16C73E6E88EFFB880
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0xD0D5D370738D48D78AB8CEB5AEE86771
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x966FF3AAE71328AE108838DB9DCD21D2
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x25DA2D843A535D063BDC85C39936E5F3
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0xF73FDF2778520C7592330E949592A33B
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x1434D9EA1C3B33BDE697947531E2A0EC
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0xF99B147F814E88F4F8BEAE707937286B
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x5550A9A259BC5EDB8527B900D0CAE6DC
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0xB37FA257CF7C2C9D5003ECC4D6B71FE5
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0x2BED9204CE6DF4D31A258723B6357B53
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0x59F80FAFB4A799CBF8D7ABA5D0BAE64A
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xD25C6F84E8FA7500C8F9DE7588389F85
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xE261639105C477B17C1A5B6E77AEF489
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x558F639E743034B2DEEDED1D0D7AC490
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x57C463197BA527083C7B5387B1B614B2
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0xA3AEB7E97A121152BEBDC4A6D8D36AC2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x610E7774973FEDDB28CBB56324A64BAA
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x4E206AD9C33B0CEA57D0D7FAB6B43F86
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0xF63D4EE46FB0131F30E40480908D85D6
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0xCD694B771966AC92C8FA77C02FCCBA9C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0xB1246A4A65CF299E1C26C4EA31B8A008
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0x43B79AA94E1BF11E577CF4FE7A50FD95
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0xD8B4F596F5438731C89EC78008FE2C24

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x25B8D74323D8E2910E1AED63BF5272FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0x5D90500A7B86ADABB8F0A2D0DB533BDE
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x497E12BB418B1E01A60AD790F4DD3D13
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x075C7B567707ED25655DC04B2675B91C
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x745BE1E72D400B1F5794E2E54F41670A
deepening into total obscurity.
0x1C56399C7A785730218047CD076CC20B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x5A00883C762A3A5AF675604FD9CA56DB
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0xA6D73C3D76C87B199E6F34DF6293A742
his journey."
0x080C800064E0C7DB95CE4A5F4C5E4898

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x79E0772ACF68377E6A9248FD229D18B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x8E0C11F1BE0F01F309F6B511938FA38D
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0x9DB50C4F675E22A77B708C8085E3B86B
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0x6DA0A420F41EF1E6CF77097AF28449DD
Colonel Dent, and others."
0xBEE78CC9A0E5C70489096250F34B5762

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0xFC2FA525A5E60DB78AF448EFCB56BCD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0x2DA33B366A51FC8EEEB3F944C01F1186
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0xDC34140D47EAF7B7C993D8F2A2A69132
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0xE800ACA40280F85B1EE48EB680D766E4
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0x417298E27B95AC278A4E877DC37F83C8
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0xE0B9D6AE4AA412390039A991ECD6A448
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0xA9566D52CD5C4621F4F81B3D2B888D99
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0x59E5040FE81B8E881E540DC5535E920C
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x44FC04E2AEE95FCB98EF2E919895B553
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0x2F244230020DA2F608DF38B72B4306A5
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0x90A11FDD0BDF32CB7CFEA806594FAF4A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
0xD9512B8E81AABF636B11A7D9AF06DE9C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x369B1C71434DC6011CD121E707B3CCAB
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0xF414B8C5FB6E22D08EC6EBC7E8A1F770
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x81D6992DC71EB3F8675E0EE1BB1E5369
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0x02988FC6C91168764878E1F9E3A67159
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0x7F7B5A4BFA9267031D4946C77550DA38
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0xEA40516E922C35D35CFA7141BD9563AB
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0xBD4604BF94CFBA0F8E89C2488EC813D0
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0x8DA6BFF1DCAB140FD2ADA34D2D935DB0
the evening."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
0xF62CCF3DB285BD84519FDF7F5A042268

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0xF05D19D54E80B9D14CEC792F9B5AAB75
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0x8077A90B72EE2769977781C787B08BEA
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0xEE5B51ED0595607BF8034340A4667B84
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x206EF58F5141BC3C44C1DD5FB31CF86A
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x3F7F7E1B69D0E21CD9C1A997729BFCEB
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x3204B850F09151255EF130403B2A8E73
was certainly the queen."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0x4B645F61C57B8E70E556A1E65E39FF6C
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x54C81C99DBB066662CEA7BBB98FFA48A
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0xDA7835B5479FD525ED44322C0D1579DE
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x0C97AB895B6E549522C56038C8621267
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x3187BD14E7D487E3A7C534598F461514
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xFE39D51A1C7579EA3E10FF0B742F0DCE
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x58BAEF56B814B1A4969607BE9876D5A3
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0xEE36DC690D9141BA29DFE1DFD92E0F9A
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0xB27F2DD6301348AA74177E5BFF675733
jetty mass of her curls."

"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0x90694F49754F111D393D0466246764A5
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the

"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
0xD0298D0A5CEF2BE9D841267C854AF437
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0xCBD3316489E728EF8444427BABDFF98F
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."

"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large

fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.

Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."

my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0x2E8100AD594F33D2963A0674052FBD89
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's

having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0x06E5FE1E8BC7F2424542A822F1D68A38
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0xCFA8791F87ADAFA9D5E2BF9AA4F8D43D
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x720DECA6105C8B5F52775B0DC01ADFBE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x7FF7024E4DCB4AD3790DD6A8B0A33031
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0xE23C2EA79DE791115071C5ABDF7F5D84
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0x99AB5128FAE16006D7166255629A12FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xF961E8C853EB8FAF5A8F7ADEC502475D
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x9FCEFB0F6BDC2C8431458D1850B3DBD9
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0x49538B2A734ED98EF9730FDD1EE62524
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x56859258169ED5EF594C5CE61F63D526
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x197623B2C784202ECE4203C8573DBEA2
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0xDBB54A3DC3AA444D2D806586D7B49B5D
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0x1461C854055C3B90C0B1115B8B80D6C8
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0xFE682FA8BD54898E50FF96E2DAA9E462
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0xC181049DD6DB2F7BBFD1BC6F454F8A67
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xACA75834EFFB99CCD10F6A01F033891F
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x87D7ED9591D878C72B0C10A7460E6ACF
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x881A00438D4983E3E3802232FCE97ADD
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x54DFC6C155FA02C60804F35A33D04646
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x5BB89D88BB46AA043EDD2BFFCECD2F52
is no extrication.
0x83E79B8C3B8B547B631AFC601CF60A06

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0xC6ED3E2435B036D5D69FCA8935C51AF5
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0x737D486171974DCE69242E50837640D9
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0xD92C526EA9926116C7C50D1E12ED7266
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x22C2227BF0FF252E8C4D7C0AB68C0AF9
poor, and plain.'
0xEF14481739F5ED00F4CF2801C8C248F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0x4E60DEE528D4B66181CA0A099E08C819
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0x37E90ADE9251351C116A01CC10D3178B
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x50296EB566BD24675D267FCD1355CA60
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0x84C61DC4DF3A7FE87C9BAA522F51ED96
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x68F65CE1586A6CCBDA287EA5FD262E2E
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0x6ACCF00832B49310F522E47C7AE8CA33
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0x5DB4B11E60371D965D7711735BA0C803
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0x230115BF9E39CE107F4459266568986B
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0xAD61ABE160D18F1580DA7C62D18E114D
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0xF1A1E0CB7C4E5E1998C14D1926B4802A
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x1D7FAC8A81A70F0A2FB908E1C033AD1A
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xD13112D66A5C69ADC8E06069F7FC797A
accomplished lady of rank.'
0xD0FCC8FEB32EFD371225946AD145E22C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0xB521D9A46B5D4F3AFF063496F890139B
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x0549A4919DFB72FFBACCD4DF15ABCB6A
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x10EE036D9CEAE8D7184C6B0E658F2836
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x2CF0F793AB88340C0B8D174E2B868660
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x4F048B447BAFC697F5609BA4DEBF3B5C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x2E36319E98586DF08D0C0E36AE484E0A
calm, and fell asleep.
0x930519F33B8B7E0BA07136DCC6D8DD46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0xAE713A0ACCBA447B5819CC550800436A
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0xEA6C9C138AE6F81B5180CD6CB0AEF300
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x17EAF82AAE47526B78FC90761EC79861
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0xFD4E17B107F0E30583B3C1F4BD516454
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x5BCA3490D029F58815D3CBC750129BAD
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x52903160FF0050D06B7CDA742DB1CB20
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x3A25D09BB253132783F04060D484C3E7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0xE907128CF74E9B69AEDEB2C94D4F6623
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x3A0F5728AD1916600462396B6525BE83
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0x8B7A696E5C4BCE10FD3E53981C08D4F8
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x96FB5116A9C9C0BE4B3DF226E33E36DB
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0x56F9C0A553F2A40A7FE8D8AA026C3B73

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xCADC15D18E5CD57767E233847D918E47
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x2FF306A7E877AF750DF38ADCA1B556B6
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0x3E3D38FF7985F6094D7A235F8FF5E299
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0xED7E3404349950ADC3BB78356406DAC4
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0x78E99B55AE69E98B6584A9C27F430528
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0x88C8AF28DE70F2DFBE56A05B90095EAE
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0x22FE3DC6941F1B34F55844106F28AEE0
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0x85942F94EDBB5DF3B39A8C329C997A00
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xC501D3CEE92A77B3AD2BB5A266E6F5E0
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0x372CA6396FDD62ED00F29A73120E9471
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0x8B06DFC8D9930656B62EC13243A0F118
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0xB568A1CFB39D0F269D792C3654547667
on the contrary, I just said--
0x422123BE888FE986E5071B15DB931ACE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0xAB9A390768C2EA81A8463477768C2A95
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0xAE68ACCAAD35F874C0126D52462A41B5
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xFB116A8A0E493CB99408D5789ED27E4A
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x8658ABF052018EE7F03A882450CEB99F
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0x21A743CA5E221EB3968ACDEA94103F59
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0x6D4F1665B39C1E3657029EBC714A72EF
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0x2A1D19BD6F8436BECED33415211FE51B
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0xAC3A73DF5DB25A5F3860186FF0E1BEC4
wanted and would be despised."
0x60DB7726F493C1BBB2E836E18F0D1A2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0xB7A5EC848DB8029E9870266DBB5FFD01
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x6C50431970E34D56E68069B8F1FDCBEA
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x60F3B243B737951C2BBB2C11260C6701
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0xA51CA7203631135F1B520CF2A10CD1DC
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x009CD7232DB911E51531340D373E81C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x2F2EAE4990180199A6BF84B417897862
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0x69BE2056866FE14ECA05344ED07F62BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x1916127E5EEB325E2B0F2DA4BADD31D7
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x73252D69B803F3578133C21F821D1174

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0x4BE3F8240A6CD643BA76C9777B0C36E9
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0xAA642E7895E2C365A04673182C76802E
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0xC02F4B32082876DBCE0A491400E2C177
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0xF5903AEACF5DAD31C04BF33152B1C2B5
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x3034F5F1A18348416D160AB15B3F226D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0x4EA6F1060CF4A5BA54C598AFA19F4F6E
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0xDBF106CC26A1512527C3FC487D15C172
holding the note before her spectacles.
0x026CEF14D478F65F41C6F078BD16BD40

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0x0F72F14F59AC14C1D6CBF9D16976FCDF
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x621CDAB2228B407CB7668B1C5A018D00
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x2139606D2F84A49BF38457CC9D421184

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0xD8661C942311611BC4A6E5EDEC71EEFA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x82E1538B8CBA9E74525DB02D12FD1A02
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0xED676E94BD087FAB8D03B04C2BDFF211
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x4FAB5A5A9AD49B5E825E792A46515E5A
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x61A9D0A1CBBAE7ED4527FB9066FB6827
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x8FE57E34575E776D640108D5A98844AF
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0x8CF87EEE21F1F526E79AC57C5A7CB6D3
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0xDC60FD2D2B69ABB50B35CF365037D52B
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x34081A42BA63C3D91295B0EC4B920AA6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x9F5CE2B6680A288F5ADA67B900463253
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x0FA055F8395055FEB5453004D49BF1D3
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x7A8A562219573F3E61AD4C41710E12D1
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0xCB821D3057E3779CE2F5CAB3C88E11D9
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0xDACA0B8E9BB164086ED1ACC8B81A03E1
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0x64621D590E505BBF551CAF79D3C3704F
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0x6DDFA9CDC9E78AB6EC29B7136AE6312D
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xD1B00F87921E43EB1F153B014FFCF52D
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x566BB322C68B7F5050968D75CD894034
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0x5E5C43BC33BB7697E21D7C235EB79B08
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0x47D68449151858E8E9D0BA7E681DEBDE
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x0DDDA32547945E59D8F8A70C3AABF6CE
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0xB514F4A778FEC1BAA532A15A37D549B8
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0xB4967D1B5C7AC3F87DD1FDC64F11F78F
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0x71F04A2C87571DC02FD34FBC3A4E94C0
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0xC3CAC037563D46FB0F2C85E584FE5FFB
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0xB708DF6CB9EE199E64AEE32C9DCD3FEE
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x7722DCBAB0432CA65413978AF56121B7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x45BFCF11A1CAFAAE17322A0B19EF9461
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x8CCA543D370BCAB9D99E5ACC43049301
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0xA50C4ECBE1FB69794FE5ABC46CE132ED
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0xB0D93315A1CB29595E7ABB6833169640
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x8BEDBD17897DD9902001A57A7F1C54B1
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x4261E404195638115B9BDE1AB8E08246
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x73EBD436FAA5250B47E62EEFC3A6953B
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0x0FCBB98D3DB486ED5DEE16CC8AD964CA
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xCEBFC034D4F72A6C3F3F1E90DC85E329
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x64BC2879399B23B08A40E45C1D387533
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x410B140AC80D328B1A8DA8CF6893823B
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0x3B2EB01525EA7D6E59E8A55DF94C22C3
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0xF74C6A25635FBD2CD0DFF8891CB1971F
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x486356E34299EA1F4FD4555C1662A961
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x08A0A729E2D0427FB8A5A6CBB446E464
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0xDEC179B861E90AD231BDC53E1734BF7E
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x1F3A899077ECA6EAC1C29A8939B7EE1B
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0xB10B03BD905D3351E8F7B39D8FEF8A3C
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0xEDE90F13C6FA02E9741FEF0AA4739C80
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0xF705DF1177EC96B7EB5D00FF6FB30685

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0xFD5B17754F5DC82BD95AEB37DBD65F4B
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0x0935E7C80AA323AFB9711C9D6C8E56D4
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x553DDCEC449C96D08993E662D5F0AE34
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x8335BA77BBB6B5BAB988EEE696E3626E
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0x7CE7CE7F5921F9A5DCF3D22B5CF4C109
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0xB3C8ECF0510EBE938695099B7B464D91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0xE1769A2429EC43FF2DA1F2E98241D1F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0xEF6AFF2CB3960CFE3E596371F12012DE
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x94688B900BF108FD7F6C9D313DC2D806
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0x949D8E0FAAE3502CE5E0F810962A4E46
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x9F1C350E9C657D43083B50E08F98B572
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x3AA6B4F4C819D4A0A2A1912D172DE1B8
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0x782272CBDDDB773D446EBE8F3F6E49B5
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x8AF526A259F210B12A95A3DD28633BBA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0x36676D167B94F45F094F959393A33ED6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x2D05D85D6CE0F492B6527E2D0A2AA34D
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0xEE76732686665A2FF801B0A6047F47A0
the money she gets."
0xA7307D93F5A696C137D7907D7ACC2EF0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0xB2C21B48AF78366D6AE9CA51975B1799

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0xC0FBE781732552CD00B1AA16B01743FD
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xEE3B6A5D6E66A9F7978FBDA5E03DB613

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0x4D9A0343E05907F895E8A7351067A389

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0xCE8822763D5FCD5CADB5F8B93C586C10
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x4E230A9C2EAADF74116C8F77D505E108
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0xE19EC2ECADB5F2F231E440CA2E9C2696
excluded.
0x4F6A297BFC9D2E8EE7B3CE04AD4F06F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xDD486E12C16E99AD2310F71F91F11868
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0x05EC3F0B96BDC70EF78BFD5948D28B23
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0x36D2FB4777245CF6AF51704995D59CEB
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x2948989CED5EEA811C815D3CDB8DFE59
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0x3AF8045D2FA0825AE73976F800C16264
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0x4695A82D5780847EF464F96CA02C6195
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0xFB1099FBEFABEA3D69B64BD82828CB6D
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xB0D2B33F2EE1DFD0BAAECFE0F52CE553
sides.
0x3DFC2D363DFC2D368098E8036F2F5157

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0xF5D1103CA1046EE0AA0BC85A79996CD5
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0x4F1EF197014964DDC0F7EC0F56F09DBE
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x6CB2204F9AD37D4EFD82895C9F7E984B
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0xD8E95C63FB46C0BC66A00152803F2DF3
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0x468FEB09BFD86FB347667853FBC08777
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x4EF76B66B69E8E12BC6CACF7DDD6C484
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0xD4121DC2E6DC5809A69073BA9598E518
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x5E2EEC39D7626F2E6C274B834CA511AC
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0xC960E10C7B1349816DD994FBDAD42717

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x425945C052D924C3AEA7D7726FBFD078
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0xCCBFA3D04B9508824AEDE9603B7AA76D
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0x797ECF818569DAF8B708BFC4F430B9C2
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0x4AA4683491A432A11F7F886D034B8FAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0x16C969C32A4B4C295F11A3B26A47E29D
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0xC0D4D54791742DF13DAAEB9BECF04B87
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0x0AF462CEEA03569DF979E3A336C6A311
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x1DFFB0A4DA3BAE3158D3D95156F6E656
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x91DFE1700D3ADB52A7C1D4B9EC0BECD8
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0x59509CD9F9E1F0F3A65BE3510FDFA6EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0xEF3E98D3C7B567FE7ADDBADBDD284D23
minutes."
0x3EC7AA8265C606C07195D750E676C416

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0x6D048092527A6AFEAB3DD3FC9050958E
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x236C5C88694684A7891CFB99BD4A1639

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0x2361D57B6344707379F22AA2F4AEBE4F
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0xE16B501FD6F76B515A5549448DFCFE5F
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x335D70FB0BDCEB066062EE0D0841B087
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xB440ADE761B6ADB799EEEF9F8B1F8A99
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0x082B2E0256F819473F7A7EC12B4D156A
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0x7536367994EEDB8D2A234FC1BDCAFF40
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0xDA15E2229861A6DCB58DBDDF040F0B8C
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x0D520F9F974D12A6C61303D809A03A52
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0x50051BB558572C7574827635A49C38F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0x6AC3AC903404B060B798EB6CF32EC616
below.
0x4788FE1D4788FE1D261E37E12E347D99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0xB3E394DC397075C45ECE455BA974165C
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x93033644FCA8FF694A64FA4C711B09C6
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x621CB448BA422A1B3A6824D7EF10B427
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x0E884941DB5A445DED3DDF3011ED5598
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x2013E464E0CCE1CC36B01C5411B3D371
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0xCC355310ACB0C7951AA35C5DF2EFA5DA
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0x4CF2164B74EA6B00C349AF807ECC6264

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0x78252E321FA3CC65A2D7B95B5D641976
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x5CBCF9DFB3ED9B6664E75A6E343BC532
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0x0ABBD3A3B3A2A3E8836FA961487EF55C
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0x9E72FC10109FD107F15356834F1C7A91
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x5E7C211EDE4D30232BC4ED48540AB023
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x2030753B0FB9B483E3A6D4360708C4F9
and, for a time, a hush.
0xF664536196E9D6E1DE66B713373E5DA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x48C9E473977F3A298EAB9AA033953258
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x4859A3762AA4160D6FCA44B792088332

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xEE67F37404FD18E01DCB66A80F778779
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0x11CE2AFC51A36E0CF7660013169F1E6A
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xE3AD7B89E39BB2CE7099F8B1EB5D9BF7
on apprend."
0x1ED14E99E1DC74FB823EA5E3A2A80CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xF09CD89787B2AF00C402DD7A3FC30C79

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0x83C76CBC81B548DEB87174D847636979
mange."
0x4ACE1FCB4ACE1FCB899A54B430F2A12F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xB58DD41D945AD5196F34F4ED33F1A7AF
get you something to eat."
0xD54297C842FC1334E25BCA6CE3FE7810

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0xB4FEB81DD478609634FF2CD83C7F0ACB
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xED764B1C955073CAA56E4FB76A8AFCBE
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0x14491E158D3429F7D14FE9EE0B1A4036
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xE5806645794541039A08FF9C7CAA8D8A
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0xF0CDD0424C0E2E4D2DC0DF60E7EB90CE
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x6D297212443C5666746A0C8A9B11EFCB
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0xC8C40DC46EBD3E0E78A185F77313A376
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0xAB3A418291ECB83981FFED70E7201927
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x642873784B0ED2E3BAAA465A7D97142A
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0xCDBEA48D6BAF00B3193FD6EDCC6F5AD1
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0xB65E72FAC42E812BF46DBEEBB851AEC0
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x531D459F0F5DAC1F6FB2B17581C48A25
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xF4A2EE2C8F53D9613DB1DF15D951A4C2
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0x095595A0E3D691C7934858D752D8D004
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x1B6E6BA66C7C3F1263376618BD002BE3
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0x0EC3EBBF058CB270AEE95ED839458EB8
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x97DA2803955325B0C41A1DD11DF74C27

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x051896A779C61C25AFF3B0D7563051F2
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0xED7FDF952A0D89E0EB49AB4B632D9960
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0x4F5A3923B0FFE6FB5FB74B461FB1D8E3
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x65FF3FA79FCD1F3856AB3E1F2BCBE0F4
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x7F9F2B2A6C09C8354F123B6E00F57069
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x7D906FDA5E4742A32B8B6A82101FB395
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x1313E3B4E9911D994DBD31E7084F068C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0x95B0BA7264DDA260B3F0060CC1AABDD2
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x91742999ABB9C42D22A3F306C48D1FD8
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x1359A085E7159180FC1EBDA8E69D8D18
dinner?"
0x4AD1CC70DABB99D0884A089D75B4AC33

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0x5C1724ADD9D1B4FE62AA3C9F62B9B7EC
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x4EAFDB297481F3875CF20C26B460F43C
is your dinner."
0x45E7D43C8D78700D5A878F2302E45E2F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0xA4D564A4465602C42D44D0C51515F121
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x4E9F855DD0EAEB574CA6E61E0C2909DF
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x3C4913120D33410C8B0F479ED537FEC0
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0xFED8A072BF8BAD5773D893A700CD4C68
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x8832DB38F57DA3C2A9CADD878801127E
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x4308D619BFE92EAB3F2A9C9707776D7A
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x2C2B5A15C2F7EF777204AE429431C772
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0x99472BC73F635D54AB0F5CC04236C28C
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xAAC3D21289BB68DE2A91C7EB84C82868
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xA428F6FE7725A21C7B139060774F1187
quel dommage!"
0xDD4E40C673A622E25033A5149636EF1E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0xF4F65D4920B6A272B972FFA45EA2C654
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0xA083252848807F0F528FC0272744F95D
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x73CA8857C26A8B755D62A494659970F1
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0x06AA353F02C65D5EF3C68BB0A0021E67
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0xA64B514F0228BBC637164CC288B3C8C8
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x9BF7F5CD29E2DA1ED2FF2017192CFEB2
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0xD3D075D9D60782251C59B984E7C5FD32
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0xE9D5F630F4705382876E82723CA1709E
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x8341851761BBBAA3EE170E844652464B
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0xD3090302050BABC99F2ADFA080D89847
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0xEB2285BC09E30909F439BC3BF790CE3C
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0xAF9BCF8D0A790DABB1B4FBE90AACA00F
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0x695D4D476E123773330FAF5F16867B62
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0x9FE4B6DC9378D79C320E9F194E471AB6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0x07256E5E29362F69353B7F1942A341D1
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0xF508A07D06A33C6999B1DC2BBE3CC180
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x56087358C61ADE71D6266BA5786CD1CA
sought their chambers.
0xEF4113D74702346E0108F1707B0EF3B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0x6073FF1B3943397C8926CE4466D06C0F
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0x76391DF2DAF874E26301A3D19D56084F
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0xD3A346A167CAC8F5B17C01DE11489559
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x6E1AE8B3525CF9CEB2FF23C7D67E33B3
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0xE49529C92676176FED5EA20B7A7B5FE7
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0xF00980C480355AC2D11FA10E558E00F9
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0x3060C15185B0232286B6DF7D24B58BA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x7E385F1711B7F9F46D71D4999DFCEB50
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0xB89F2E5AF4D395E5FE5AA58A4889459E
ladies."
0xC8B493DA19B1C568BCAC2FE68EB21967

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x690F98FE2DAD7EC28888DB013DF7C13B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0x5E8285A36906DCE0BD6AD69000BAA7CE
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0x36029E72E3364DD2450C96BC22CEEF35
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0xB2AF113B2A9ECDC88D7EC44694DE27A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x8D6A7FB36018B78BF366A48E5DBF3E44
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0xEBD9BAA8A9A28D9529C43F590D3747D6
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0xEF646B0ACB6AAD58B2122523B83F0523
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xF05FB9F085F23DEDF17DDD2BFBA3D8D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0x369FA499E8D9CCFF3C9CDEE60FDB3ABB
answered.
0xCFC8F305942BA90D0C1C160BB028D3F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x0C17AFDFAE7E1CCE67159E821034C3B4
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x1DC59B93AE06D09CE07D326F84B79D06
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0xB833605B259A3A66EACFE819C2ACBB75
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0xF92305A8307C581C6208C6F94AD72D3C
case of contumacy.'"
0xF1F18FFF44860BF0B123DFDA67CE9552

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x431F54F9297AFE3110209596AE429210
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0xBD18CDD67F1DD83564FDD72A24FAC6F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0x5E797BC9018D769A216A1FE89EF99334
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0xB1D28E55E425E157330B9D9D4B24A26D
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xB0C359437B9BEAA9C08363ACC8C5EFD1
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0xB933CBA07A669543C2AFEF69E40BEA85
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xB4479A39D6825B6D85B6FE8AD33B3FF8
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x2E2194CF67172ACF0B02AB213184177C
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0xDC91FD430747213D190F790CB194A836

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0x8E371D573ECA98FF8E8EB4D177602941

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xFFEFA2C1E539A3CEE020BC1DAF4BA009
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0xF787F7BE664BDA21060F38C7A506FE75
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x8B34E20BFEE8DC5278DD3FAD4FFD0EE5
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x16B1E4E981B103D4F9F60329F16AA200
stay at Thornfield."
0xAB483F2B4662579E0484101C2DC8CA33

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0x5247F2DB3B5D3C5AC911FB77FD1FB0E1
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x09ED45870378A2443A27E86840B251EE
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xF30174BF97E3DC75BD645A20234EC124
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x36197FD373E619ED49F3BACB557F11C7
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0xECD3F88B33A618E656A04CC0708680BC
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0x2C8236F9F0273E3F8AB743C0FEB97973
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0x30F272DD85321D3E1811E4D554834074
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x8F33542555555B2B8446BF182843B61B
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xB96017A7FA6E99D08E0F40DC55AD3CA0
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0x19A375E3A9849FCF9B8A6609E9FE1C1A
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x7C6D9148D0E8DEE638BDDEB7C7B6B784
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0x8A2FC0E175BE7374DC711B4D2187FC00
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x70CC8FCB9BEFC39065C58ACA08B000FE
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0x1502F0F24011C8F21FC83B958F3FC14A
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x111826E496023C81845A90B309BDDB0E
descended.
0xBB464313490CB89C7E9248D7D6A03A28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x722E9441B3913126F3D1EC09A929A8B1
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0xA797318C975B11E12ED5D15700B1DD63
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x6DD8B5335F96BC5965A079C46B029896
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0x3801555BDED955CDFAD4C6259AA9DC39
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0xDBD89EDFFFD171CD895109ED436A17E3
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x8C94A36B5ABA48F2D6569909950F0B91
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x9CE6ADCEEBC565D37E5B1977F1FBAF66
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0xFE9F318D07685596EB12BC1D72F6AD1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0x48D5FB43CD17BC48BD0010ED71B18B63
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0x884EB10C7A2EC880E6D25416CAEE19B6
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x104628F50D40386CE29F6BBA78D7F3A1
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0xAB6BFA937A89D0C806E8655CC26F2406
touched my knee.
0x40683B09D9AB489CC6F853C8DAB76C5B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is it, Adele?"
0xDD82507C5972FCEE2EEE83C89722AD34

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x861EBDB36201D2B4339DBC9C145BADFB
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0x62D09737FD75C6619FD94CAFBC858290

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0x816AA9A98AAA842EDD8620CCA01E64AF
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0xD53B0EB34725C69A38D89DDBDF06516D
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0xFB09F718EB27145D654801042B02E911
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x01A59EFB9A2AC0FD0F351C111E63576A
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0x69DBF9ADC56819192741C1F8CE1709F7
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x54494E48FACE7366F5EAEB6026DF8740

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xE39D61FFEF1B256C57FB05822BBAD806
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0x5E573EEF01343683CCC853C0937E986F
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0x6B31E24B58CABFB366E67556B886E935
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x6C694DD1E4F96D9324F31C332404D835
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x4630B21091C412B5D035BD8D5D26CB46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0x46C08AD4552F6162A360A55C02E1C3E4
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0xAEAC575C4FEFA141FB10BA6012B4F15F
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0x847C52B53BE0433DD17E0CCCBE545479
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0x77176EA76DC11BA13A129D83B7C2B18D
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x5BBF3533C895355CB36C5E26C9CBDAF5
stared at me.
0xF0900FFBE83CEC9D2B3F28AFEF08A110

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0x37E6CA859DE46A96F32E382D078FA448
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xAC510D780C5EF94311696609C113FDC4
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x7E579CEEBAD185A7E634991BB773DD6D
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0xEDBF454342E41EC426C77651C1A657C1
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0xBFFE62E97F899823E512D9DF368BEC7E
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0x6A332B5FCC33D7CA88C7BCB084F54BEB
and may as well mention them now.
0x53C532A9D310116A42A2ABA138642BE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xD7D9C5F0078A0F156072AA3DB238B912
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0x391CC45058E18D0395BAE48512F9B5ED
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0x98F1D02CCF495FA41B411359D578C942
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x17CDD6395FE5FCE57EDBF6B8F367F806
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0xCA5A2EB74F8087D25ADF1FBA87ACB0C0
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x93EA7EED408A657944140EE9382516F4
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0xD9374C0A15A1993748CF69DDD691429F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0xFEDB419F091BC2B8990956292258A42A
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0xF8FE26DCD0E5242EC1C2E5BFE9BD1A75
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x57B0AB688ABC6D55E74E5C2118922440
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0xD551B5404A182911CC508352B2FAB9FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0x2967F5F3103A6474F408202E3B5530AF
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x38C2B8E6BC0157672B24F3FE02E84E7C
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x10AE9CBE4F0D2775C02C1628F8307D48
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0xC1AC99248271F65CFF25A29808404BC5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x78280D86699C5745C74FEFE9AF1DCD22
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0xE6F4D1427B2B71568F4DF1BBCD44B7C0
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0x8EF5721611D6C02D1896296EDB2437A0
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x93853D264A44136579F89A239A706A25
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x851DCF4382AD04329CF766C0C6084354
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x4E58715DCBC5907CB9404439190C1BDB
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0x9FB4345D9E64A0254B522ECF4BCEEBDB
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0xFDEA87A27D23981FA82B8B233E1D0D8C
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x153F8BD773FD41EB52617CCE6ABCF17A
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0xDB2507E6F69F94012AE42F7714658986
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x5327B344B1B620641AA489AFD837CC1D
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xD15CDBB0E3263A4FD50011CD488FC65A
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0xD37A9E25358D7ACDF8903D9B1B01FC68
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x55E9EEE67350891130E6B9B2BBEF4C8B
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0xEFB14B693F35917B3CE6EF0A4B9E6789
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x4B645DBF68597D17DF335D704D349B22
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0x870D74E0685F194483E2EFB7BF376F7F
truly imperial dignity.
0x8DE8957F9DB6F5C35883C3715518E8E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0x8B10DF81D55C0692D59CD62CF71C03D2
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0x7C19DB87A7CE23E9AC91D978B28326AC
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x7EBF1B6FD508DF46C5DD90D40B08E6C2
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0x9A93A80EF51D9B8E7980D50CF01D953A
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0xE08C4F0F0A1BE5254937A3A452290709
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x0029C51713F7A9D5F659B42E5067F09B
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0xB7F2B9EFD63797A08CB5B306AFAFA232

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0xC5B404EAB181C02E2E292C551C68B703
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x3C4D48221E434D124D86D67FA353BC91
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0xB639CC4A40D633D80351491876A37465
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0x76F4ECCF07EDE0FD40F48E5AACCA9DB9
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0x98E1F5B1611704C5AE3427800AC3A3AF
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x44EA82D8FB3DC68B9CE7E7767F5019DB
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x132CEE67BBC245AD8DA81BFE6BB8CC20
haughty lip.
0x86825599A5406BDD40ABAC13440B0A96

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x91A8A1E12324C4B2BFC8643D5D81228E
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0xF4B74694119414D1B267D24472338A11
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0x8AD8781F076FF0A9CBFE7D7B0119124F
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0xCBC168270E8DFB9BF7C5D63F4F540EAC
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0xCFEEA99DBB5DBBC43D3F053016FC0928
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0xF451F1FE4EDDAC711289A8D288B88C81
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0xABC7D72B02BD38DC100378195A471AEA
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x9C81B608CF99A02A485D1C8426E75913
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0xBDC988D4361E58303F7D991DB8911791
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0x3D57EBE5481F726A749C4C05FDC37981
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x51E574F2E2A19F9994159365D7529B41

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0xE3B7561809AF510FD090D357140AE384
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x37212A7C86F17037632C0246CE91A2F4
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0xB4888C2F0E21287DE90BEC163A66732E
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0x7426EF04F986027DB808DFCEDBA05817
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0x70A4FEE084CFC005D7F52DCDD6D91C12
in spotless white.
0x560E09B6561D426CD33B3A7CB7A331C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xB17CCC2BFA03239B0E38F9298148816C
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0x32D0EDB63E0F8498D111FCA0AD25D300
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0xBE968FD0960B847268CAB7C412D487AC
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x6948CFA701EE5AD5F2D8A248111EF1E0
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0x1FE662E51DD47A954F352E73D07DA0E2
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x2272B45DE841BDB1D30E525DD09EC4C6
together.
0xCB90AB4984A2AA63194A2F3F7F67B85A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x8EE416A7545193E917B7686059C4F21E
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x2900BC8CCF3A230DC3F69E711F0EE694
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x6D70A9170CF3B884F9DCCFBDD209D591
gravity--
0x0B3985310F1534A7C2424D76F7A16DA2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xC9B2ED994244DA9AC28B417317DEE26E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0xE752A8E61B281CE19DB8E88A02575383
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0x434FC774F5E3CC356529E0DFFFB45A40

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x770FC5E9B0A3A6DFBC08CB27A256A366
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x4663F2B72DC3543A65FE2E3E6193499A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x0EC4FAF5628E5744259626F1E2D06083

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0x85E19AF8A20F76083BA517E05BAF33A7
child!"
0x9D89749C9D89749C6C14000291555723

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0x743F95B17D60B1748F7941771D871738
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x9406BA78424EAA5CFCDE4A305927E474
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0x2D5BC67FB618EDC953171C605B4484D8
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x2B55DF1A946789E281A77D99E659913A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0xD938FB9C2855045349AE068E4F19F2CF
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0xDD9ECA594CB5A6FECFB11183FBF9EE98
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0xD87DE273B0EE7B5AB3D1EB4DD76EF7E3
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xF0BF0E3FC8B63F907E97A1162DDA42CC
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x1ACF090D07B391E445CB4302C8B8DF76
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x93B47D5678C677D66C794FC819A1AF20
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0x9B3FE8151D58F78F648F54AF37022C83
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x3FD274B0DA271FD4A1446B9F68E75EB1
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x5664ACF71098B6730B7A54D8071A8036
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x6FB589867231ACEA067564E54F8713C5
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0xB9CEF17D825E76EFA6ED3E814082016A
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0xFBBC815CCDE275A9D247F55B871A991C
blood or vigour of brain.
0x7F70CDA40633690DAE5661B69B77C299

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x7993B8A4CBC963E4240851B02E58CE15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0xBE73B96607A51502E9750F0FB330DEF1
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0x645B62889349ED7FF723569D40B8C914
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x44917B7AB4FC9F2F39BF3B599D95FBF0
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0x621D1EE128DF82A519F7FCD0CCC61D03
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0xDCEE2DFF3637353CFD0B963EC589E2F7
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x83AC3153FA1D6FF9C848A8F47DA79BE0
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x5712B0107A9E6F8B2B51AF16C716AB07
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0x3F3A26C0AE6F5F4F892BDA5B70B72DD4
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x8454AA53491EF217741FB7C35384C69D
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xDDC1998A07D2A520508FC20435FB2167
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0xEB4B6133BD3C85C271880D0C58E29E42
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0xAB6483BE62ED2F2CD26FF11A759F9D4D
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0xF0952FC80BEB2BBDA1082865396CBF07
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0xAAC8A9B1B90F4478E176AC63BDEFD4B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0xF7B98C10379889A095CFAE65681E0519
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x8E5893C87B1BEB9A77A1DBA2559FCFA5
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x48D6DC569C08C4F3F877C0243E8380DC
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0x98DC476564846751124EC59AE87656D1
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0xF722C9A977C4DC57DCADCA8E072A8012
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0x13CFD6B3952F24EE39B44246AF451630
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0x09ACBAE53E54A78594402DB53CA10BEC
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0xF387DD8C7E87CC6E7D26895E98C3A19E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0xE51131769E39C3F82238CFBCC85F5145
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x2FC4939925406152F3EC8ED9D899BD32
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0x4404D19EC3DC9579EFBDBF66482F3A2B
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0xD17309561F5B719E59F18E7A6FF054B0
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0x76931568C116F97BEF4FC300C712AD1D
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0x1DC7908E632256D5D2CEFB7477250E1B
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0xD2B6AF491F4833A41FD37416F35736FC
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0xD1D40ADA76AC145ECD34BA814B2E8E73
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x4C8A4927A8F1C912F1D24E6AB99458D3
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0x1B2E3533954D50C989651444488E34B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0x102EDC195E6DDF95D7FB83114D3165A2
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0xEF0E421E4C60B6E0D1C75EAE180D637B
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0x6BEB9B840467337506DA81FBBADCF1DF
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x16B8056192939D1BB980717245FA09EA
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0x048E97CB1400581B2737C358D998209C
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xBC2CF029B06F12CABB1A963B18AB339D
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0xBD6B7D653FBE7EEA7B16D9A1E80000D3
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xDA1C6AEC51819043780BF76493571FA9
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0xCB1B1E827B491054F760CEBC36B6175B
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x15C49BBCEB5436212C906DB78A003930
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x370B3C11E703525B08BA2C7A6847F9FB
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0xBEACBE3C73832E3E435364A7D3A3C9B7
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0xE10736006039EF434C8AA7494F7E9B17
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x72DD378A666F2CAB1C49477779632A9D
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x62D606F46A80AB08275379DCE9C29E06
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0xFF7CF7DC0E85E3F204BC6E51917AD592
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xCC818D81EC77FEA06FC9C330DA6B520E
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xF5DC0DFBADDDFD6C2F9376FE94810205
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x31B36C013172A230BF14F491B3AAD4F7
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x2EDFF6DC49B905852A89028D50DFE5B5
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0xE8851D58075F3E17D2D24AC577F2ABE9
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0x32888DF77BBF22D9DED53CCFA806E627
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x2F992B86FA73115E4030CB9EEE2AFFB2
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0xEE3D7C994B8E5A7814DC7D47D6B7ECBD
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0x8C21B54B6FC85F1B00D4B6C0DC10715E
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0xAFCE5AA8F6DCCDCDC236FA9C43DE95EF
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x7B54CC749EB118A3EC3138F85CC3D333
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0xA05A1542AD52924459D2D06713AB39CB
breathe and think, I must love him."
0xFF40EB8B00F31B464E58511BE863289E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x696848F2FC7CE20A4697FDF4586542DA
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0xC691F7B731CEEDFA91C3AE7C02F841CE
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x63CE8706A7324FAD8E310EC5DA13079E
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x04C647FAF8E675C5F64F4744892586F5
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0xE597AB4D30B6F53AB69AFCCB6B04088A
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x40C7750D236967FAB1751C8C4881CB72
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
0xA8B72340EA5E17314769850794A4C15E
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x0936F8CEE64D60D6A1118AEAD901A7CC
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x2CFFB4DF2F3994225BC3FE9400A337EB
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0xAC267163AB3FCD038361D96BB61F97FE
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0xD3231DA9FBE8B8785AED4C61B10B9D80
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
0xE81F2AAA8BB5AAAAE6C16C71043E60E8
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0x93BF1D88A4A9F13E6BBC49A0E0BAA430
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x6569AD02CA2A7BAEB3C969663D30026A
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0x99C4C4660D30F1554E8A2F5741E4118A
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0x42D0ED7824CB65D439BFE35EDEE34FF7
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0x9C6972B71E26B2112927B940FD86D8EA
selects a mate.
0x544ACD90A7D70E098A6B5882FA3818D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0x0C4D665EC79A40173C17631581FCEBBF
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
0x3C10023637231D89AD0E44975C7A2D26
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
0xD0E9E9F27508DA25276C8CA6502905EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
0xE102DEA2A37C6DCFD7D5508F78D59DD8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nor am I."
0x99C95EE219355AA0A533BD81602D649B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0x42BA048932FA69B1C7CF00980397EF80
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
0x41FF500AD2E103EC018816CE8D8E88EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
0x7EC9FB3DC0E31EE82F39CFB593C4706F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You should have sent her to school."
0x993AF57AD0782E0125A2F5EDC0F05B7E

"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0x0DFB1420B28072D4CF1E60E68B5F7A18
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0xAC42E982C71DEBD61300962950F2260E
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x997F67524BB3560736CC855F311AC7E3
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
0x1A7408D01439E073ECC18F32A643D6CB
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the

shade: but he never turned his eyes.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
0xC5231BAD21F2EEF1D3FF6EBD7089D19A
straight before him.

"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
0x7879BD03994721E9B82B6F317380BFD8
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0xA01884F866B460AD4652C09A25761C09
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0xDDEB4D963EB10070C8DC7849880C4839
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"

her question with an explanation.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I

have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xF6EA3D18B9100A03DBE77A2930FCC1B9
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
0xADF09B15DF00842C2170D95A5B7554D2
the anathematised race was present.

"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a

lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a

judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0xDD4CC27ACD16E66A15896E63786D43F7
three times with portentous significancy.

"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the

whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x741D9F04DD155BC4319F80D562773E70
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x6644344B007305EA2FF3488355F8DB05
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0x9D5E5C66182DF99C9858D70B36B44745
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0x28733BFA299A5D5EE17ED6182EFFB396
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0xA4D0B0B811EFCB3FDA72F0D11FD75F5F
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0xC2718C77922246E7A5B849F59E8A3D33
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0x6A8793615069CBD0BBC8C0FA5FCE58C8
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0x464F80488EC9A738A7F5E4F805C1B228
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x480273D8C2E5C9BEB474FB6AF4DAD390
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0xDFEEC597EC7585D97E63051A41BC7EB1
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xDBA27472993A451C700D3D57344CE24D
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0x86CC14D51E8E959A24681C7B3BFE94A5
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0x7004F9AB977A1ACC209C97E66D57DB7C
when she was herself so ignorant."

"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or

persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x9C1AA4B8FD336E851329EE6E0074D717
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
0x4910418CDE94980D733E4620D530BECE
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x7059CD36FB5E05D3FE1846F09CF692A9
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0x5CCCE53A9B7ABF7B1076D0C56C0F46B8
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
0xA8168C79679D5DB1F323CA5623EDE570
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
0xA70E8530CFBBAC17F4D95E047F2AB282
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x349357217D00B224B4987F1292DD2E24
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my

"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a

thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never

"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know

them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and

consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance

Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0xB9A0D9BFC0EBD279A8C2C99839F39C36
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0x49AAC9D0799485C2DBFD7820F8F974A4
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her

out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"

she would give us anything we asked for."

"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we

shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in

order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new

in voice to-night?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0xA72AB4EF531B793AE988BEE6BBC7B559
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0xD9CB96D03AAE48C10244CA17E71BC897

0xC403A2E63EECF9A557A300114207D679
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0xB6B79D6BF33222AF6D91B6AB77243F94
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0xC4E5511BCA3CA0AA625E83D0FB935FB3
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my

Mr. Rochester.

"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.

Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x13A4F277B43F1D890592BD2B363F9013
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0xD72871B00E74A412CB11179043976636
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0xAF9F14C3C928EFD45D5BE39E22574D59
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0x1A5CF524A5BECC1A584C431DB51145AB
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0x43982C3F3766C7BC3A958E016728B9BC
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x9A5958A3829379F2C4C983B8740AA8B4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x8118139F6EDAA262740CD5FD636E3386
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0xD50433522453954E5E80FBC6AA6388EC
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0x67C5F558634C3178230837AE219805E2
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0xE1884BBD03204EFF9A5F0E113DCFA494
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0x6642CF0A9DBCC5B98A4F0000C5D1A874
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xD1063D3BA611194D21F0F9E5C6A4322A
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x75310473289A47F44E1FA8603AFEF30C
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
0xB78EE99E83BCF372C933A070E435CB93
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x490818F1F1B38E8030DC4122A8ECE6C4
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x0A25A7339B800954F0C66E59F70BD9AA
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
0x1A3B3925D15DDFD0296BBEDA505AC8B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0xA8F831BF8302574243166DDEC18658D6
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x827B2D898E769C8CD1CF77C7A95FC023
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xD9CFBB5FC469D02042503B992B069E9B
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0x3B1618F7E9094E8B24FE11AC022456D6
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0xC2E0E95788F26C04DE4640B5573BFF60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x667FCA7C3DA5CEDDDF8E115E6489969F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that

reason, sing it _con spirito_."
0xD54B4CABCEE421A6F8E391E1E8B84A30

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and

water."
0xD17526EDD17526ED2D8311434555E9C6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0x104218AB096CD94519F02599F4A4AD9A
such things _should_ be done."
0x5EAAB86EE24052F2F7D8C1FD972E3D04

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to

fail."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0x74B7B4DDE1D7A0330FD399515A8D10EF
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."

"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0x5C7C59D8DF5489899FBE208402CA1C8B
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0xA305BDD20D2770D32BD3F39668E6FF55
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0xDBA37CD7C435FEF6A897F8A5235CDA49
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0x7D29FB9E43EC3929C0C517F8C33C545C
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0x22FAE08B72064D7EC8DAF02BC34C6B28
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0xA41070B36D015554D25D92645D1A37D8
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0x448819DEF179DFC0217F31C06C2DE6A7
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0xACD3B7F6091A949808AAE495BB5ED172
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0xF330D231F5873BD7540F2BDB4DADD217
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0x31FCE31C6D538091A68C9C016750E505
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0x6A2AA0BF1E9664E939A1CCE494B76678
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x06151C96B6041C8A4E9D9BB68845F6ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How do you do?" he asked.
0x59FE38978C39A1DC8BE461146985D5B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am very well, sir."
0xABFFAB12B9C33FD0C7DDAE40A106BF7F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x120C8D8C8F79383E01FB178AE516CEA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0x2596B3FED1713F2A67E3222C52AD9331
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x57737F40F7641F88489DF5026B8B14F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x2043233D28BB3C8D6A5EE5EA5312474A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x4FA61ADF40614152EB3CBE46AAFAC945

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0x8BDF9EBA656955C45EC1D1E9F4B98A7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x767B8CF4743F92E898FFAEFB65FE6818
What is the matter?"
0x8ABD8CD40C238236D676500002988B13

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing at all, sir."
0xF2B17953A62EF3A86B049A55678CC175

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0xFA87E53E699394130DD4940EA007F9B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not the least."
0xB84977BD583A297E2E77F566C924EE69

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0xCFBA18735FF70E39A908697E4C196E60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am tired, sir."
0x3C290EF314C67D639AF795D5682BBC89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked at me for a minute.
0x68EF499D96ED4B668DA8A0BC43F93AFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0xB0FB3736842467C014FD773D48A4A5A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0xE45033A40A29FE8D4FFDC508CDC32F63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0xDDC3345A9D1ED8FE5409848437C65DCC
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0xD6A010376A2EDCDFA60420DA44C86C3D
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x75E762CE2D100135B4E2BBB7F97B8AE4
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x6AFDE8E87941BD5D104A44007B29DAFA
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xECECD5B428EFA490DF5E3B78D3B562B5
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0x76AF1FF44E181A9D4D9E77D29B5F6713
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0xE10E93F7D1E794F033BF1E8955CFF131
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x775C3051C5B3B91DA0D3D13578C833F2
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0x085655E7DD771784630ADE7F6D91711D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0x22991AB5075B906441A4D15DC719A977
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0xB75964DCE888E39DA0DE2655D9317A71
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0x949B6B61C03384C80C6A029FA8A008A0
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x434D11E614DF32D4913465DE7612BD55
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0x7B01AA1BBB0B2DA7E6A957A1BEB82DB2
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x16C211A4E78F73F265274B6547EC1C17
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x77E195AA639DE5FE572A4137ABE82EDF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0x1A099E4B3FC10570F970AE221BD10977
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0x5D6441733702CE26A7D8ED68FAC8CF9F
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0x00CDE73BFE62A6C4A49C296763FEC001
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0x7918B34B7B47B21CAAA9410D9A60E497
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0x6350434AFBA0C607F7A4E34C72B8FA67
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x5582AF43C7762BB081B19604C1DFE048
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0x10F98F6C061370D0B710CC6A5506A124

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0x481128EBE07C89DD6A935E68CB633CBB
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x2A27B56DCF1A6A27D6342A9A17150451
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x76525C1109F10714E9C766DE5EE237BD
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x878B1C45F3413415D31816A22194E17C
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0xDF2E643C698E917ADAACE90C9EFB6159
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0x01BB0390A1C854FCF91DEA41655C414A
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0xF8E74168FDEBFF433CE2EB7DD48B0D61
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x5258B79B4B32EF505FF7E1400AD97A34
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x0099142D3BA4675F6E3AA160A8D5354A
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x46514239976429EA501FDE26EB94FCD8
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x1AC25971285579FD4AC985D70CFE4E17
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0x2BFCE5C02147F10E332C23337F6011DE
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x075E24665DA122B0A93970FDE557C6B2
drawing-room.
0xE73BB85D0AF87A9D9E3A8E939031C5D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x9B16E23985E341E0E2EE025951C28C47
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x3235BBABCDCF44CF5A4D1FDCC134C45D
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x6A517832C2D9341BEC2B989608641374
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x908F39E944638CCAF00F0D5B35A7F553
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x8A1F9ED3A50B5BAE0B4DBE8750776311

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0x61EB315A47DEECFC5F27F4E0FF49AE0F
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xCE46E931C729EDCFCF4FBFE1C150FF82
usual seat.
0xB19BD9D120A3CF5CD071403388753131

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x57FEFA47B266830059C3B231D64AB1A8
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x95E7D81E864620B90349369E7A932B0A
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0xAFB14879D77DB849214BDE6699BF0FF8
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0xDC3C4DFE9A1BD6D0AECB1AD4CE342341

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x15B8EEF628BE89AEE68A678A2F08B694

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0x10C97277ADD8F7EA7B907AD5204E0981
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x82317451AE5ED654B13057B5C0902F38
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0xB578BF8FDC0C6F7A183ED1EB46BA4982
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0xE2E8E8FB45B734F542719C12A6D893A3
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0x1C12D5B9748ED3FDCAEB7D7E765EEE29
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x1A4AA7E401A264226AA3C53705E212E0
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0xDC683B5D7745956188B7FC66A16282D2
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0xC4149B538CFAE450E1B35AE509EB8116
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0xCEDD2C97F89542A59E61E66499F38C97
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0xB7A8DB0F669A15873E687E89B7226FFC
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0xB7550B2EE705D56830CABBEFECA1B363
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x42CA66973761C4A0E891698F2EA27FA2
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0xC6B08A48042374639EFC3949EAA11974
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x257BC9102D26D57FBF3A45F36C4F3AC8
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x50868F22BA80AACBCE038B58C7D6A899

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0x81A296F188447AFC282D41BC3AB779F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0xAEE7EF506E744587CD5825EBCEC3B40A
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x2D6E405FECD8FEF763914CDFE65ACCB8
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x82D392061E60FE4AFC6516157D510A10
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x1477DFC227A632106A12D73C1C095054
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x0B7AFEF2D927E71893C28433D8A053EA
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0xF3F4E7F136F7FBDDC4CD27B6705C7BE6
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0x075AF6A594AFADF955B5C060227BF6E4
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x9E81945C74CBABEC7B1B5F282C91FC49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0xDEEAB3084DC82E84F7B293D80284D717
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0x0F2B3FD4EACBF12EF9028F6A392EFE09
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0x77E57634EE31D9A9727851B60915FBFD
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x609D38ABAA048A36C30EDE493723CA11
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0x504478AD4F27B050ADAF240020FD7377
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0xF27E93A09CB6E38433AFCF951EA38FFE
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x583675FE75391658214AFCA060FC2F46
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0x6890662C8346D2577394FF15EB097121
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0xD538784312EFAB2A448A44E0D1204525
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0x317EF7B44CEE082F7FA39DE1CE146FF3
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x4A2E0F3633EF102C9A60B060CFE33FF1
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x60318D63D3CBA8E22538660BEF520487

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x9B02286AB2FDF2E3D7B8C0F1D5DBBF40
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x032BFC872E080DC968480A52BE0AB71F
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x2A8AB9FB4E999060CC786F0940549C9C
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0x67F3D86551E7B9B76B0D29B3C8A959E0
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x15D34A2342FDA565830EE59D8E71D5EA
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0x368B0B24AD41F2ADE7964BDD8009CBC5
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0x55E8F3C6FE272FA0E4B75F7EA2A407DE
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0xEC46D2D34745A40D40BC90189D2911DB
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x0385328238E214C531BB66B21CBF5B41
wanting.
0x5F5DA0CB9BD303F31CCC8419ED122B69

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0xC9C4BFEA72789428B12B9CCF48F8C712
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x51EE0D2DD2834F8A7C6649941045C944
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0xBC0BF8EEA92BABB1848DFD75767B8EC0
curtain again descended.
0xA63E3F658592A01C252CFD2AC60D0837

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0xDA40C67312279AB823B132EE4DD5C14B
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x997C371D023B1484345FB5272D7C257B
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xA4DD9C1878F90C8F2E30E57E4AB82134
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x140FD235BCF63952518C0A2593A60B2C
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0xF4028126B8FB109DC480684D98192B51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x3704DBDF15E6FF73635B4B395B9BDA16
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0xB049E1334797F4A957685FA4A5661BD1
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xC0AECBEB887EE4713174AF20E40A35AD
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xD392BDAE16150A0E7B86C221B5AA0CC0
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well

have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0xEF98A0DA19E7C71A5DAD03773371776C
attached fetters.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xE1BC721B783FBA789E1B8B4D43DA9445

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0x3BA4732A82C4B0821063A7B1C9482BBC
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x1E004A1C4316A8D67C00C8FF27735AC1
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x641D849B9D330B7490FC7831AD8DFC6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0x2EB6EE33D9DB4E9F097DB72BAAA3C382
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x87DB0F0D45FC2E5E05A1809FDDC02DDF
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x704FAE51929B693BA8CF042A96590366

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x83C9B97FA78EB3F3673B34711F7F3E0A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x86DFCE61B1A4139C8C4A9A91EA3E5799
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0xCF71CF64BD7139160D174C263EF7F69F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0xCEFABFDAE9F664CE198E7A1AA74B89F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0x29EB312C892891EA5649035D8F6F4B0E
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x91BF0AD72712DB1802C8B757C3CDB1B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0x2C059873969D4A1C1E4A9A88B747EBB5
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0x3E78E7FB8A0A431C3C42E66E72673944
colour rose.
0x7A8D58EAC38F4C855F1650E52AB3DAA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0x3AC5A6F0BB918286387F3E1DA8EE4E3C
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x63F6F6046586C992E1A9A2364267D4F6
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0x3BBE15DA4A8B5B8CDFBA2D4B15F5DAB6
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0xD04204840A92E51DC6BD08054AFB00E4
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x1CF0CB651111044025498DC131A95BB8
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0x630223A1632097D2462B3E4BCA301354
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0x0F3DBF8EF8E915C9E778FF24854C3671
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xDC3097184A40964343E889175F661DB1
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0x831EE58969D7D73FA9A0D726F66C18CB
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x15AF2D5AF47199D007EC27BE6171E8CE
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0xDE36ABF69FA1C121224229A0DB8A75CC
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x78F865D09D1900109ED904EFBDED0B44
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0xD0522D83D34CE58A5959A823448D0E76
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x509A043E39828D78F17CEAC84B66290F
returns in memory at this moment.
0xFC4BA6B288AF421BDBF43260572E2652

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0xF01480C71AAB2D15EE97CE2655776CB4
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0xCC4823982C965809619FC9D7A0EE0487
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0xD857C9C892114A39A3E235F863A0A761
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0xB257A68AA1B487B0AA9316CB7186BD5E
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0xF689532D4A3080EF662C59C68EED2145
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x44F93712596255B19199B6D2CB6CE5DD
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x97C0CFE51B360756A1EE16EBB9215FB2
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0x95EF6E002F4D54BCA55586AA2ECE7B56
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0x000D905357C995DB47C1344CD9C0363C
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0xB6BB31B4A56A660077B1E8B34F4D6A28
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x2101A9F0E94672721BFF4773EC1A33B5
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0xABC53950DD2E7311711293BEB24D2A13
very pride, irresistible.
0x264101A72C29BAC95766C7C8B5ACBB52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xF908FB26B1D8599134FD4C0705DDC65C
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0x84E8DC37B6F448468A25F91E47489EFE
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0x62113C73D7E665E4BE85343D8E5B2CB4
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x7B6BD2645732725A3EC43500E305813D
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0x9564DD950C252624A12AF3D786FE84AE
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0xA05BE36485EEDAC696E3547BB0CB9BAD
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0xDB9F272B051440AB5BE58272EE818DFC
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x9E8386BDF239C9FD975591055B341A03
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0x62DE1EDD07D4D2C6781DD73C947D9B06
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0xB39E51B0ECB760E44980E9E8D42D8CD8
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0xCA270C943F82B8A4628EF0F007D6C3EC
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xEEC77B8C5FF2AE4CF63C77B7B31E345D
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0x37CF9DA496F86498BD0AFDEEEA3037EC
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0xE2D850219E755A784F4017DFFAAB3369
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x5EF9AA5C71D06F20FEB1E8041760851C
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xC390CD3ECCD7D4E749A2F447B1BA01BC
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x6AD6514F1BADACF0D1C12CBC84B737B1
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x4197D035FC70B5A3F966A8DE73FCE290
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xD9C3AD479467DFB70D145B7678976AE9
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0xED8DB4AF1C9066F2F707C3F9B0EC07A2
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xD5D022ABEC8BE9584EFEF30320949A8E
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0xBF9637A11BE7F9C24FA70E06DCE52D9B
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0x14A011EE603CA2D90C883C836502048C
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x4F184C047A08ED8F0BDEAD15E7992E33
torturing pain arose.
0x2DBBDB59FDAF10BDF8B0375C2F70C2E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x22F3B2AD81E6642572A71DE19D4F6C78
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0x58017DC6D68A6691A37ED5CCDD7D530D
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0xAE91AFBB6E71D8F8A35FCDC246CD51F8
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0xDE456A1003F51E199E44ED15E8D89EAA
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0x6EFD4DC2DA74F0A39E44B1412429F407
not charm him_.
0x48F6E474E98964FEB4AE491033C82BF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x808138E7C16F2B1AC1978DD3BFB5DB41
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0x8904A0226261279CBD95E9F3FF90E28C
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0xCC4114AE8CC8F638FC42D53FBE22B2A3
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x59961ACDBE6978B9B64ECCFA57852FFA
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0xA68BF374DEDBC0E3C412BDC6B0E95E41
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x735CB73AB76BD546184606C96374C076
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0x558CED8DD17546823EC8172A65205881
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0xAA0A6B6E37AEBA6EAF5E4938CBCE4B06
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x07D447485B6EAB5A5E92029CEF43869F
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0xFA8262A32FC3F8727A18F536352CFB34
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x43FED518C328B6DCCBD9F6A8615071F7
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xE5F079D145A57A31C61DD03FF3D1BD29
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x6666BE9AE1530D439F8B8276FEF22B70
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0xC0DEFE283AFDE3B8781DF53ECCBDA6BE
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x1C21EB7131739765BF175FC0950105AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xFDF80B1D2F12345CAB1FE97071FC4DC3
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0x2C49126A1316DE4326C0B72BAF043E9B
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0xE55396CFA1DF3064DDC3982D7DA22BFF
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0x459639F24E1ECB69F15A28D153690C52
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x71FFB8EB8F06D05C70B8D31FB1E70CAA
silent conquest might have been won.
0xC4EF60C9BE4BACED0BF3F559C0309622

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xC73326100433DB8ED4F58EF18D5C0877
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0x1AB3C9393C288FD7BC1BC874A9C8331C
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0xF8EF9DAFA0133799D4C7D2DF85A32058
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x47AC18DE2C2EA588D7DBECDFA650482B
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0xE8AD55E195AB7E243BDF6D78AE33F06E
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0x5964CCD5A4057A9F0C03ADCB85C54228
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0xF75A2D7D3C3B818D0E1E07F8C8F1A82D
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0xACEC002288697362FC3F2DF68EA6FEE7
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x2A72968E1B8C0E8B5AF615D6D795E9D5
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xECFBC80DEB7A165996CC703BB1AA169E
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x50675609B4F704F6DF42FD6DA9033AB2
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0xA7005DA10FA807765742E0F223DD479F
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xBF992621A3FB2A0C1B58CDDF8D086A92
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x2A9E180694616D6C93E59FC9766E725F
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x072741AF18147F8B63A1F03199AB21E3
shines on."
0x2ACC9D45CA9A24DE3C96D355E007ECA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x221D1C5545D707E60A7250B97A7680E8
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0x413160D7C85C1C8CCC0EAA3F1A94023A
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0x4117958CD67EDD3CEAB91BCB5D2A18A3
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0x9C020B06024A4FBF777596EB05B76115
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x1EBA3E6038B6332B53E81C0843695C5A
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x38E34E0609243CCFC1AD0AA463A7C12A
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x12E2F9043ED39C85DBA9D201778BE6B5
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x4B3E38BDB1E3B6C6B1FEAC96886D3025
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0xBA22F1259278B3D22618152ADAD8F1BD
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x7CFE372EA24CE59EC0E5D932A88E40EE
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0x4FC95CC906BDF505DE9D6B59E0D1986D
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x0FC41EDEA1ABE107646DF194E11802F3
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x6992B1BE33D17191E42C2C19C411EFFE
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x56B16357D4AD3DF2F8AA3E603F94A35B
as I wished to act.
0xB393A1FD275732BFBF9193232FFDB212

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x4D393A89DF5FCFC1E138AB4F1CBD1C12
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0x37AA2D7C00A86CC95F13DA16234C02DC
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x9F70A9666570D1F37C4C97707548D91D
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x8C154FC471E5A71AC0D0505A291D0547
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x06AA0EE1C9518922BB720F6039535840
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0x5437F848F0BC6F2583389848D228D9E6
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0xD4A0788F9E3E7E1CB107FB9B5E2BF23F
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x08F17A578EE00396B2692A25DEC4464D
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0xC285C45977C4ADB547ACFDB48D1CC2B1
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x2A3E0E2EA3319BAFD276C23831702E0A
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0x8112BAAA7DD623951D2FBD16B4DABF17
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x2F78FE91BD6C26911E7FCE70D6A49B70
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x2ADD325D133AC95D45110E81E7D05A3A
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0xEE7004B33E971E3648019631FA9EA80B
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x464DA3E387B2A4735559D2B0CE5F7443
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x9AD168212588E747AD3DEBD2AA6B5B74
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0xADCF59D0C66704DD8C8949AEE3A5AEFE
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0xB7463F6D4F07F2F10A1F8B1D26141FB5
nature.
0x4487EB0F4487EB0FA39584EA92172227

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0x656B1928CF7D7DE42F4131BB0CB926C5
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0x42A964269A950803833D67EE8B996936
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0xDEDD78A6A512715E935DBC4E277978A1
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0xD1210045463CE0B768DE99B25BCCE73C
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0x5DFC42E4684229C1052C84A79A0E030F
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0xE4552529D950B4E791F992AE62384DED
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0x3200A34EB2086C675F2364F088C0DB13
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0xB0CE1CD31DD1B631D38F0D8C609B49E4
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0xAC465934C0CFE39F61D62DAF491365FB
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0x5449EE557829EDE81AAD37FCAEBE5497
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0xC930EC778C81EE65043D46AD5587A058
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x971B48346706357E12CE67E3CA72A0F5
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0x58D1E52657A1BF332A9738E242143236
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xC9ADCAE4E64C43EB28637D1B9E5957C2
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x6651E5F3C07F296FBB0BCEBB8422FD10
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0x192769BFB7FA1369237CC70E00C8BBCD
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x5FAF7A3740C3038AD0CED7F2CC20CE57
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x5A40C5BB0E764947D1D8FC8EECADD8CE
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x026046F485F5809B4FDA678C9AD24D01
vivacity of conversation.
0x25A2332D564A7C167D2BB4B26D7932A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x07AF4210F9E2AA2E4521EEA7D903CCA9
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0x6624A3211F4A660EB444C67F15E8C362
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0xE2A7B8E092C937EB0B86A3192A6D7DD7
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0xE8E9EF7A94FB42554648B316F056F9DD
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0x72BEC13B8B855E7DD7363661D9027FC6
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0x355B7EC634EF24BB12E92C18B5EA7105
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0xDD26A5BFC935C9A2B03E789D107F07A3
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xA9129E16E29D66A87E0788F525A6E35D
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0xFEA0D41E7AE5EF893A7D600BC51424F9
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0x941468592041212C06B2CAAF5492570C
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x7A2A89ABFEFD7BB11A907C78F8FBE07A
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x85E90A8C0C56E795D5BDB25E3ED408FE
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0x98F78C9729DCD1369590F729E953F9E6
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0xA2711D29E0F9302E2B10F815ECF9720A
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0x57AA6D6E6ADD832AF8862D91FBE1781A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x8350320C791922513B3C913F029D371F
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xC2824238EAA496F3D2575AE16F6E360F
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0xCBE69D11FBBCEAB422FF3170DDD84970

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0xCC9A400F04133AEABAD9CCA642C65A0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0xE91A5E916F99A45DBA8187DEF60DE3D2
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x9D1A934175C3D6695C5732D711A7616F
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0x1492FDAF32085488693691A0E616CE9B
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0xA459867805FB4CAE040C04651E971D14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x5A6E60FBB733A5DEA0274F238A2D2011
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0xA783DBDF5AC6D72A9E9C1C428D4349AF
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0xE8E9529E6F633B2DF481B65A837FD1B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x70E98235D98FCA926DB9931FA7BD6E87
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0x0B38FEF1C8408646C424837B04CA46EE
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0xAF00903A4CA29140622D80C5E54151B3
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x6C0347FCDD5DE96B2A0C0613FB705EC2
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x4433ED27D8B07EE6503522F0CD48A99C
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xD9780B3656FBB5DBF61BB5100118D088
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0xCE4FFD42A7F3E7D478E61F500536AB31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0x4535FD6F6CED49B2BBE31142A21AA1AD
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x88E100C2C0054AE47DA8F41A57377AB5
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0x19694DDA924F1FBE466A8618A410BDE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xD81E954324815618E212387655F71AE9
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0xE876042A5DBC5BE705F67B8E4538055C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0x35B0D2A1FEF5E04A3573E66ECA52F2DB
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x88CE4F729F2A8FE9DCC9933F45D3830A
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0xB2B4AB74052E46979A5F44B3DC66FE3B
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0x5568C5208916D1592FC2E700DB87F689

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0x9ED3DB28D42937ED01BD3DD9DE8588E0
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0x6DBAE3ECDC5E61968CA0FC7BCFDE2571
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0x12C86AE2756C25CB8D19BE64D3771FCF
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0xFCAFF040652685C377D480031C8FCCC0
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0x10C0AA33FB7D895BE78DA327DBA406C2
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0x3629EBA9FD3161E5B79E5E00739DCA62
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0x9D0BFCB319032FD444FECA0EA368949B
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0x60E524D258CA72BE7D029F350C8607C5
least so I thought.
0xDD713F6DE448AD4EE3963AB936FC9D1F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0x764787448B187CD207F1FD2382823DDA
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xF2FEE8864CD8C81105E9A65A252956F5
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0x7B80694126C959896CC9E2D7B0F8F3A8
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0xC0B5BFD7335574139AB47C2A64C140A0
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xD6D6242036A04D89497AB4B0CEC6182E
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x4A7F0F6953B62F717FC16CC5484AFEB0
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0xAF6B6005D396A4F52AFA5A57E52C8491
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0xEF34E030667073F80CF7414F32DC8AEC
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0x22D5150BD9ADB9DE30E3F2D11DE01B1A
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0x0314BDC8D33B49AEF742AB97AB5C8F11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0x285288E2DFAE7898F294FB67A41B9D52
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x2D60DA9899DE6954BF8AE039B48EB08B
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x279636402C91AF515902DAD7E04CBE47
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0xAB0DD7410D79B8B04F8D1D61755AFE6E
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0xFBC43308ADA0EA30A1D434C2651D59BF
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x05F3DA9A9D1406694292B35AC8977BDE
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x9D67AD38810538B289D6D194028953EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xF5116E05B0587ABC8C1F528D3EEA18E0
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0xCDDB41680BE0E7D9B640ECC6D085F830
that "extremes meet."
0x6EBF2A1F7C8B73EF7B88D4D08FEFF0C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xB3707D019A6162F2E80BA1F58A5F6F95
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x008C3907BBCB0431EE724DB21EEEEB89
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x64816BEA5F383049BCFF97C9C4C14AC4
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0x563A13E7682BE6A61BA6BA3D59A41DB3
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x344DF7025F15475B9C7B3B6CB98B0EDC
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0xC894E44A24E346C33211F81FBB80C874
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x2A081FE581E0F6E13B3C0D6278C2BCC7
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0xD1D8FBE7BC8199C68D8B720E3EBC343F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0xFE8D073D82D9D4DA92906B112127B1D2
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0x3870FA3120133B8C17E3E63EC77B2CA8
a placid eye and smile!"
0x2322ABB5E6EBDB58D8F05335EC3FF202

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0xB398B631885DB3E852876C4017B22465
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0xBE13838244637F4306906720204CCFE3
Hay Common.
0x8E7B4865291A9F1456DF909385C0684A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0x2499B2A4C933E48DFC0226E8F0E690E8
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x585E434949E6344FC8C7CF36E1A962B5
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xD217D04C25A636490F5FBFD90CE5D19F
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0xE8EF4F359A19872C30DDC2F2788002DF
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x55B9FC35292724C7BAE5D6C872AA5C0E
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xF450BA2D0FC59B2F5DC996C2FB1D01EC
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0xA688450E11CD7D212F1F3D550BDCDCA1
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0x0CF72355CE8778A1FEE4B8E0C71E843D
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0xE3F5F92E15418370816056397FA25C72
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0x4CEE2FA305EB7124A1A144F482A25332
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x8E4954E712DD988E832BA649F755EBF1
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xA55838EF3B1087D4FBCF788FA15840B7
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0x275525CC800ED4AE5F9F5C2D78D85499

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0x082BDF1D643B0A62958C85EC403467EB
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0xB738E17148C4C75D413DA35289693E3D
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x68D8399D78F7456FC321FA3716B68650
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xEC0B282D9BB0AFE1F51476C2C7D7BB49
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0xC2502E211FCB6C35AC0CE7230654F352
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x93DE16E4BCFA886314DECC423C285A24
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x169674BCB275B401F69E321EEA841DAC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x6E6D328D7F2CAEFAD3EE0484AEA44EC1
off," replied the magistrate.
0x640C40B07F4BF1F58EF70A5C70312C84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0x9AB8DD80F65AEF531E34FEEAC7137E03
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x3209A9A13C8E4C26A85E2729ABFEAF87
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x41980A1B018176D0C9D5AC04A3873DB8
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0x8199FB6D7E6CA1A1E77B2CBB7B9A70E6
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0xA1FD101BEF58568E63F646A2A3371096
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0xD622BF19C97A2EA2BD8E6A5DCF14B8C5
see her?"
0xD609F3728ABA5EF1CC8C080EB8CF09F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x5C5E1A0DA96490AB4249587AA9AFBC9E
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0xE02952BA230746C374A5893484A5E200

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0x6BB86EE62236786D66256D07952A7EFC
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0x3E5FE46D24386CE4234D42916D0AC9D4
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0xD24E3765520BE43C5A43B1758F9AC8BD
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0x36E2B28E48A69EDE857C9A63A8EEE5F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x533A12E5A2F7E8EB52863E8B3361D8D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x39DF948E485F54804514C9B9875A2D2E
must and will do it."
0x1837E474D717B9DAB2B6436F91E993DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0xBB64DE5A8ECFB217393998CA2346DA4F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0x8DA2DE852D8402339B208B592E65D6D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0xD9E5665F636D647D174F4A179CD08FB8
in, of course."
0xF435957A43393B97694E9511BA367A63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0xD716B8A4E1DD8802372FC090A34F290A
throw away such a chance of fun."
0xBEDC7D7AE9BB1630F17C8521E77F1A8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x4B1CDE989B1CED35B82A8C5E373A7B87

"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x7D3408BA66A431BBCA65F948EA45CC53
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xB5C4B69E106898618A5D366634EEC091

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x33A26DA1492600C2904C4C63859F106F
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x7A33C3C292DEC7CD10933D244E795F36
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x04C3441927A6973582DCE2D90EC6E240
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x9DA79E6F4D5B3CC7490160473BC6A6BD
forward."
0xDA89A1F49D8C685144C14BCD490BF975

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x93BBF443F6FFEE5916BDBF2EFDD8EB1A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0xEFAA5205B4195C047DA7D80904215111
Sam!"
0x8C4ECD468C4ECD46CA056149B685D948

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x9169F2F9ABFCCBEA671B39EBAD1B000C
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x8069ACE901E01FE125C7623382A3C47E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0xFE813935C2C6C29F7395E3680D8E7924

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x2BFBC949F40BDD0DA3F9A043B6621D2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x4C665E15D767E93E920CFF141A724685
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xE26432A47D93C1A2FD5DF5C572DAB9D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0xE3112069E194271E8F2ACE3D6ADE980B
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0xC243320A9540D282613B4880E9BDDBEB
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0x4E94CE9C2EBCF6D9214DD6A2415ED7C3
one."
0xE2DC8A34E2DC8A3494E485CA4E58B7EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0xF8AC65ECEC76197CF9EF58C0F4019B69
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x870DE0E835D2E9109A4EA0A6914637BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0x026490126117BD45291D69866E4EBE08
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0xE0879D6BC7A6034543ADBD48C77C6780
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x0846ECEEBBD8806E4191F1E60B1954F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0x16F6E87066ABC2FD68107BBB44E8D470

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0xE679B13C6D90C221B2193D3F7FE33034

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0xCCECD4058CAD60FD393BE1442E73F190
once more.
0xA883B56E51E3E2C3C01625D13F4E60BD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x091FBD9D0870DF29126DD5B32A13D897
know who will be her first visitor."
0xD9DB185394B33D316F4256D5ED3FB7A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0x41C5E8F0E8F5B67C3A5438882A811A42
said Colonel Dent.
0x66961C91954E0B2145AED07BFB8CF571

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0xC959C7522FDAE655C8E1DEE981673FB3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sam went and returned.
0xD826131FF1FF9412083FBF580E1BCAD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x4C56ACAF983235CEBC37A0B902DFEB69
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0x03A880BE338FEE2585ACEB11EA72B0B7
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x1EF67178E7D5C5CEE9D0881D72D23903

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0x82E09746EE898FFCF31FC5B22872A15A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0xD11943294FFA04E313E60776690A1B89
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0xCBAFC6B07C1DA0090D8F0CDED03D7294
of his men.
0xC7FEB44DB9A9FC66B41E6A9B83589FF0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0x8968F4E2ED93199314D2E0DB9AE412FD
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x6D0C995204FF62B34656D8103F14B150
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0x766EF11CD476FD7A2096EF0C0BDBAB46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xA06EFAA1544EEE426E39654AA23782D5
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x79244C5352345643E8611F813DDA48CB
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0xCDA9F2DA0F09C27543F69EDFB2F6AA00
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0x55615A8A956AD59F19463AC2CBF2E27C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0xB5808087B7DF9B32CA306A489746AFFE
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0xA0E09630C02E58F6C66BFE946FCA8813

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x43AC65AF1A136F716116203E508BCBC9
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xE3290FDDAB94AD7BB6777F7774828E3D
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x59A6251D1FFD62EC086D5C4C5C252FB8
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x557665E5B08D03C4E2F0C164DBECD88A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x7585E3D051B83C678459BFBA4C5F4BDB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0x04BB0794DF07552E67EDC063B10F71A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0x853A87B881ECFD36273CE60AF9FEE293
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0xFBF3E042A9966B69FF21B0F651663194

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0xE1076E64569C637F66A80413F004BD64
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x4D42A543B7E40D57E9145D38F2E4C0AF
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0x0DF3BC5C7CFC1717C5D19FF05755EF5B
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0xA4597BA9D2AA352344F4228D1FD8E1BC
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x17C26357DCDD8324F57F77D900D63B7F
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0xBD2E70D71E73013BF98362CD83CB172F
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0xDFBA0AE8EA33D967E002C0AEDA2763F3
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0x2AA7CC41EC6C1D079FA466CF65C77867
morning, as he threatened."
0xE119EFF7D479F09D32A908550FC4C071

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0xB7F26AD63FC3142E1D0EEDAC9789CC38
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0xF7331E8380544AEFDEBDEC25F798DC3D
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0xDC968B0117D7D1AE0AF8F68264896D89
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0x37C745F69C2D46ED519CD29DE5A511AB
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x5E3B1C5A95E99ADAA81907E9075031F4
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x4D4A192BBE509B9B9C716A76A5532E6C
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x1AA469C03BC38F271354DFE4B3D208EB
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xCE42DCDE0FFEE6FBE54B2DAE8BB4B158

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x7C85E40DFB357C60E1A6C7026FCB1CDA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x17A0EA6CB579F59B75E075816BA57B79
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xA54EDDCEAAF2A439E1B8E6E8AC1F169A
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0x3399DDFEC67170725A62CF5CDDE12338
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x2ACFDDA373AFA08E75C1E7A9D543F797
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0xE4CF0598460D6AB9A794B557DE11D91D
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0x807302E04B6196590D52785D9FA82B36

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0xCE0EA11867E1F54536BC7FF3DB2AA273
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0x34AD424A619383D7C81F138836CB3999
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xE4D736D42F11C6D6C3DBE1E1780CB273
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0xE8C6C0DAEF0564C2842299E16A590D2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0x78E4BBD1C704B7CEE0AFB86F5191F60D
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0xA40E05B477D175EF6B313C7946651529
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0xF61DA694E6CF8F5E2559AD02BB778F80

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0xCA376475DA40DEB57CC663AFC1F5D9EE
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x4C4304E19EC23C65A7CA6486DF763F51
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0x00D92A3A8924D2C8E15B5CCF6130AEB8
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x45FD33AF54E949DE837450C5AAA3CDC4
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x5147273199C3C9777DAD3DFFDD064E06
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x4A94AE53C4B233BE43246BE8EC0780A4
they most wished for.
0x80082DE96DC7AED2C72C7621A67C2F5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0x0EB2D7F216F86E69797675E3B61DD07C
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x53B5007F1A010DAFADB6582B489D81B3
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0xB9025400B921299A76F761BA04FA6C47
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xE8E5F6A7329FEF2CB5C94CFC96B6246A
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0xC762FE2404F5D3B72384A298FFC1F38E
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0x5C7AE032485F5996F64774901D3BD426
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0x0B31B5BE6A936F1C89DE7C95004C23ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0xB02701E83AC5874F36EB2E3B75B2E500
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x0312E0AE091F8A38977F1973E328E608
saw Sam.
0xB0FB0814AB0122AFD53B3002CC6D322C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0x98ED7B5F219772BDB64BFF32DA92290A
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0xD68AF627A8D039683D0C7B1681CFB807
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x79A35D903A217C905A6D1F41CDBA0B34
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xDEAF7F952F3F536592735020570C77ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x38AE085D4E5457CA2FE3CAD177B36F35
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0x2C936D8D29B0DADEE9739EB8469568E4
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x45702599697170A4BB7E6650527967FC
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0x9ED9A5D3E115DE331096161310B79C47
quietly behind me.
0x5CB185B11F87D1A743D68FC5D6E7910A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xDCB900251E52B8D4A1035DD56F53C61A
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0xFCDC126F4B8B0F1347D940AEF116F011

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x01BAE97C15A15BDDEDF7B093326A092F
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
0x076C995A53C9C882EC2E96EA383246E5

CHAPTER XIX
0x53A573BB5A190BFE45C775FA7B9B4397

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x48C5A9EBF9F40583A12794876FECDC43
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xB6EDCAE097EB8084BD81C7297286C468
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x44EACCDEA3AE29E25CC4DA669ACFD651
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0x63F945048EE05ED348AB09C51AF6D696
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xF4796D96C03ABE379D5A66677EEA20A6
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0xDA5DF32FE4BC8189064B43B3229D7F80
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0x31CC8454C4EE21FCA2691A5FBE5DB054
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0xFDFED9B0BF284334F78A632A719C0FF1
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0xCF5F8184E328D76A87FABB2406454AF7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x0F1D8C31ABAED7723225E28A3B4B1AAE
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x85EB5957FAAC098911A6A54012A8CC61
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x7CFF7EC8832D47ACEEB900D4441E43E4
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0x924C84835CD53363A87F76146A715D49
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x3CEB7AEC10A1575B472CBB6ECF28D6F3
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0x869C6BD142A14DD5A608A15230CAC5D0
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,

The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0xB33AEDD2A0E730531F8F7035CEB1D37B
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0xDCE144378100E579B802B4F142091B13
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the

I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she

took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xC281B8A10D1C33987B6046593BA4C628
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the

palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xD0C41AB12C525329A1F47EF6007A4C43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;

almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written

"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,

in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."

I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a

ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she

during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting

still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
0xDF8A8680C3876C4A659B34836450695B
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my

own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and

I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her

stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once

noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
0xB00032034829216BDD8A469130B95FE6
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically

turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
0xF6A720481CB69AE1BD82A150070C42C1
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I

looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,

indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the

fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0xCAB2F35F1B151014F7ED4035A93D6445
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0x66B3226266814A8FC5625B0D6893F990
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xD94E24C776A7707D222B795F030A142B

"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0x466A638F12B329EF873DE68C6F210B3A
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x87C16DBCA994F423AF66D6D6C83290BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x8FB9FA46A2DD4DDD0193FE628082EC76
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0x9F5892594833099D9DB04DCF8EB6BB59
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0xCFEBB502A0B96C344EF5DA299F241629

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x1614D8A747E17A2586AAE9113240A50C
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0x51FB9AB74ECE311C7714C1BA8C9DFC2E
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0x44012E1B25081B877FEBA5D8B45E89F1
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x37E94788C8D2D96313B4FA8FC3CCE60F
seemed to know what he was doing.
0x794C27962C19F1EB3BE3FEE58E62E0AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xF46B2E4DEBB1DEDD40B6BDE2D36CB426

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0x5B5B36DC632476C4E02DE9F83AA8AF36

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0xDB911183D3C022AA5E4378A2A8D1C4E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0x55312122D0FFCBF20CFB2638EDE5F359

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
0x0DBBA40B12FD6AF720A05F6AF9DD8794

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0xF18958EB1132F8A2E2D8E2659034762E
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0x3BF504D8C6812E62FD63C29D55CF2332
and dreary look.
0xA3DC3A2C2DF81AF209EF5DB3D8469613

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x4BB57A37ABD280545B2D42704E37CAF2
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x29BE26DD866FC43A79407F887C931E25

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0x6CD151C40022B7D46D3747626B51B609

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0xF115F61DFB0AF6E3983D7E26AEFBC904

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0xE09135A78FCF41428EDB6249112DA4BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x3E2780E4B82FCCAE84959ECBD01556D5
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x3D382E27A0E7FA82A6DA786DF737AAEF
doing."
0x6563C3726563C372BD2EB908AB7D4FA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0x0E2363E5AD3734C1C035007929B94C51
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x4C85B867195C2869DF3E0F6F463633E7
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0x98598017B4E62B22694D79F37C61962E
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x94A41CB6F8EEF7F62661CEDB96FE696D
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0xAA5EF3228753871DABA0668EF4A85AC9
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x1989BFA88F8423B51A2E2EADD79DA3E0
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0xF8F6C8AF78099F03353442E4BEBD3654
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0x30915D00922392A21B8AE6736FE92DE4
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x08ED33A1416A9F541EF29B8A49CF9D7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x92756280732A9DAFA7AF3E90BA060FED
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x044E0630D01E684E5BB8CA8F1A14A385

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x2A0271EBF82AFEDBC7829ED35BB402BF
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0xBA240F2F2C1F400AF846F55D4DD5378C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0x228B3C90EC71AF0B2DC71C04DBADCC61

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x40F58C56FA7B291AE8E69481EE0EFA29
strange?"
0x07BF29134F9B239AB4274A6CDA6E5550

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x45DBBEEAE424F0ECD96FB4BEA1B7B214

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And Mason?"
0x1E6290647CEC6FE0CFFB8515EF9796D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He was laughing too."
0xE6FC3BDA723D29B22F46FC1185B5BA2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0x38854E2F685409286C35A1E90E0BA4B1
Jane?"
0x266FBC86266FBC86C20E520079A92111

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x179EEF901AA0B677926ADF85BFBD97FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x89C69BF02748C1422570CE66D0BCAC3B
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0x45CB3E1553EA8372F1476D58A4D03638
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x416AAD57408AAA8E8606820620187F48

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x20A845C4CB99E63A49503798ADB6DC99
you."
0x53A52ED653A52ED6C8E9894D2835FB7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To comfort me?"
0xEB4DBE19567325F5B6874D783D8C926D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x73677C2DB2DDDC6C5B6D82B1D4751C2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x715059FC70EAC2087118E07A4FA4E941

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0xB3FBCCEFD6D66B50E54C769A437A47A3
care nothing about it."
0x5E217004AC83C500AAF0FD631BABB31F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0x2F41C70C62A66BB3DA3FD1FAB983EBEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0xC729E86E7444FE4BCEC8F15CCB71BC61
you, I am sure, do."
0x6D9B7A5BDF6333A4BF6E43168B6A4316

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0x50B63FA9A4B438FA96E66985073F60E3
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x2503986BF8E9FB95B8E2274D2EE60945
and then leave me."
0x677CEAB0AA1D6D7B22404F704786121F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0x7A2A2F18F512A67F725BEE684C65B43D
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x69411117E71C24309446B5833E43E785
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x8A69E786648351B2D43ECD3EBD6B10D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x7909B832D637E2CD9CDA86508C5BB2F4
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x86A065B8A1089897C295B26123E53E3E
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0xD6AB9CD310562AFB81F45218C7729547

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0x0D3DE8602D1D41F67A60E618B4AA956B
asleep.

CHAPTER XX
0x7E23FFF52D351588E1B086D2DFB2170F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0xCF12C91B8539A12665EA42152B30A6F9
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x3AF61A173677161DB6DAB03A0CE75F5B
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0x16664F27011BC49091035786DC376764
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x16F33F650121E542FA81F9C7B5CE18C9
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x05A20C8FF43FC767BF1ACD71D4CDA1FC
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x351350B869A99E3F9E5402EA0CA756D5
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0x9667E408688C9E8DB347D866F05728A9
the curtain.
0x538443CF4FF6B51D34B70A7B91012D6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Good God!  What a cry!
0x5E44BD19A6473E32A5A957780C5AB093

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0xBA128C382454D884B1CC985AB71F46C5
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x1C37D6443A7A1BC633102BE069295DC1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xF4D386BBCEEC58BC761B534167E8612A
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0x340F992F8391A7E1C01C459D838732DA
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0x5E626ADEBFF6212BC1E2779A5C396218
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0xC74C91F6FC62A5014730491C5D2CAB09
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0xAF17AA30F617A526D8FF35C8E8A3DF34
it could repeat the effort.
0xFCC3D13327A59A088A4334E4E2C9826E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0xA3EB9C2546DB0A111ACA0CB0A8244510
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x3DBCC4CCA29110D5E1BEE9957FE02506
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0x8EE9EEF0FA91EF9525988DCD7A71C060
voice shouted--
0xE8FC83452AD714974C2D739ABC49881D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x15CFDF433DFBF02BC23B35670A15F538

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0x0290FAA6FFC6AA31F204655508124775
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x0ECF896730B66BE0DF256404450FB752

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xD160D3EBD8171E4AAE19004B73A2D24C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xF029F4690F67E565C4380264FBD6E64C
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0x470519D7968C5295FCCBC14BC9228291
was silence.
0xEB9E1B55318400F2CBA79528EF8C73FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xB98DA6B1197327B8E81B421296D31991
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x436DAAF44A1ACB12770AA3CFEAFE0824
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x4C7BA81B7491CE4501AD59EBE1FB99CD
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0x8B6A84CB6B803A5CDE614A75120B094F
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0x1E2708F422924CCF2C603C7EA857324B
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0x65110374F9746113F29EC07A884EC584
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x2CA7BB30545DB491BE834F0FDF14EEE2
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0xCC4F627240DE59118D0B7EC20EC39C64
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0xC78517ECFAD96C6C7D0437183E24BA06
confusion was inextricable.
0x02F5B80FFC32BA511947D74C30B47C94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x7D0E4CE113C0587DD6885FA7FD696E06
in his bed."
0xC8CF8295AE6D3C122CFEAA47010D7F0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0x3CBBF06B46AF2344BFF60D2880FD1BE9
coming."
0xEF1E6086B5C72F2AD4D816902F01E9BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0x902D0D8C1E2F4B5E08AB04B0E486CD4E
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xB8F9BD57E2900F5B13BDD13B8A86D989
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0x691D8C1227A37BBCDE4C6D0CFE475E7F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x035BCC5A208E3A8C06CD3C62A92BC1DA
worst at once!"
0xCDC613644C1726ED523424B54BD4454B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x793C47563CAFB35AA19D1E36E21D3557
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xDF83307E31FAE8E5B24D6E020722B4CC
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xD93F79AFBF1232304B88CA1A3E03818D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0x2439AFCC3981C6885F0B0D9E02CD1567
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x55E4CA23183F63A252D9598FFE3F5005

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0x6FCB5F226F9EC6FFC81E12AA0DF73F1E
by an effort, he added--
0x8BD6DE3A76389E07A4229EB761E8D130

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x743B3BD49946ABDB5DD60074BA2B2CEF
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0xAFF11CB70E1214B01E89DEB3F962EB3F
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x6876DFBBB872694C4A9B981B4361E58F
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x86601378D4B9A29B2578DC3BDD376479
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0x67B597D46EDA9727CFE2B0E641592FF9
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x7FF77D39277C69979B14C4CF404C73AF
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x36CF20AF1CB75590E504F782979DD15C
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x256A2F19BABF53F78D751709DE9A5A36
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x41FA71A36B7FAEFFEEAC53621C1AD8D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0xCC67E018B71E6DAB8E83418A4592B782
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x5871BBD00714E228A7ADDD060DB1CCBC
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x61A0DDF2BAB1B731A889EBBF9AE74021
had left it.
0x7F0CCA0E07BAC3F9A311D7D5F67FAD2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x4E14C6189786004E6B848886A9D31B10
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x7D8DD9D9FA4BEE696E3D93281E09C026
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x11A8DD93474AFA7968C8EB72C295FA92
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0x6A31DAEDA18CC0737DA5D3F399B01659
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0x40368182FF98E709CAF997654C1D65C2
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0x77449151E7BD0D0752E584F4B7436E88
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0xAAFEECF96D8B2CD9EFD29B83DD65E44B
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0xBEF9CC6BA8F0E8A560CE2AD7C1FE8804
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x5C76BCC7AEA2B7C808C4482FBCF68BDD
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0x61CA640E3AFF586E7FEEF3302D12CB95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x32DCD613A204A38659941C41C92702A0
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x8E04DC61CB31046FA01758A64118BBCB
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0xB2256CA6578FC21038E3426D3FFADF06
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0xA16F0CBF9E202391B18CD6ED0B157F6E
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0x82E318D1179D17A89E2F9F40DCD1A435
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0x3EAEDAF088139C32192FAF91D566626C
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x48C6C0FC9C895E716CB75DCEF5592974

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0x090839356C115A1AC4A68672A5204925

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x31267AED728410947D248A7C9236BC8E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And dressed?"
0xE9CFE9820E359D4C89A2E86EE695BABF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x26D6501FC56911E4D33BDC690051CB22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x3DB2FB01EAF1C3D47720E3CA9232428E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0x5F9ECA015B550653E4382A00F5C66D99
noise."
0x3ACD551B3ACD551B2FB04D75CFEF146F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x121907C562A734796C8035732B2DD71C
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0xB93D2F9AD5685D3AA50BC34FD4B4494D
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0xA74038681668561436AADC9040EAC899
side.
0xFADD2CECFADD2CEC5148C36B17CC94AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x86C8C6E4F23228C9E0580B61ED3B41E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0x5F6B6D1E613C4CFD78DE1661E5D37EF1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go back and fetch both."
0x8592F2A6C69D9DB5EEA6D825697FA850

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x05814497F94AF73F0E19AD8B254D3C10
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x85DAD7FF96345694AF0641986680DC03
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0xE2E107E232D984AD01657AF22724CCDF
he paused, and addressed me again.
0xC29757E3793F8193A9C6AE9648B7F672

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x1C8E2B54520F1BBD9059B38AD83F5FDE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x9DC5E0E019727EAC05912C7439948221

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x7071AE9EFDC1025B6F609DFCB5800C57

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0x238190BEFA7AEA0F8004CB1F080D5CC4
fit."
0x5C10C5EF5C10C5EFC9CD5181A3E22446

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x16E86BF9E6CA2CED4129CB6956811B67
the key and opened the door.
0xC497A8FDDA8D123BD4038569EB292670

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0x702DFF158D9B426D99B5135971DF0629
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0xA3069C0BE81BD5CD1B0A6D74E24D1693
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0xBF0F4BD4653C609375E6CF9710985AD2
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0x9F42B5A926614A6F6B395B0BE31AF48F
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x4C2A6B656425847244B34731DA278073
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x745B32E0D5BFEEB139C95A4D0D0D26C6
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x4E824858A4FC30E0F84EBEA26D4D08E1
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0xAC3F8A283E1728F7F7625C11D5ABC2FC
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0xF8C1B966076B4ADD1545D975AE47FCA3
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0x7A337F60B6EA623C031EB269A4AED8ED
came out and closed the door behind him.
0xE8F5C4EBC47F18446E1332D835868A4A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0xCC2633E331BEF6AC3EDF22E3CB6256B8
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0xF844425AD8CE04C1E2022AFDD160D50F
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x790A72C96FB4BF5D95B53D763A32D080
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0xD9DD98C6CA0AAA8DE2A40A1087B7C3C9
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x60DAC50FBEDFB351936969029BFD3A04
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x85C57153F3C38A0DFB8D6BD466275D5F
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0x490A0F836DA2B741EA57D31B9AB2B60B
blood.
0xA5899E14A5899E149590B021CE875EB7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0xE5401BCD85121128962CA9D844BFB29B
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x4007B772DD673759E1EABF5034DC51C9
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xBEE526515D7816CD22068AA5181D9F60
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0x6DA3815EE9116DE0167FF492EF4E1278
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x65F3087030C568A7A68734C5C4E13597
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0x0C9A1042FEE62F688216B937C79DEE30
blood, trickling fast down.
0x5D8AAED627DCD3F2ABF2D526FB24E076

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x018BBD66135FCD6CC067B62581A7DDB3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xC8AC281EACD09D5C0C196EB5B53008A6
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0x25E0753AEF1C50B457877045BB2BD8FE
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0xA21DFF2E622E1B199D4FC9910D8F2C7F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir?"
0x4D00744A4D00744AE093B41C1CE9F0EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0x1C2EDA10833C52C00F40CA121938D6FA
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0xCC6AA72C652600C215BF07CAF3ED980B
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x630BF996E477D656129029CD277C84B7
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0xDDADE7829C14E0A3C932268D13A538D8
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x0C87C4E92CFC60822F0ACE4BE3361E33
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x537138B1954323A3AB704A7DEA91AF2D
consequences."
0x26967F34470A4390F23527E4342B35D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0xB434FF7340BC953C2F81BD6A54E91060
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xA24E49841710DD7638CAB95E44C8BE42
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0xA472E78C47FD6D5F2383E3C57F4BE165
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x773F709D13F996BDBA004959BD436E72
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0xD066C682BEEBE06C0C9D6C12E6A5D1BB
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x036502FE45371F295A1F50394C983282
step ceased to be heard.
0xB151BEB0EF484B6573250AD4A087D8E7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0x24A2E6F10F4E17A12F333CD0B3D72AEB
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0x07EA20ACA8D80658AA26C55244268022
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0xD62C6E5EA0991C1A8147CADF36082881
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x3286AACC3F8673B8FD36C106B4F03E5C
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0x7837E7E2A66E74EC7821FA88863314C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0x1D197F4B49FEE1103BF7DFF5A72CCEDD
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x823443F0AA7BBE37667F624138ED012D
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xA244F6543E3FD530682E9021A8417991
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0x7D7AA69E3D99445E5F58565BC02C30ED
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x0D342576ECADB2B3E09A48E543578ECA
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xBDBC6ADD3BDC177CD5BD6BA327231746
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x354AFD6A89C18E03D6CB3054A1383BC5
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0x8FC4CF35D19E6B752DF6E6E9CF254883
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0xE978859C45697528A6EC3D22D34CF8D9
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x10D4442C54A2D849061C0689A6278D0C
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x5E88B47733DC13F136753DBDCD26FE13
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0x4BF98153601CB12F68E2CDDE39D09D90

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0xF6674E90BCD5300CF62BB5D1DBC37558
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x9ECD96C2015F69ABDF684C927319BFDE
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x0F52AA7070CBE5B55DFEC1C9515446E8
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xA68CB07C351585BE54F2F8BFAF0FA5D3
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x8745F81538D20B4E6325FCFA22641587
subordinate's form.
0x06620782CA8AA026E7C82652E28CFE55

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0x2C49E1B0E3A0EAB074807A03C9D00B5F
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x7B24B318D1AE5E999D2654CFE2AD517F
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0xA63BF5C6E48A24BFAAD5B0A284F0CE0F
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xA3137120C33D846ECA41EB2D1B4B1301
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0x376AA6A639C48D5FDAFC0BD749609CE1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x06DEE60E6487087347FFAFE9F8364FF7
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0xC26F91DF67BF536F9232341348AADBE4
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x7E3BF8693DD5F2F345B712D1057056F7
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0xC27E1CB444988C05E6EA530354F73889
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x7FF431E72E29EAC611D740037D551A0B
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xC073108C3DA938A3A4E2FA1F8CB559E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xD5121A3911E8FAC3C51574436693EF59
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x6572711FD1E1BF6DD527C733D622B344
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x1946DE3A2E21220062DB955A9588BE2E
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x45CE0C5F1808E41E80BC76426F6FCE80
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x6D34983B6CDD9C67521845E1EA600CF4
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xB0C1FA8294CB6E443C261A08BF43736D
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xCE171F1CD81068C79205D8A296590C2A
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0xA02D9DB11520EAE4B161AA50CAB9D6F3
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x3EB0D1F45A0605D78D5DE3AFB8C56C84
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0xC32EE050EF33CD8AA8C6A8D6FA9553A3
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x8545F20F24DE007F707965E8E1E0C3B0
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0x1E135F9587DCC7B3536B154A16976154
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0xC09BE01E47AEA85989146F5CBA57C7C9
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x9DC03CE8FBF717ACF4F06678407ABD5A
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x3DFF1EFD8219E0BF95259140D804FF24
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0xA17D5D24FFCD4E1243432060F73BB619
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0xFD7CD7CF72B1390A8E0A261A3ED01F9F
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x87119E2274E2E2AB6F1E7EA4B664ECB5
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xC21E1D787E9DB434B3C54B4298EFE41E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x582CD279EF0F086668FB7C31706DBD05
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x85C6D1699CED76B848F2E21FA4559209
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0xFF05AC4D3D54B07EAEA503981C6311AF
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0x3E9EEAFB9D1F1C700BB521F12C8CB36F
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0x6EC4E4F466051718D742A85D485A33F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0x07E9B346575B42A40DB36265079A9A50
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0x44AE30AA18A3E3BB4C0800CD45994223
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x4EF4F611F3176D6F9CC6EDA3B856C285
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xF7E7ADA05CA8E4ED43FFED7FFAFF3367
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0x8A4610622BBB710BC85C566BF97B5AB1
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x74428D4A2C5251318425E71E96A1F96E
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0xC0B12CA0C90FE78CE5766400D6B5A2B0
I might not even speak to him.
0x4DB731D00DD2B2385E92BE5F535A1C72

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0xB1F885E7769A5A901245D0F9D3F992E8
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0xDA2956B333D35C60E42511D82B768709
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x2E8ED658A4794F8DBC196B6AD5D025AC
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0x186A73DC6D0E0F81CDD300D2E7A90B79
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0x733AA0CD70C15184363A76A4C554E1A4
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x1C41C06FD680804E62938C3031313547
shorter.
0x1EF8A5C3F214E0DEB69FD65DA0FC36D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xF1BEA2DA0ED34FDBDFC6CCC4A97529B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0xB67E026FEADE21D616D827DFCDA8E066
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0xE60D54D9C9F7AFA0F5824A5A10ECEEF3
patient downstairs and all."
0x72D8A23AFEE7F965D0F11B1E65980E94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x23740DD5D40FCCF6E8946D7527D0E30B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0x68740F8F8146AB69E75122274479822D
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0xACB0AADD3A066D5CCF160AF4F87AC8DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0x33C253D88C80EE5A998241003EE827D0
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x0BB310AC6A3998754ACAEB83D452E019
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0x4E7DB4E4A2FDF7DD9CC3D29E24EB5DF4
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0xF4096AF1A354E70DCC33B1559D44F05C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0x6B2FB2BD551C7BEFA71987FB58A0BAAE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0x48E6C74906217909A3F8180DF85C9D15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x7BC759ACBAB35CF66967BF723470056E
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x70F572354046F678C8B3F3EAB1CD4941
there's no danger."
0xFCE65CD3BCF374989E73077B4CD1D97C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x23B399409DEE7DEC9468A559161F3C0E
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0x3FA75F920C23D43D9A7F20A2159F38C8
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x0F8BF9842F1D183A0890F97A9B3CA3C6
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0xFA2D9F7E4E12DDDB8645C9E2E782E83D
here!"
0x3D4797EE3D4797EE73CFE46CB9AB7253

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0x7E67D6EB16BB0D2604E5F5B516929B85
Rochester got the knife from her."
0x3BE691853A6F2C69BC198328E86B623E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0x2114344D39EF2A9CC67FA80891C5356C
said Mr. Rochester.
0xB91F669CEC2C405B5F8520399B141A48

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x209C4ECDE36C1698FE1A9625F3721128
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xCF61D7E8573D78DE97C6122871F6A160
looked so quiet at first."
0xD3C89128D2C680608276BD11A1B0F41C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0x683D49D3618EE9EB881249A6DE9FDEB1
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0xDBA16EFED5981C79073D9E16C2D72D6E
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x2A8ECA8841E42C62750B23281F047CFB
alone."
0xA33BB091A33BB091C9209EB692E47E7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I thought I could have done some good."
0x47550CD0FCF6710EE124F54B998BC687

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x25B1C190A6288B808AF1C120FBD79BED
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x9E00579B2D8E5E10C207E8B68ABDCE39
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0x8855D81551B7A69166C8C0734E27D09E
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0xD98736986423517D20E65D7086EDC94A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x56B3264313AA7759220ADE2F77804978
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0xF75E121F4356C0C4D3FC1B2389EA0D65

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x873E7674026E058BB57DAC064D748106

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0x6122E7EF3CB3BBE52F1F5B7ED7BAC026
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0x807E47934CA4604A11CF6B6A7776CF0E
said--
0xED2ABE6DED2ABE6DFFECE641E1E5B044

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x74BB667F0B2ADC0742CDD6BF0F4BF063
it."
0x3DD9BF183DD9BF187A0075D9575A1273

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0x238CA4A07054D2A418C6CB3A2E83455E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x0DB7B299E4B76F2934EF97FA26FEBA47
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0x5695C8E4DC05907BAB7B0612ED6EE23B
think of her at all."
0xC2C24611CC1AB57C7E5A7A81EFB445DE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xDE2572016A6A92E513842B568E83E1F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0x909130C8A7A394909F3B36E3DCAF297D
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x1E689D00837D8A3697583BAB06CEABC7
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x3410451BC2CF8FB80F125A965E4C0A8A
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xAB1D5B24221A795B2EE5F259C5D84EF9
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x0CA87B8505875FCC97DE0295AEAD2699
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x601FDEEDB67E594603EF38AFBA49DB96
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0x477E0E16050201F6C6BAC7F81A2AB9D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x418EFDFA3C8B128364CE31C4C5CD72F0
and returned with them.
0x5A94142EC35C6C6D3C49229AF30FE349

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0xB552BD9990CF03DAF48D92447CC74A41
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0x75B7426D3CB9FE28BF2127E4F1FF6EA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I retired as directed.
0x8A284D408035B748A5F15A836F5EC28B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x177ABDB55595475F6B46F1B7A8ED117B
Rochester presently.
0xF6D43C13754CD8238FDFE7D8E8710B1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir; all was very still."
0x9F0A75B98C1E56C6F68BE3FB832C77FB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0xAC6406C523352268005D2517A3F62098
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x7D58F0B5E7C34354B29965A43D272C2D
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0x28ECAEB6C7960ABE2FAF703F39BEF6CD
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xF6145F446D1538BB912485267F9B8C89
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0x982F44B3CE8F678DC8403607481B792B
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xC5BD0536F95B5E7482B08E6D14A950E1
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0xA12A3D375912BDA5AC5C6097FC188B7C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0x7EF4EED21F37BC7E9BDE2C3DDB2E2DD0
edged with fur.
0xC8378629ED6C50F54DF84AEC81F30CAF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0xFC65A6D9605C8E51E23918BED5BC7316
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0xE18D4EBA1A687E59D84B9C5B6399B998
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0x60429D13A1A5A6B2EE56B93323D18E41
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x5512945105DCC4FE0721762976FD2E0D
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0x616F6DC7349B03768A22D717935290E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x8055157BEB8816824EFD8A6845A58A18

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x6DC16FE8420D349EA9F23A069C1BBE70
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x62E51BCD01D2E4A7711FC07547EF97AF
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x68864EA8A96DE41D417E74A4A61A61C5
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xA26CEFADB89F14FC5D006254A4387D5A
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xF3D52A545C04989025F0E9B5DA9A4085

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0x3E81634230470CD113189C66380D2BBA
the washstand.
0x83F484F62D098C132BF50E617A38F5C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x4DDB4463679738CEFDE7EFFCAD232353

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0xA506304450A540647E1A7A23A77DE5DE
to Mason.
0x2648AC66C3D8DF4616FC41925D690AB6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x942935A4FAA8F625C414448706B9923E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0x221BAD6D8EA070B8811D84742FA26326

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0x5040547DC538AEA9C9A5CA915F43E0F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0x5E7063D5274A2EF5B701603093651DAF
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x2A6A218B4DD45273E978C8F532D3AFC0
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xCAF4891331332668378BBD300A50DCD9
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x469ACD1B8518615092404B047B65CC0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0xB51C012931247677969FB596F8385F2D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The patient rose.
0xCE843710C526FA333B1A188579C4681E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x50CBF5F3AF6767300E587A2784D9FDDB
step out--that's it!"
0x2E1D15C3B0462FC836171D87B89AF2DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0x00BB9CA844112C7CABEEBD4C4F1420A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xA0776C6AA73BF61FAFFDAB4D3BA0013F
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0xFB591B3FC9152BE8A06A63B87098D23D
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0x5A530BBB67C19659F780A94C08534394
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x2265693D938A2D8E0BC8B32A80308D4D
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x7AA7DB0C7C2D9EF0BDE9AAC450ABD3AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0x324807684191C07C779081EDA9291E11
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0xD959B358DC53692DADFCEFD4381A5841
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x0CCFC4197968A2449068378CD0A4AEDA
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x0BC5F3DF9EC3E32087DEE2B7F191C45A
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0x0698D6029D3C7F71E60B140477892212
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xA7217A39096D63D4DD84B7724DDDF6A9
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0xB2796D542DFBA8D966E8EA1FEB97E307
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0xA54D385CD636EB4CB1834B4FE2C93F41
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xBDFB2CE98B8D33E8ECE16B11B20A0E8A
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0xC89B160C320BE97E1A66EC8CED158889
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x660CB9FE882AD8BD4530D5E16ED9E5A0
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0x9CE178ABD6747439B3FA1B5E69756A6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0x358369D6BF3E224A8DBB6479E2E5C24A
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xCDD37540E1EE5B83B1314ACF6488E1E4
chaise; Carter followed.
0xEFFA4574035717490493AFBA9B2B9549

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0x9C6A97ACCA562197E83E662CDBE53ADC
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0x83B7FDFF3C3E6E7D799F778F84F89192
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0xC3E767B0CAC135D9E633520F8F5CB2ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xE5F8248A378C2B7F6B8213DFE72BB09F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0x0035428B5EA4CE7012961BDC2A5C0910
Dick."
0x66A344EC66A344EC4074C6DB9638D341

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fairfax--"
0xADE8750621D1B2D2CC6F13AB970ED845

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well what is it?"
0xFDBADE3DE188EE7B16B17BC41B8D0BA8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x66C57033B7180EEC429B51AE72E67A63
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0xDBF921F4876B347C3E89E5D5CC652DDF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0xA023A7CDB2896B7AE217ECB70A6B4702
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0x9B154AD16116C4929FA062C838BE8623

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x3E08EA48B7668DC1B10ED8E6C0582E10
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0xD1DC2D411C6E793E0E755038785F04EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0xCB3569C598B066AFD3A84433439F525D
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x4D2DD9F1A21501E8A27977319ED1CBDE
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xA490A27D632CF0EA41963EEED3DE55CA
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x961F0B23C05BD350331C385175F3D9B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0xC9BBDD8F25E05D26CFB334D465A6137B
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x5203F87D1117BC9076A5A5643AC505D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x8A026FA9FA37DFC5D28A1B756F17229B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xC8B5B9B40C93511A6E256037CBF33F3F
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x2BC6E16D3FE3189AFD74C3B569F31169
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x4C182F3D6C4ADCDF1F2993336BA1C05D
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xDCC5FC96E69E19C5BEA071CB1888987A
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0xE61C17B6652EE5DE000EC787B19827A0
pure."
0x5F9F14B35F9F14B3A5080E4A0F0A5F3A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x4CB9A4C52666B7252EDCE2B773B68069
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x014AEDD0A5B50223A321B73DFDFE75F3
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0x23DDF21E5397D27506922012B07BD008
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x2AC4D95BD30FA5A6C118216876B9F2BD
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x04CCF252F15FE3345A1EE642970F8726
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0x3C57E00E3E1C8C8C2AE6520432994871
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0xC2822C10364D908721922A622A1F83B3
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0x29E266FE31AE064956B7179B5E31D3E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0xB870DC2C5BB56083B68246BFD2F791AD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xD3E4B0646D28C23544A1AC8911225B3E
me.
0xD786AAADD786AAADD786AAADFB021C99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you, sir."
0x6EDB99EFB36B13ECCF50836D17BEBBA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x481FC0E8701190D270932436902C5D97
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x48C4B92A49B6AAFCDEE6AB114DC460D5
atmosphere?"
0xB508A9D84DFEE1A3DC2125823784CDC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do, very much."
0x7166DC6259EF0AA9A6B3C069886BCD84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0x08F3F3E4DBC1B0CC0E9ABD052E08C4E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0x7533BA0BA36E9DB4F57FB1EE3C4777A9
with Mason?"
0xE029476C2A33F377179E17167E201286

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0xCD8B9B60BC3F0B17C37E0F20220D8D4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x0047AD09D7F053C4760EBE9920ED783E
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x791D2B7BC7903C629B5327B34D609F17
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
0x2A8CC5CBA02E0F2257E30A1A235034F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
0xC1EFBECCAE42EA03513C08E895E6DD5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your

thoughts."
0x05ADC51E7C3BC3071D9E54C2527813D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
0xEB5E3DC9B6397E47F15718ED85C92CAF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
0x11B3D8993535AC49A3E0AB09E0C6E668

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
0x815279F21B9D989137712F294E7A7706

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
0xBC09A02FF964F2CA97BD0CAA3881FA5A
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
0x28013C9CE314DAF11C84FB34A9C769F3
spue fire any day."
0x55BAC3483851A1BD4F1E391560AD6EED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0xD8B5EEAE5621FE319A6CF27A4DA20930
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
0xB63E4FD2F79A0B8ADF9184F987524338
you."
0x53A52ED653A52ED6C8E9894D2835FB7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
0x239BAA63CC6AC8929D2CCEEB0F01E67E
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
0x9469E4481CC32301F3F646BC996443F6
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
0x4A08E29C5206017AF11984409BB2BC2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
0xDC44E167A6ADB30B194DCFB363CF235C
how to avert the danger."
0x305EB38C8C6DE629F5D52F8CD09B16F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0x7CBBC74DD13E555DD32C9B000670AD7D
from him.
0x9E2994C87AA70DD82B51BCC57957337F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
0xC49F228D339B4D0373D3703C28937D1F
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xAE7471D76A21E47DA62EC3C79E60DEE4
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0x7DF9BA4C01CB70ACC6083E3F6394619B
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0x0EE51B7CC4E7A4008CCAD0F8B1C43882
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x8BD1C8D42E291C4B1CE6B3C4AA7BB0E4
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
0xD3167A98DF585ECC5E7FEA5BEF4CDFC9
friend, are you not?"
0xFB004524DA854A9880474B13210428F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
0x1B46B69C5EB668CF49F21F1276D26F23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0xC21AF8B820DA132C0D8A6285284E6810
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0x22CCE0DB6D0D9C048D809D1305B8068E
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x43CE212F59CA1B07FB4439CC90E1D413
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0xA6CCB9F3BB3785892EFC8CB97105841C
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x2375C201F4C0B5177092FC2242BD802A
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0x02F64C469FFA4394ED6056D3DBA601C8
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xCBBE725ECE4E44B71634A2FD9C4E1115
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x1F17A709DD48421F11788067CD269EA2
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x5AA8681A222E50B5E40C614E40BA4E69
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
0x789DF9B419623F0151F3FF3330BE9169
me at once."
0xAF6BB801558D4E8D24944A58C72D28DE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0xFAF4A8C8FEB6254E5E55EC8B92C61272
you are very safe."
0xA4DCF35FC9E167F8E164A6975D3AB61D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0x31D41F172628D2B3876A2F5581C556E7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0xA734AFFF3D0B4A5F329F11CDBCDC0956
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0xFD484B632845A277D91BC8D3A9966FD5
before him.
0x94CF3727C1925B0E05DE3127B5A0573D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0xA89689B89A96EA45F6143C16BCE5F80D
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x8D93361B9A180C7FA025CF681975160C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
0xC6BA7FE4DE960CBF8591936D4C067CAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
0xB6C77F798B751638B64232BA578E6766
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0xD9E2BC9BB2725ACCF517744F534AFDF0
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x85548DE5D53483974D7E26E3ABF292CA
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0x52CEF6561B6863B117B75E761F2F4E7B
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0x50C24AEBEA11E8F0DF8DCA1448C7E5A8
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
0x5ABE884DE3FE0D55FF5CC58AE3BFF225

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0x1032440AB534B723B1919122E121EDC2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0x79DBB4441F7557EF70C6804894016E37
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x9B1458CFBD65F3FD4581B3FE813B5B5D
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x9B8627B655D0475D85FC98101C3A5072
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0xFDC03BC92FB65CB96F27EE0552D304C6
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x48F46AE3D84416B22FADA51F3E79895F
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0x1C3776B7DE4AE942EE84889A34D42D91
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0x07C3D298E70B3B7D5D5E0F387D00DDEA
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0x6EEAD176BDE003351FC4150465FE4BDA
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0x1E039D0F8CFD58C94CEB25B98651C48B
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0xC14B699FD4E0E6D611D19DA0CD9913B0
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x8F4015117AF4FD771047E8B358F09519
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0x639E326286AE1AC4AD008FD7DFD599BA
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x126AB47127E18C22F930A269441C82A4
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0x9A9BDC9CA644B0C6DADCCE9CD15F0A08
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x2832616A2436304C5B2DE90123465845
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0x3953A83A999F7A67D3A8D99611CDA5BB
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x95EF280D327A734487CB050F06AE9976
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0xC478E2B309C872F48F8EA5F8D044DF51
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x5B1C77CC59D3EC6CCE21AC755AA30391
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0xCF643FCA5BDD0D716BE1C70644CA65F6
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x22EFC1193F2B35F7DF82996FEBBF3954
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0x5F2A2AA8073514E7AD8C024C7EBD70DC
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0x9C079253D6727EA4EF00276C8170D306
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x64B6A4B6A2E1E11276CFDA863AEA67D1
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x281B9A8796CC309C373E06B590A40961
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0xF692267D0EF74B89F641170B8A1AF130
judgment approves?"
0x2A457E1FBF708C50D567E60DC53A116B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0x598921B8043D505BAE6647DF3A7D3F00
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0x321DCB60E4E667640433388220294C21
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0xECB496DB5B5AA5B08EFD3EF75A06C527
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0xF1E379AEBD4EBF1CD3AFB1BA48722BF9
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0x9A46F2ABB59B4A83DDFB88510DB05D02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0x03BA05B9C328BB4831C7E681169CF28D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x646A647EC73EB347BFA2EA6B05300D23
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0xEFA23EE57FD2A38A863D132B94D511BE
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0x049A38AC9737A834698670CA1C37EB46
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0xA99C57749EBE079E45A030B0B72E7ED9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0xED89DE2E6BB8B91EC74DFAFECEEF5686
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x32D055110D8621F4389ECCFE9B474005
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0x28AD4C7BE1261911FA668C1B24E8E822
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x67CB58032197991C8FD5360325293423
amend and solace to heal."
0x24087DC148B29518FAB4120BC501ED6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0xA0900565A579E4BE03434CA34ABC39D7
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0xFFDE1696694D621EF3A8B9147405E95A
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
0x48F60FB94A826BAEACA80E78296B993F
instrument for my cure in--"
0xC2908A9A9FBC3167A5C6F64BED156F2C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xD9C72CAA59C84A4B42EBA4FA2CBDD110
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0xDD1A72276E3EEC63B7818D4D659F675D
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x729D68AB265E283126F2BFECB38B27D1
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x423138D9A81A44DFF9003AE5ABC46F62
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x0C3F0EF762A2DB68870E7000497A1F35

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0x7D3DA00CFEEF73F1FAC556E2A668DBA3
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0xAA9A61636EF5DE711E43952D23A52C57
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0xE9325A413C7DA14AF8A24632F907DA3F
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0x17BCDF21C00615053C26F3ABD0B476F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0xFACEE92EE85DA141CC8A7448E37081F0
came back he was humming a tune.
0xAB35F92A5C476AD3F23A061E67859CF3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0xF31BB7EBEC5FC8DE1169511F2A2DBC34
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x404ABAB7F2DA36E79164A71DB099C0BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Curse you?  No, sir."
0x57A886370300A07AFE79020FA6432BA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0x4C9A18250152F4F84E10787C949E8FEF
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0x5974DFFB685A2053CB987FA766CE6EC3
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x73069EC2428A5462D3995E5736B06B89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
0x8F564BED8327DCACECC2C1CC1F03302A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0xD4BF37C302AF969986BDCD063FB352F0
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x724E6FEA8DD56341F8DC4A3EB6FE0C45
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0x218352712B9C99F28628E7C5E9A338ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
0x74AAB03AA74DB47113CA78B311F81A57

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x8FCD0054EAB3176A07370DEC4F3D5E0E
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0xEAA30A2616A7DF94DF4FF68E68D77992
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
0x43AE79DC9B1F839B4B3A26DD05DBA97B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
0x3A8571B0EBDD7DB55CD7122477CA198D
cheerfully--
0x82B4A830500931221AEB58B93B9DDA5B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
0xEDB107E1DF37691AE45B94631FBDD619
I rose at four to see him off."

CHAPTER XXI
0x73C77321F313752FDC1B8B2F45405EDE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0x6D896DAFF1AF7671804E42E20FBE1053
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x89BDD82A20B3E86265F76BD8BEE84333
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0xA689DC774069B1CE2709A639FC957A97
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x5AA8053E828F442BE7146060F6AB871E
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x26675360CAE2AF26835828108AB4F46A
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x108FB5EB3ADD2F3A993E5FE85869B8B8
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x23E00EE406F17A478D2FF454F2FE1A09
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0xC5FDBE31C218A39EDED039881A27F9CC
man.
0x0432D8990432D8992516D21C59C90BDD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xE406B7EAC74840E868935172385C338C
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0xA28EE36AE310026D4A2D9C1312296307
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x90591F8C1E1CAFABCE5D4A50C44029BE
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x4CD34292B41C30DDFADF9AFD19816F55
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0x36EC2DF1F4C6C64F90A148CD7B7C4565
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x53097057AE3D7094AD4DE39EB3836E10
little sister.
0x880F3EAD7A78A26EF28623BC2CF5DE00

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0x8A50212661633674DFEC4FA91146A870
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0xB2E2F2190A2A89FBAA8BFDC08D28AD89
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x4C81C0E8DD2015AB43138C880FBDEE7E
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0xB11D17F28F7EC109705F6DF3B9734F13
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0x189AE25A0DA35AF7E7621F67D814ABD4
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0x3248AC6CB66D4FA612D1D1AF4E66BF6A
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0xF58BD89F3FBA91D1186746E04F08B2F2
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x7D0A0DDE659A3AA12A43030DF8C91E08
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0xC8EF81F524BBE655355BD03245F166EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x27FF7F6175573EF29F6F6579FB56401D
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0xB127A908675584E7E55B9903CF0ACC1E
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x720A9397E56371886707C1BB6EEB5E59
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0xED9A9D0B577CA9E4C01A6DCC00E2A159
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x4B1F55EB042AC52F3409D741F3241F4E
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xE1C71CBC2E1B24393FEFDAA9A5295B81
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0x0C972345117D816D0022401543F4B794
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0x05A06C0619AFBA44CF35097046AC6A9D
was surrounded with a crape band.
0x924C44630DF684CCE613D10041C3533A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0x379240BB8A44C00D7C6789751AF9B488
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x1A33D35256F409F0936178EAF7BC24AD
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
0xA832987EE2B43C72515FBF6F1831F054

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0xA75D7503D7B8DBB810B97E9440B20292
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x3EDA17FED6ABDDAD35B4876AB76E5A0C
are married to Bessie?"
0x6FD85F6C7EF003DEE06BC9A236FBA1D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xC13FE5B4F2B127FF2FD6424BA01FE45D
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x7A4772D77BF7E95895F75273168B9884
child are thriving."
0x27F1BA0A0639ED8E279C820E7146D040

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0xC467B8CA90E2036E12BBC8DE1D117B2C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0xC8F3F8798280C49D90893C9CCA6F051E
badly at present--in great trouble."
0xCF33580D5B346A21A9A46002FA2D694A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x04EC56314D14E89B834D4D5D299E3171
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0x9A3813ED3681F231944A54F0151454AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xADF4B7FE3433C03B302A68B5AF3F6577

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. John?"
0xFB8B22AEE1B7577AA68DECD7C8502163

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x203F60E12C6FDF57CB10EE1A8170BC4A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x8AC8477A89A4C1F032BABDBC12305DD5
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0xFF4A90C7C360EA97D54B034B47063757
his death was shocking."
0xC95FC734EA37760F3C28C16E60089F94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x825A1683EE602AA6F85ECAD462554643

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0xE4EEB52B884E5E84A2615EF841E5E1F8
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x676A08D127E7E6EADFCFA617F5E21DCE
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x113F8A4570BF8E2A9490B83C87236D05
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0xF6C28A66B3371A5722ACBB1DE1D735C7
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0xE5C0D7B8592E2132488F3C597541241B
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x9C632814EEECA046FFEC2B6A84B6B10B
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x650CAEC987C3162BB1E2EA1D0E63BBA4
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x4C5BA8BD22A719352C5F6648FC131FAE
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x0AF2D3137D1A37C8E1340E7876AB7101

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0xAEB9B142D0F3D449C1E4DCEE29530D25

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0xE326A2C7C9C16501857A013EFA3F8DFD
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0xDF413D23EAC3943ACFAC7E7C42CE2FE1
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x9FA78465C06BA1BB869AA0A3B750E13D
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0x3D71F89FF1D2D2F98C961FFB2D2E7FBD
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x94AB6BCBFB892551BBD4A759542EF61C
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0xDADFA36DC6DC9EBC0E4AAB2B3350A025
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0xCFDA1C24265BC64998ACDCE0659BE8E9
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she

made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0x2D3D6D661494B482E7B971522C7C670C
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x990F1BE95740477F4961897B1C904DDD
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0x055DCCD496A6BD5AC0D253D24BBDAA79
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0x58F7F1721FD82DD9F8F79A125AC4B2BD
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0xEB1DC46DC994B28B1CFD2FFD4F547A2D
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0x2FDE654D9C6544F77E4F72D5CBB8587E
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0xEEDDA7A199BE2BF6A9127C4E53EFC7BB
morning."
0x6FE3B7AB5633F54C7BA0444981BC7777

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xE3479E0D215C82A07F0F483BF1042B08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0x2D1FD961DA7DAC0AC907B88040B7EAE3
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x2D89FB543140D530E4896BB1A0AC453A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x6D08F52B57851193E28EAD8AE8A65978
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0xCBB31A878637409F9A139098EEC89356
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0xD56761272E5AC54E1E0A346709C08BA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x6A62B503CC904A2835D39668FFAA542F
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0x970883F018C4FABAE81BE5A2DF799801
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0xADDEBE53494E150723C03C71333ABEAC
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x9D3EF29F125F17A2745FC0E2CECD0B2C
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x8DD0E9AFDB86EB9FF4DE280A58E7C8EC
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x3414D3F92239F6BB29DFC7F8A45C6BA9
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0x15EC3F5C617AC284307C48BE2006F26B
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0x815B816CED2562B6056D93DFC6D4D7E4
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0xF99E381911210912314EB1730A78080F
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0xB54720F0F4ACF67014CF093A8B52B486
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0x7B0474A10BE9EAC39ACD80DFAC73E1CA
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0xFC7D5FB8C3EE65731B316891C576233B
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0x1DE8EC2D999A2B2D21FB44B2B7C35286
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0xA84F881C9D3A4FE54BAF9107152D8B02
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0x3FF26D7A01590E3862B5F561C81B9382
lineaments.
0x208A123CCD4D7C0FA5753986082FB371

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0xD8A66DFB46CCC8698C01C9515AD58374
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0x16D1FFE5D38496D8EF00BA3EF4FE10E6
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0x513A87447C7F405F8ACCBE43D5CB7840
cue and followed me from the room.
0x23529157B927F983148E94630AAC234C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0x94F70245A7BD291C11F8380CDDF5E138
which he had shut.
0xDB4C01BC63ACF1783BA2FDDA9879FCCE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

had no relations."

off."

0xAA617C58AA617C585B4BC71B70A543D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was

talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
0x3D7C27ABB2A66921A43593FDA744DBBA
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of

daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have

you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
0x8499A596BF262FF89576167760839427
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
0xE44A270FF4F5B20FCF0724BED2ED3871
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
0x69F6BBC838A26BDCEFA865311261E957
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
0xACB7D495683F3A4B5F9CEDDAB0174A78
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
0xB1A470B41A1F45856E40424D0CA4E2D4

0xF48ABC00E05FC38EA7AEDF07B8478249

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
0x573495549D1AB63C421E2AC3B89ABFB6
if recollecting something, he said--
0x426B55F30DE5365FC1BBE74B95AF8F91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay

away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not

"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
0x836454C8A1B29D452D5394631F71D7F6
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
0xED10881602E0234C78363F1560E277FB
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march

0x03D294EC09FFBE8BA0AC293824ADE9E3

you to seek a place, I suppose?"

you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten

"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
0x63DD41466384D71E0CA6C7E2D73432DD
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
0x6268433FA4423D4C9C0CFCAD463720A8
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more

than say Farewell, Jane?"

"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
0x356E49F64550CCD2CEB2AD5DA7CE0A39
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
0xEBC4D8773EDA2A93BBCB0D40401A2849
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
0xD025BCFC3995B4C0558B6DC03A6C961E
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
0xF70A31B7778410114BA802318DD745EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
0xDC07DA694844220F397FEFC3D0BDC3BF
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x9B8CEB1D8598BBF608996F160A877606
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0xED28C8E1ABAD8DEBA3ACEFF5C0333258
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xF7ED2CA6D42371CA35C0E3730041A08E
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xA2E2402B87069A9B6EDBD5845B4B6975
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
0xD585FBAA4F722A4DB6E9E1122B99B654

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
0x48695150552801046F0DF578189A3150

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
0xAE12802D62D0D55C1459FE5D92367E17
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
0x5CAD3D717B0E64656A5F1D0A660E08BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
0x73D021EC7E7E27B0BE465B367230266A
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
0x541B82C26C2CF810B1C8B54D65EB54A1
will finally recover."
0xD8C4FB86E6980D7C049B92D7601DF753

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
0x8F1072C1BB32C433E1524CAB34798649

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
0x3F65A50F2E0E7A3245E2DF9008C78766
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
0x45368378D5B50DFC4A529661D97022E3
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
0x787577DB945798B57BD87274CDA5A5BF
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
0xB825E6E8781C266AECD0D740DDBA3B14
and then I will go up with you?"
0xBD3B14EB294084FCB86262B2A951B47F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
0x4F0FEAA0C34C9DBCBE9A7B419D4BFD4F
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x34BFBF91AF776BA2BA637EBF7AE4D98A
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x3B3ACBF07D774B1C32705D8D1BCF57CF
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0x71C3C402CB9F79295A7D522017BFDECA
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x982754ACA2545377FAFF565191CAB58A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x64F0C9D37E368FB851B6C88FB80B6CC8
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0xFD01321DF360BAF24532D7464A9F1AC8
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0x3413FC4A26D40AF945C6B0E9E1612B5E
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x0039923E62E3756F9AABC8A877F91577
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xD4036A72109F3E5BD07B007667ABF157
looks.
0x1A4099E51A4099E5D0DE19D627B9CDF8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0x9F01795F6539E51B0604E533D833E1EB
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0x5C8FE9AC35BB5C49C50AD6BEA0F9CE7A
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0xA9B9EB1E61213BE6A5E0D9DF3E3D48F3
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0xF11A2424C532634F9838EAB76E9A4DD8
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x6DC1799A04EF92622EF249F21D87C6FE
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0xD36386871D3C552F487C17EAAD711624

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xDD2C774F6D96D067A9D218352991B912
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0xD327A976E1FE9797761187D3F08CDC70
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0xCE26365F778125D9F87C5184AE650498
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x58764B302103A10560B22FC4E256E957
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0xA683CAF5D52425DE0A3535F2D02EA5D3
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0xA3E0E876B6C2380888F2386BA19734C6
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0xB877D8C391E4661C8C6DDC245DD29847

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x3D4B857F854512819920B6F7D5E1D9B4
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x5FB1ED7C1D66E05F9C333091CD7F2EFC
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x81AF95D4D4DB26D9B0758915F34AD05D
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0x0F97E1ADC038E03E65327FE611DE6450
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x74AC66429F8448A92839ED01238DD7B8
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x453DB9A1CE176E57338C26826E4EC931
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0xFC1D8B3AB92A620064D0AD4C32E6729C
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0xEA63080806A93FBF3EE674EA51CCC8B9
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0xB6FB76AB9BFD45988FF9475B84265D08
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x346D2326B89879F1ABB523116C32F948
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xBD59DA85FC73C707926B563F8BE65FCD
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0x340C671EB0C9E9463C9279A79213A9DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0x2A5EA010FF438036250DD3CE32767104
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0xF02E3A62A9B1396564A7CF263222037E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0xA3E9F05B1743E9467388473EFFE6C02B
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xBFF1472249331364C55BC161CF9A636A
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0xF167BF654A5793D86271027B31A8A8C2
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0x3620EDC8A0FD6FA6B07B7F83A57B0DF8
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0xCF8C471774985939AC488F826E2A34BB
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x3BE8E87FB55233940FF50CE9ACEC85F4
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x8B4882DAA7D27C926E8B490C249253E5
past recognition.
0xDA72BE82CBAC8744E3CF973F645EFD56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xE37B4E67EB47C854408824CB7A53E653
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0xB095A212D8604AB3D6EF251827C35797
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xDED14BBA9B16EDF226E96EE6D362066A
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x0ABAD54DAECFB8ED389B8AD0EC213815
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0xAEAD8A2E83399A4E76BEC6CB29E3C7F0
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0x8BEBCFADF1ACF13DBDABE36F799A85AE
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0xA87E15D4707D8D4CA7E40424FB020CB6
colourless visage.
0x0E9EFBE67381F5C57DC64D3BC798A688

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0x0BD1278284C426AD034FEC027E57180D
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x3DA76B6F0CBDCAD05887B1FBA92F842F
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0x7A8F63032C489E422A635230A5F31D33
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x985E29DECED4E27900A48FB431BFE35B
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0xE6DDE72E9465D5E6B86487808ABCDFC6
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x890DAA03271ACF1AAFC7B954013CABE7
other's looked puritanical.
0x5280E3CACB135986AAB7A4A657E2BD49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xA22D0F72945CB56112E8B3D5D0E422C8
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0xA4131AA808335B957D3BC147AEBC0F4F
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xB7E4C161AD2EB5BB523D9D38DD07C41A
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x3F12EB8E0D4AC03CEDF159630A60826B
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x8B565FE15C5926B8A25295C3072A1B47

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0xC7A756EADDB74178BE2EAE898D201C63
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0x1CC59EB9B0D54B976E80318CA4A4DC42
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0xCB827B156374B03E9FA4223C490AC49D
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0xB8A14CEB332DE2B52F4298FC78B3E88A
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x7C0517F4C67784285A998946FC0C98FD
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0xF9804FDB9EBAED957C209B897D6580D9
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0x988209516D242C0CC09AC11672049099
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0x1DDEDA3F4080F06D520967D15D062FE1
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xDF8CB0AA6BB9495DA36AA640C914B6C6
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0xF207AB838BB899F8AB6EC710D20ADD8A
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0x19A1512CE53E7611206ACABE9D52AFDE
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xDAF77DF9BDF27D3077AF2CE636728D99
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x38F70530B2C8D26276831CFC5BD366F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x44BCD6FF872E931630907095F118FA12
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x1A10C6A037A62F873807F85C0E9AC9D1
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0x8DD4074B8F18CD06AC9FB0F35C2AE9C3
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0xF6BD38E08D7C843CA3FBA9A6DA7FE265
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x6FF2251CD343A71BB1D4AD172BD4B120
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0xE5A87D54B10B6E7CF5551B2E4E8AEF26
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x4FB6C9A337527DF6091D16828AC72C7F
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x89DBF7BC60ED1D11E2EC7845102A872A
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x64FB4DC55A22F94A942C62E69E3486A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0xE140ED17BF567923B0AD857C1643A892
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected

"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x44FB69F4C147B5BF58A95841FF2672D4
can see her to-night."
0xD6EAD5BD3DE15B19BD603125B5409D37

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x6DC1ECA62DDAB8DD56CA05E605249D24
should be much obliged to you."
0x56C600696975613A6F95A4CF4629BDEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x2BBCBED2CDC8E2A09FE63132379722F2
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x33F63861C8900D88FD448EE15A669B99
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0x32CA5BF00FF054E1A2498C46E34DA85B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0x9B1751A95602B323656C61BC30C95CCA
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0x86F52333617EC7A22BDD1394AAEFDE4A
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0xD3B915B63FA556EA46D0097649FFE8D1
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0x43C22D5DFB9977E76CBD6657E5C251D4
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0xBDE235147046E4CF757D8C6992635830
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0xCBB6198FE0587544A0F601F8288CA607
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x92E33F581DF7993244764DEE546380F0
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x1B7820B7B272437984918AA7519F26E3
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0x693D45A6662138DE0D329FD3DC9024DC
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0x482B76E693D6126BF3779A02A193B46A
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0x2A2C1D4791A9C9C6FF5A456A495EA1C0
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0x744417E6087FD82A99B291445E333378
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x3028EEF3A48B72D0C5F4A0484C394512
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x24897602E4E07C1205B116804271F549
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0xDEADC727C99C704E09F0281A09D68DDE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0xF5C4EBF098C1FD2A8E57362C230ACA88
us see if she will know you."
0x2C219B1CBC2F2E4EF7017298206635C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0x9555927E28145E95AD978C05151D0871
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0x5B652E18A281943ED7C21FEDB9AA29E4
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0x7B2C10F9105FD5A7368AB5C8898CBB60
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x3D58F73B516646E5F15CCE31899B2E4F
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x56CD7AA953645F5F93E76AA4E1AA2542
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0xE6805FEF52CE724C6A0D65E37AF5B812
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x737222186FA0FEC9713E6B99CB6A2304
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x32DAAE86E78B03A4D899CFC0F1A1970D
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x53214A5162A8B84FA9950993849882E9
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0xDFB09046D68FDDF658F3E1C6C191B998
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0xD5EE7F6234869C023699843DE43996BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x79CD0E0C75A863A7D584E2E37DE91E9B
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0x74A1B5449FEEE66EF92F6DEB8188B191
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xA12F5AC15E20EE35F4C6D9252E03FE61
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0xAE801C65C37ABA9A4D0A46170F5499C8
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0x0918FCE4EA3A7EEA11D20AC9203C23E2
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0x484C030628B483F51AD5A14222D31B38
amity.
0xD222190AD222190AFE2DD01910B34423

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0x6DF243F9608F67F056E65452CC85A446
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0x791C46E1E7A3FD201D4FA6BCAE5BE61D
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x9DA1927CF8D6C992ED1DBC2DE8DBF5DD
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x65AE215CED3FD13646B5C1F730DEB614
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x665B57193C0CA2935EDE3600E13E75DF
she looked at me.
0x47720D61773340C53B7F93C50718DD5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0x3BA754AF9302B2515A55034E8AC72DC0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0xB64DAEBE277C711B15C62C84C1EF7E50

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x1E8D1500E1FD7AACE9D577DA1D5CBDA8
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0x3ECF5054E50867F03D89E2AAE3E3F3EE
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0x1F2BF986AD6C118F6D7AE92BFDEC8BB6
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0xFE9CB782AE2CA28671CC28E8B4B335A6
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0xEDC1AD9C23CBD28B022C06E66856FA70
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x625FDE91F3D3F102D64951345A436B15
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0xD81BB5286E14FFFDAEDC506011FE0349
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x4394706B0725E2DD6EEEBFBFCE7A2C99
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0x92881F7B036822DEC085A894C35B9613
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0x9A020AB24576D9DCAA68E2BA6EA49B10
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0xDEE85364966523AB74A1F912CA385A2A
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0xFA5D3D7375D8C4E7748433999156ECF9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xC08242B96F6DBBA894E19FA9EE07880D
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0x1707860D5E1266C6B62A7B7667E16C67
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0xA76ED36A45EAF61AFC855C8C9D6C8257
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x50B897C947A01AD15C810BA83246E97D
the pillow.
0x4FCB7201337B784AD71B5977BCC28871

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xA2E07AEC4CAC3B9E2AA4CF73BDC2AAC9
till I see how you get on."
0x418493ED6644D43C66CD82F6872FC299

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0x8D1E62026FA6BBD7FD62DC34773399E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0x5D9F69A48916D36495E5E947DF4D482C
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x9DF8987F7DE28801CE263733B50509FD
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0xE45E1A9AEE131D2261CFAEF80A01AB57
say--let me see--"
0x5FBE423732BAF2042D67B412D65C048D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x0F80C052DB70A841D49253E614CE40E3
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0xC5402624808EF36AFDA97E8004EBB58E
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x640F7B4C896BC30C1B6A58FEE818A892
was at once irritated.
0x22F8B6E58D87529562AF36DAF19E16BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x76FBEA8F3CE08CC748883EFBC201F9A2
you Jane Eyre?"
0x33B00CC4E8E46060F07BBBFCA9665519

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am Jane Eyre."
0xCB119D91037BFF9E4B9C85956454B604

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0x149D135355D1B2EDD0BB51F4B0EBB2C3
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0x191A31ED9828D8B0300199F39BDA7633
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0xADEA319A71494EB9D43884DC274A040D
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0xCFE6D9AA50D33E4CF5C6EDE99E47C87F
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0xBA07A7177FD3892FC4000CD359FFC33A
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x592BCF9D7CBE6F32431AF49E6BC9CD1B
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0x4DCB339425262FD838767C5CFDB2357C
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x974D900E9D0712E2D735DE7CBD2F7A93
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x603B74D074D6D4B62B4F379FA9D6C9E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x7656DF366B8002B52A8DF6E78D0A1487

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x38B26825B269E928E478F75031343256
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x70D56505C7B2CA975CF214BC18B6930B
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0xED12451A6FE566DC54579FA0A0BE406C
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0xD3E0B544F8550F3EA701259B8918683D
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x2FE0B41D361F4B2229062C0A597DEC17
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x80C2A0FB920D9B6158FC18C756285273
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0x089AA0AEBDE68677662567FEC5A2C0EA
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0xD6AC055E245BCC03434997701AC1B574
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x0BB7FAE918E2F70A9A50F3DD49040A5E
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0xC8E73A68D280BCB37693004DD00DE622
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0x9E3D0E72EE1881698CE0913EB394BA45
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0xFF5B6318CCA9C2DFDF51DD66B9854F88
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0xAFCC42061CDD07E05EBC575E2A8ADF66
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x639ABB4AF554CAEBBD4DE5189A093FA0
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0xFB90DEDAE36DEF049C155CA11CE692BC
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xCBB95D2479FFF377A1E61DB21B807590
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0x7D7C35806C2FBD167818CD1ABBF5E71B
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0xB5FD676199C24FD2D4B1EC18AC321406
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0x76AED050690C8B433220A2E953934B6E
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x9BC3DF757905A3B474A96BA4B19BE57E
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x66FA5B4E4064CAB5D6F48287BAFCAE8E
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0xDFDC3D04DCFB1E9F89B0EE53AA771BA2
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0xB26FFFC35DCC4ED2709F0AAC2F0AF99F
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0x65F7CE8B0CEC14865E95154C74F448E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0xA55D20172F700B3A37E46465CBB87140
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0xB348692E69287E0B3CBA9055BA077DA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0xCF77AC38A050B1895DBAE463EE86E661
the morning she is calmer."
0x7F200A547883213EC244092DEC4A59D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0x578C01DAF3806B6AA038B6B460D53A14
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x97ECABF201DD119872353BD215B4F40D
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0xA995A491E0A9EDBD325BD288FA37289F
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0x2AD41E28BD431AF0AEE677E714E9AF27
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0xC13D40E720CF4DB544E5DFE48FCF786B
had?"
0x771AEAF4771AEAF44C4EF7EEFC84E44E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0xD3AD08FA7545CBCFB77AA574E91A5F57
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0x5C52DE7A5368B4C588C0B99A8DC60721
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0x8313A2217323931FC25498F36353B19E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xA3B32A4A513032FD7C1606F981AB26EF
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xA7EA48DAF1160ADDA93F23BC00BD5A0A
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x0B6FF826817278841F0E7409DC2671B5
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0xDBBDDD8B99F5A59F49907E91C111F702
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xC48D8BDE1080F5A90CD97C1896045209
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0x90969ACC833F5A05BCF0E8B649C18B36
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0xD768B98795A5978DA36C27C6DCFCD116
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x873C53407AC4FBBB426DA78C0DF02487
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0x78B0962D405FD3BB52E13E33BCCD4BCA
for both.
0xDB63EB3DE487CD767CEA1572565CD0DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0xDD0C17DA564907905E8D33AB170A6F52
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0x24330BC3B43FB2D9929A31F8AA41EC36
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0x1BA0DE6C6A256250B2DA198BBEBC1837
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0xBDB36FA41094E6DCD6799C9765478495
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0xA86651F4C3563BEEF45CC96636E5BB90
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x543C038407048A35D78EB6C11CF0BA71
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0xFDC28A6BF5989ECE1476D9DBB7853296
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0x00CDF15482E355C597307410D93F8244
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0x86C3F7240A6D6BDBB4DF5C29645F430C
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0xFD8451E7E923CCD190DF71BC87F6AD61
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x34C6D72503E5E3F93B9E4B1A7EE4A8D9
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0x855E1D0D79893217AE7323E7F2E9522B
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0x804BD82F15CA4442A8AE510614383D49
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x2EE3B7403811FE7B6795D378A906314C
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0x96A8F8AEEAFE32047FAE3DCB633AF842
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0xB51EB02185F7C6B4E39EFD6409056E76
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x3561F0E78F05ABD5EB192FF3D584147B
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x2AAE3793AE0C95308F2F4DD03A60D9F3
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0xE9C537925CB61DFCF5BFCB2A4DFE4687
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xEEA7140C67E05C6B7679942C3218582E
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x5DC859FEC2999302FD0AAE33198E0586
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x90492D96B0F7C9E27931AA307344F10F
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xA14F47A811BA85B5431451F927C421B8
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0x364616F13EDFC5E6EB8F1B42D68A589D
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0x894DB985551DACF46171B97F5DFBEA7E
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0xB83BD34B06972016DBDB338AC41A42FE
and content.
0x30B542BFD61212FBCFEE91B9F64EC0C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0x6734D3F124A871D242B2AB0DBD0A0FA1
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xF27F7912A95AB47698503A34286EECC6
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0x5851E5FD2E09C25DE072C193363CF9EC
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x98F1404E6F4824B256A465800F1873B3
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x4CE86518B7FCF7216FBCC41D65DB082A
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x9DAECF02FCBBC3BCEC280A1941A819B9
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0x6ADED4F6F706BA93D4947E3405F1AC00
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0x6EDA4C3C80591700B6F82E765E894340
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x1491870E029DBDD9AB2CF5EB93DECDE7
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0x36C1183F28F18FBDC0049DC6903EE267
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0x8DC82DC960DA89A939BDD086560C7637
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0x1B38187967DD58CBD61612B00ADBB935
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0x5E5B6B4CBC05ED3964E38FAF9706E07A
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x1EC49E4FB2C39647CDA709EAFE626D2B
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x720A64B55F44918A3E3C0EF3DBBAF8AE
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0x1F6F9234A6C7D125AE81AE3C60CB6769
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x83070D6542A36242F5562356A2365826
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xED92CC4374D9B23F87E39D4225582F0F
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x5DA1924D0CE9E016CD077FA198B193A8
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0x5C97B0438725EF7A70BEEAB2D2AA2880
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x916DF3244C63616962FE1CC5DFD81CD8
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x9536FC81C9904C8C3369E20D46E82365
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xEC6ECE8DC3CC28F36F2A6A3C6773A0CC
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x20E920DB314F61B8CDAC58F6BAEE3DD2
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0xE31ACDC4C85C3AA914B1D0607BCF9813

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0xA56E27A5AEF8836E062E8127EDFD75AA
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0x30B7C53DAA8BE071B0A706891B9FFF47
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xEB6D65CC8BBDF4445EC6651ED197C3CA
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x8FED17C9B5DBE351689EABBE8EEBC2C0
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xEEA587CEA2EBBCB5BCA9E07DBEA78218
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x2B9BD03E3F4B205EBA7362B67D906393
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x8D3394809D52EC2723C46B5367FF6DC8
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xB25D49E22E2BE6C9079153D4719CDD31
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0x5916C1A5A86CC87DFF6BA002CF73E2B5
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x1F9A6F635456F7EED29FB3683F27C450
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0x5ACD4D1F46836F5F28757D0BED4DC5E3
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x770B8F96E04BE8F6BF546E56A67C0932
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0xD1C7E50A7986A9DD7D27B4E2F6C6CF27
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0xA61A7C36877E49E49FB405C7557C8E7F
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0xD3185B3F8A06DF3872DC0C46AA137329
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x5079CCE2B07EB6A1D2C33F629F44EABF
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0x58837B7169ED0D36B3BC9D5A38A33789
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x4B05968A1515ADD9026566CA3B968C82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0x10BE1BF3FE5B482EEF548A4FB49C7A13
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x222488BC482FC8729844CA5EEBCE1C8F
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x65DBF1259D4F3001A3D9F07CBF989647
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0x9F2E3E97BFC146CBC6CD45D8F3A6FF86
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0x60121E3179B92F0E57782E47D1342399
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0xE0092E3C7390311033C3B6ABC30A6A08
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0x7E274D7354AC76F4EC8829C9199C4573
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0xCC69C58BDE4963B9A723D225ECB42C0E
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x600844ADAD1862B91501691E73FEDBD3
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0xA7B8D23CB7C4BD45D4A75567A170A0CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x0976AB82B40ECB77F0482D412187E3FB
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0x5376EFFE4EF103D59225793892686E6A
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0xA2128C52096AF56668091C7FB4206E84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0xBA5EC86D166B9776D09E47306DABC83F
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xA37A4DAA3155BF6C363DB0E0B9749E41
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0x0B9E7D83486338B25E31FD8291995355
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x774FB909B3E526F5AB3D699F93ECFA0B
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x901FBC74230A49D43827CF5C4CF9FAED
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0x2FF458DC792FF4ADFD0DFF85183BBDD1
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0xEFEB9E20BD283AC1FFD0514949474B34
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0xE1DC53F8A5D6DDDA3ACBD8D642F2D829
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0x990D58D790DD2C98FD32F8BB7111E801
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x18837F971605B414A616E033CC43CF6F
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0xD6E32C988203174F8C5CCFFFA2C4CE75

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0x3B408933D79D69441453ED8B2537B57A
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x0130DAA1C7DB0368B5E1C8B7089CA7BB
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x3C54775E82B9E365C86D562C387099BB
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0x38DA5821B98A367D27CCD249B64FDFF7
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x9CE672ADA97D02B6BB90D3DD98A3FD48
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x1DF86D53159069B9F7AF8D65CAE584A7
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0x0C8AC8F70E8BBCA4AC7737A78000B066
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0x09FBC047338AEDA6D9EFBAC71B4D65BA
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x6F820C6393BFD056C7863CFBB21C5296
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x12E9F01A966C0E28541D0BDCA9975D8F
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0x9D7410C1AB0BB7271E24735D95A7BB71
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x8B8A6918EF0E4B99A6CFE37E68131DA7
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0x4D7C68C48B1D3282CDC5A850EC533E3E
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0xCBA90328C18413C03BC7AAC955AC9869
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x7E211ABE42CA2CE049E78726DCC0A63E
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x0431634F5A770470866A386530E90FB8
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0xEB1F2A5EE0574B9582A2373A3FDE1562
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x381F562FB5A7246A3D623CED1799C7E6
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0xCED674487E36C143E5904D7A421F0462
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0xEFFD307A0E74EA58DC538EE3A69AE248
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xB2B13A672251D6BF4B860A47E2C5CE9A
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0xA71A10D0BEA5E6A5C3CF5033A6FE1023
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0xEF77040C58E3DDC2C2D225C22F90BD2E
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x7987472F04187DE376D63A6EF48FB757
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x3EA995B5F84CFBEF54705EC2B9FF812E
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0xE2C8D7E86C08C5C1EACCAC31D6115DE3
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x39B0DF90AA022E25FE226BFC73B8CCB2
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x0F84A7DACBF63CC2DC71B03031941DC9
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0xB50A19AD8E3744CFF30267A7EB69D1E1
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0xD3A91CB03641E88C42102B6418825488
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0xBBA566FEB2E09A70490F3BDF424C33EB
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0xC5EA9C3C8084F7A5C1C27818C9B50900

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She closed her lips.
0x1F2E65D382F443395EC0D9717ADF3BEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x13889E5E0A8CF6D1C6617FEEC0D219AC
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x0EE1AD884ED27F48A9DB6E5A1A989CB9
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x615A2A24003F94517BA29A18215923A2
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x799BBC0C668D323723968C653A3BA31B
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x0037E2AECFE499E4A8B495CAA72AD5D9
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0xC23B117C5E0FF13D3356A8CC42ED73DE
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0x65E842B21CE42A978089CD5F18283247
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0x32ABDE43135C3A17AD4379006E8E8A16
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0xABC01C803D8C7E047AA800221071D9F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0xE7AC7482A396BC0275C43714BA00DDAC
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x89EFE5A1B58B7BE5CC6FD20155F44947
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0xC1398D8E4269AF6549412847B2D78E6B
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0xCE9F5FD2379749C583DF19312452545F
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0xA8C518BCA8E4CEE46C7789E5546FBC55

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0xD60EC556E3832390FE4F446437BC252F
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x64CBA50CCBB7207496409AAF433E40DA
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0xE0478A97F03FC7DADE03B6CA339DD35D
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x395016F5E95A4A4899A87CBCCDC34018
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0xF65BF99656D238CAE9220E463DA9BDCD
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0xC6D167A4DBE35DA2D1362045488A732E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0xFA9CBF1A8728F911DF148BD48DD1083B
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0x0DEBD63FBA010EC6A638C315857F04CF
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0x3C68702CCD88276E4E1DD3454101CF58
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x5D8A8FC4CE1DE2D0A5918B7D2E0BC339
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x98DD805AEC53773DFF5813392A615C6E
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x3A9ABD73594DD9277F7197C5373F51AC
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x223BB1AF50810A35D8C8C9A475016156
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0x30C7E6AAC2E6C4862D3B4B519E1693DC
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0x23C9C27C8AC8CF9253D2B9F93646182A
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0x83AFC9AC966C8C35E6D46FD241591470

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:

"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x0E278B41ECA7EFB6437ED48BE29AED70
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xB02A197ED278BAC56B4A35B9ADA12344
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0xDB24231AD0AF85358AB894AACF3BC527

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0xCA63664F35347FD9E197353A8CE6FE5F
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0x0BFC07FF5E0A2F780CBF3334E7B00B36
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x773263E95B144F4B8176B32477A4B255
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x80F950D53E76A9B706D95DE8E0BBB41F
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x40859E6A2F2E8DAA5F5E0E6815B089C5
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x0558CB096F0B4CB171478304D90CB401
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0x54D77AE8DDA7551FBFDCCA0771292E49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x92A05B4395A0A9089AADEAF28635B71D
her.
0xE8E0FB75E8E0FB75EF9EC667E0B46033

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0x67EA3177FF876DD39BB7E3B95CB0400A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0x5CB08AF587FB9E17A2DE79FD862B55F1
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x75A8DF50DE51008B94CF7A89646E7389
me--where is Bessie?"
0x57EC6B27E1E1A78447385CC7BB28B494

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x0E54C10CB5E5240118CA667021D66D29

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xC01CD852934588E53FBCD7365EDCBD7F
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x8AF472CA35CCA207FC833CD04F60D5BE
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0x9B01AA0BF7428DDD50701C5123C20FFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0xF5B2CFBA65A517D37C9894266DBBEB84
identity.
0xE8486BA661B6650166665F9D4E1C383C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0x7116DE9D4E0C63AA6D2B68BC4D7B58B1
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x25E91633737EBBF57C440C4D6A4B3BBC
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x249343A794D7F04C569E70247CA7B6B5
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x10634865037826A0E16635DF06FD09A6
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0xC6BFC03C5EFE6084309582B12E46B39D
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0xACFECAC7DBD178E8B05E7CE194A8498B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x1EDEBFE4D89EB09F3CFA3D1EF9A01777
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xDAB3FE4A048CB26BD84B705354FB0DEA
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0xFFDEC1C3A69F5E624FB35C48191AB230
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0x8D198BC198DF91D11BDCA81F871C8D00
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0x43A6C05257F453BF253FB04B9BD557FB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I assured her we were alone.
0x41CAB1ABBC5F289C22910A75FE6DCDA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xA5FCF91CB23C833ADB7463B2E5407CA8
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0xB11E1B6634E7250C5564C61F689312DA
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0xC94F238A5ECFE05D99D99711BB3712FF
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x0114023579FE8BBA92E119DFB9E4B774
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0xB5F26C82259DE54F44FCBF5106274109

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0x75D2C0DDBE9FBE2AB2CC6A3631B091D2
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0x1D8982ADE8FE4DAC4BA82CE855BB157F
of the last pang.
0xB061518E9C6E6FD3C2D0E2AA0C12F202

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0xCB329D2A1FB0413C931894CA0AEE28E9
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x5E75B3C47CBF5F05A6990B565E0595D4
there."
0xBE345460BE345460B83BD8588CE6167E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xB0757B7822E479C619E8EC17005F7C20

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0x8E4035F09E3FD4B663D85110DEC1F31A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my

   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x9AEA233DED10305CE4E294E5F116B3B7
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0xCA52C5AA3A6A52AD2584E292D8BF175D
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x2B7CAC57288290C8C77A8C89C0B42780
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x881B1D7EB331FD8AD2BBCC124ABE2CB1
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x6696727F1C23366F1D78A356CB69E4DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was dated three years back.
0xAFD44AE7C5C7C28AADC6896D2FF59215

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x87A52C617DC26636E8ACF4A2FAFC3712

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0xECB677E24D72F4030C3B75F7AFF11AC1
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0xF7688B03B8EAEF65A24107FACB09C2EC
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x84699B15008ED25E25312A23763E9128
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0x21D0C2E8FC34B4C21EDCAC63C0B19866
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x5053CAF34A90A3D93F54C58DBE6A7237
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x2BCBF6B2EE22367DE5420DCFDD648E66
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x31EE99B790C9E756B9848A340DA04BA0
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x907BD01C6608C38DB7A5C193A061171F
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x9458CD0192124E2853B3E3D873B324E7
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x22EF77088DE6E7D554589C7BF076FDB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0x1BC22201DFCDEF8ACC42301C6AD8A84F
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0xB2DC6C6926036AE8C11257593D1ED0DB
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x1F3B637460D05C157FF14AD3BBE70708
passed since that day."
0x9BDD47880F459B86C2A294337E9B47D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0xD2D39594AEE80F016F71A77C2E0FE038
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0x4C6AB72FB9768F71C495A232D7801BD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0xBBBF305A33F2893ED77ACB676ADC796C
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0x1081A424AF19F13C657F30806F08863E
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0x6F4B27806783F5922066A582AC095E1E
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0xB9A3AC69A155080212140E906E73F6D1
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0x9154452375B4FF4F732F448D75CDA6B4
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0x22E53724637FDDC4961068D72DB941E6
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x0CF39D0FE06BA5943F0ED04D58DC0918
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x156FD9E11B9E2F8F4D02F48AF520ED41

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0xBAE91048AC56090D62F455DCF650D6D1
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0x66420ABA695B7AF571FD7035F561F837

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0xE823B17B292225845B1EDF077A2525A2
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xB02BE589723F6661F50D4E7936535392
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x5812D8CEB8E2578D280622FC008BF33A
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x440F655449DD11B6940C8C6423A8601B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x02F4C161164ACB661443A122FAC149C9
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0x6012F925964FB573CDD9508064DE09C0
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0xB7ACD9D985C0C73563B1082E12093085
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x2EBB1DE6BCB54E20F0DAA2522EB694D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0xE8873E6C1D0D4B953FEF5CAAB656F510
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x5AE09D0A3A2536C43CA82D175C8861A2
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x4F66A04FB0D9596FCC9107E780DA9A4F
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0xAE044A92B1E3F07CE011C34A8B81942E
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0x6180BB3A906262476012EC3BDAD613ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0xD616B0B25E1568FC8C9BC89BEB26AA78
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0xFFFFC63A69E6E92B29C92ECB78429A3E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0x7FB720ECA7B7D89849F4876E1A42C283
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0x69E64685CE9BDB3CCCACE754D2035A88
she must hate me still.
0xCA77C5299048A1D3792064B1E36A44E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0xE558359820DD4F659D10B71DBA89BBBB
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0x357D853AEF42A26D9EF6619349F4574D
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xC2EFE34043E0E2AABEC13950B871BF6B
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x1AC8E3822F67DCF3CF22A90C242BE137
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0x1E4B63FBD84BF065E8692CBE4578E881
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x27B5F0942C5E7F3EF80484C38AFEFB50
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0xD130E917126ACE6960F59A0E238395CB
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xDCE12B5C119B9569B4D62136DAC20E60
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x51734BB03E7160AB37B64961F92BF9C2
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0x516E4D19C38185394DAFA6941FCB2D24
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0x804CEF7EADD1127D7674F875F4129ACC
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x0748F0764F146C7D28665D4596B9FE7F
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x0A16B412E34AF2D2D7F0FA04EA42B283
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x9D74D5A7821CDAF8A074AE30CD1E0D9B
form.
0x58C6A8AA58C6A8AA5E012ED1ADAD317C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0xE6F4028F5C7E17B09864D7DB3E57E020
observed--
0xE71D63564ED8FE375290FDD213F811BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0x896907D7290290CC847BD1A8837030FE
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0xA2292318EDFA34704620A32C367BA592
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0xD569D9D08C25FC491151BAF88B31398F
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0xE60E763387B812805B5DE20EA3D615F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0x05725DD7E1DCE35AE38EC20473B9E56E
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0x5842E1089A99DA7A032A32BA94CDA169
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x45FC42CBF6944074436ED4CDFF136629
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x4ADC4B17ED4646F152E680FFA3666B57
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0xAF456C404E2452F270A5F62AD980EE6A
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0xD16F0A9C54EBE86E215AD9241770711D
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x8A4080164FF8AD0802AA3E2D56184BE9
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0x9B6E0424B4C26FFE272622D65F149331
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0xF8C5501118B24A1C488BF7B5861C2768
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0xBC68F46D93A3CFDED3E9DFDE5ED8CBD6
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x7FA7A1B80AF307CEF8915EEA3FFEA41F
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0xE641DBFA6DC46467FEE1850CD486C21F
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0x7E49035C01CF14E417976F9FB51AC899
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x070B4A00C571108E03E1692B8510F0ED
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x3EE70D02251103D3ED04539D05B56835
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0x0280571CC92A44AB9F9C8D4D1087C469
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0xA8E35A339305D183D0E11943C95C81B9
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x901293FBA0900B388AE2FDA055AB1EFA
patient and compliant on my part."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x311F7972D10901224A90EBB19F8C1AB2
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0x1E9ACB377A193CE2695DD9AF95E78024
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0xD4CA7FF82DAE373C01EEBDA5CD07E724
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0xF2FEBBDBF24E5C23238909DB30774172
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0x3C1C2D188BB6CB8D4A7A7BB2A2CA0C3F
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x7A5D471439D4E58E43269DD7748268B4
notes of condolence.
0x05FC64A81ED7AC92AC20019F616B032C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xC3B29495590452B5779A5B5D2213BBAD
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0xD9BB6F5A579CF96676A9C1D3C60EEDE9
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0x8C110DA8B0544D7FB9202F9AE38C159E
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0xFB431111044459A3C08841C7E1E6B5BD
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x155F7E2D06C0B08D0E958F92BD4BFF7C
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x5A44B9CCEBCC5E9086FD4E248D0CDF7A
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x19DD13F61A37D8F745EC08235345F037
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0xB3E42D715BFDBA422029400CD42BBD4C
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0x25578811604DA6B93B0B7DD52F1339E1
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0x1F83509C7EE6578C5428E72C81A57997
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x9133C5F980B0E58C438DD024FBA1F914
veil."
0x07721B0E07721B0E94DF9B74764163BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x1EB78C515BC3E98063297DD9AEB5D42C
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0x7A288E4E2464FE140850250DCFF2936B
good may it do you!"
0xA9A1152AA8DB2EAB839D3A135FC5353B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x9E9BC890A76312CBDA548E5FBAF0EE5B
you have some sense."
0x5D592DBD36E178EA9CC5FCC1F06B44FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x73A7E261E861C562B2AC8AEF5D759E8A
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x7054ABCE7DC98EAA6564C7F34900A568
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xB23947014A409EF5638A88078FB201ED
much care."
0xE2EFDD92F749486BF87F1616916AB5A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0x3D29733F06D880D3E50DFB702C40E001
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x543EAED048285E96959977DC52D60D8B
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0x1CF9071CA15E525EF873F26DDF14EAD7
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0xD7B8DD18672C5FB40B1547B43BF9B339
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x72EA48D4391D71A5776233BE1E625F73
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x5FA7AE51BC82924F4BC714D2E0B93730
fortune.
0xC221A4898AD2ACF5431126BC5F011068

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0xD8A0057BD4E9385886F9991076D1073E
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x3A9EB37F4F6641FB25D206604B230AD5
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0x671CFA5D2C6970BEE2E624B49EC12A9F
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0xB593DB82A05033AC5968111543660A29
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xA3D948E076F9D9E3EB29D809B97C9554
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xE59D77EE3535B6035BFFC08034A03F9E
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0xE6AB4452B4FACF061EE0D65F420F431F
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x89C62818996A30C937D080F0CA81BB16
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x495059BAFCBF2D103A4D43EDE208D4F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0xBB944A7279F288107FF2ABEA257E2DC8
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x1E31E3D952AE33B1B465D56B1F9556A9
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0xAE237EC08918B5653166A50BAD83FEFF
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xD701EBD21167F1034150934A5D747059
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x0A679035FD716CBC186ECB405B12ABCC
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0x7EB053E64D6D218A31F3CD910B78867D
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0xD12F8066158CD0E2CE849277691575F1
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x2B57EA9D106FDD5CD56A56F96315FF63
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0xD27B860A65FA3ABB5FAC591DDFFA7087
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0xBF424B63020BB1D1232C6F966CDA0EF7
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xD0A8BE365EFF6FF7613520D1B4AE16A3
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0xEE87B8DCB672CBDB8327246022D8B6D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0x3B475A95C1BD17F1904D20D5F4E00CD8
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0xAF898EEA0E0474C06201603A865991D5
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xF8D3FB935D28BBD8B4D55723F7A21E26
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x09EE88F8C2171BADBBE08A0BA656C62C
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x4C94D6539E7334969707974D9865AC04
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0x178B915C96B9976C59DBF96873029F45
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xD20F496662D51DF8B6D23FCDB9079425
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0x92D2B16E6484D5361898AE77B257085E
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x474B33B216D014EA8FE4CD2210A98019
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x902F9195B6506CE59AA70E74B03A1FF6
don't doubt it."
0x81E2AD886ABFA74329C439838B429037

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x8CDA381776A6798C935568E26882F849
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0xBFE0750B7CE5FD93B18E07905DF82A70
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0x8FCBEA501EB1395B6CFA7726035BB549
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xABA27D9DD5315001106E6CB9617598D5
both her and me.
0x04A9741FDA1E1E9CA1BCD2F49328B682

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0xD88D50EB75F82724D12105AE5CF0268D
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0x2446C134D6D3DAFB71CFDB803794F8C1
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0x171F399B68D4D27B0D47FCEBCD1246D9
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0x00037527519D88406A8799067F106506
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x26CDB4DB516320F1C97C977328364CC1
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x7E40CB2CEC94AEBEECF1F67CB6706A99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0xF9733D6BE6A9D384042AD71F8D55CC8C
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x0AD0147E3861A256ABD292A8DE3977DF
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0xAA39545361C81DE8EDE5ABAC5A757AE5
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0xDA7C9AF08FFDB46B1181854272973EE2
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x7E6529260F3E526103C33783CD3DCBEA
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0xBB75F9EA1C2B1590A40C5F310897C3FD
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xDB67889F0B18B21D4390A06E1873D746

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0xA0022CC2D91B62C757AAF1A9522EDB97
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x8E364B2C2D945F6696CE9C53F39D158D
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0x6343E542DB84B696A1248429415B20BB
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0xFCFF4C85B998A89720A2BF5C8E6BD3A7
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xAE78D0CCCBA657F787B491A6E42138A7
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x3B26063BC3FE17575D9C041E57181246
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0xBD59C66A79DBE0170EE64EA21674934B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x82B677DEE6AB2C2858A2ED2BCC93F9F3
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x02A3BF69823C198E9216F997B2A28467
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xED8CFF9A23695AB32585DAD62CFB0094
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x2C92E1E6DAD05F5CD9EE0180C934276D
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xF3E5C235E2D644A0474C83ABA0F965D4
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0xC3B27FB3ACAC2D8CE026D7CAAEF66DCD
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0xD77E3BCB2439712FEDAE25CC91CA9B86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0x2CECEEF0F9A512AFC86CC1A7ECCFD351
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x5D200A24EA8AF2587CDC5A4BC5D79651
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x8C23F28F926425ADE79E89D068D17E5D
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x180F5C7ADEAC50AE1099DD1675EFC2CB
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0x146904B0F844782C5A92F1F5E5BA74E9
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0x81F2F336FFB225B8F6FCD535425C8435
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x5183E0871E8020422F496D906CD19808
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x495BB1A611A19213CB0D1EB088D6BA22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x5F68E552260DAD8CC2788E9CE48E89E9
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x0E6DE40E9615BD5294AAC17081CAF61E
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x6777F2D5C0A77EE723035CED8198309E
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0x7C55A3B9A7F02E7DE4E0E105E70E89BB
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xEAB09F9F8C65300377454D109DE22E46
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x35588B8DA760BE38A05F75ECB31B5D89

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0xB300A5CF2BC209D4F3DAF3D54F4EE529
are!  Come on, if you please."
0xCE572FE13362B9841A7A9C77350956D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0x90E74F37086FFEBE818B521C496F163C
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x15E7C4C5DAB9D80AE313858D2B41C325
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0x69904C52EEB50E68E0C01875770E8D12
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x892D490F012AF753BA84E49A0C5895D7
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x05DB2618CB64FCEC41CB9C2ADC894BDA
behave with decent composure.
0xFB1AD8114F81F9FC08CB4D2E677F44F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x4A5158DF3B28E82E1D1E36E2BC302B4E
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0xFE8F7764815AE0A8347FBBADC2A709CB
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x195CDB1B0855AFEE95BD9184EB071CF7
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xEC8CBDA524500D9323B89E49F963DA6B
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0xC097CDE3DD5F6CF4518CD33903C9680F
month?"
0x198B42FA198B42FAE1F7E62185627DB0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x7070B43FEF25C2831B7BBB1C81D0E9F0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x233C57C52D67C3A756969C5117811B18
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x2E6017D72CAC96FAECF2F519F2FF810F
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x050849AA1556E4558953493D16BC7E56
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0xB9B8FA6E891863338AD81A0E4A3121CB
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0x0CE13E2EEDD1A4773A1CD3F6354A19CC
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0x70CE1AEF43FF5A25314B2467582076CB
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x41706EF49C11122B4C8D40EBAC2A6BD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x8DFBA1163D4CBC64F662C15241228B1F
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x3FBCA7C8FB5C62E4412256E9E6CB8A30
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0x9977E5C1C3A05C0AEEEABAA2F47A484A
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0x53E42999030D0B49B76266B80D20523C
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0xBB0D46213B5CDD47C63D5180E41883CD
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0xD89CFBFAE35492B3DC78630E6281DCB3
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xC171D351B30769FE119E98526F234051
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x20E59F0866209AA02964B3EF0D84CB57
that it were my home!
0x0D3936BA5F13D7BDEAA37083D870B451

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x46AEC161C85A12A99FAF45A567431F8E
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0x194F4BFA516F5C53C30773026353ECD8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x8303C9546CC84F5D23139B24558E0715

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0xE08EFA536E3903274934A3309B49565B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x324DB6A1055055B0C6F0FF15441C6671

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0xDF1470EFA43EB801E6776EEB19A70FBD
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x661C14DA66822C144B4DBD8F55CFCFF3
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0xC58A4A55F41B9D2FD80F395E42BFE7D7
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0x2E043C57C2C6B87D2404E4910FE38085
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x10105C99009E67543192554D9AC3D24B
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x061BBEDCA588465386005FE5FE33E9EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0x370211A3B780590B3FE51B63648237B3
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x0E8462BC9A99A99FA7B10FA2A9777FDF
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x17753412DEF27656DD27017F6928EAD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x42FCA98DD3C2583736D7DE20B4C185A4
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x1F2EF7532998A9C277B5C2F1C03194F5
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0x1E1FCE001C29623D27345A3EBD882A30
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0x38F24DB3A6FE26C078E6E9A9BA630708
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0x6FC7A3F98A21ECDB88557FF797ACAC61
shed it over me now.
0xA5B09CDD4AD4194136833F3BF69699EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0xEC9EAE34FE27C34B701949A0DFA21C69
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x09CD6233B89F148E56829CFB79A0D3A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0xB1189F2D1A621D65292ED691030AAEFC
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x8139991FBAEBB64B15EE28169B1058B3
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0xCC52539D0C8820F3F595CA7BFEF466A7
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xFCFF45445DC8E27A4B00A6783109D0A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0xCA48CC1A8FD7A4691054A507EEDEA310
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xBCA9B8E4929F856A1801DA72F5FDE14A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0xCBB49A6BD5268A0388A53DA9B79FB47B
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0xD2959EE48D7128F66E2844275560BA61
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0x5FC6D3838B8387707A9E72F26D3E8358
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0x6FF852A7ED7B4407E5C66C804191957D
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0x850F7161A1F4CEBCFECDEA8EE4D65CCB
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0x72080BE994EEF5018A4787388EE3F05E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0xED628FA619B3225CCD70BDBAC7D8C626
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0xFED307082B25277DE25581F5E2BB224D
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x019E5520B86AF946E1A3A919D9CF9F2C
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xFC07442C358B9AA9F3E9FB9EDD065207
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0xF95DB62FCC3C02DC7E9370BEB25CF0B9
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0xCB52AE37E87322D97A5F7F685BEE3FD0
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x5242074E3AED15F9D229A2B7AD5CFD8B
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0xFD1532C265B627AE538FB41DD603CAC1
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x904715B6CF1A09A8C569E07F9BF398DB
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x967E72CDDE669CAA72BD2AB4D15B2DBA
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
0x8CE079ED08903D3ACDDFDE1B1D844B7D
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x534ECB53325A7B794B60BC221D4FF816
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x4D0168B4A7D7F40D08738C537ACD0990
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x9DF58AA0E3A222F2104E3110C94F201D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0xFB0FE374660C3D693F3544B422EBDA0D
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0x72E25E2FD4BEED2011FDFC9F92246393
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xFA1C940394CB7458749CED42BF18B166
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0x38BA511C48B6F9B275E21F4096DA9B28
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0x9B4F7DBBDDE5602AFA244FD18DA10FC9
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0x29BFCB896CCAC328687D1CCC4FA90AD8
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xADEFFA0177518C42DD92F844041885D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0x8F67557E2B6AC1B973123417BA41BDCF
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x563B5D0C688A68468675D2E3C616DB6B
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xE63AFDDD4D83210FDA5421038301E5D7
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x69E46B91C2BFBEC3608B53FA290AAB5C
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0xB5FFA472A098BB20373BBD6C7951C799
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0xABCAD047874F5B4C7103064EB38DF7BE
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x527D501182153E3A23C3F316D2DC45B5
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x4067BD21D35B0D224DC80B4D4B3E8A3D
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x61841BE1BE35FC598B43203A2EC61389
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x7120A71A651E8979332A92C4F2FF9667
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xE2C1C471AC2FDB5011A30260146CDEFD
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xDFFAA50FD93F76A9D923FF720D2EE728
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

CHAPTER XXIII
0x18E42F5593E91B0EA9619836692501E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0xEF0B8B5E25F22C0A4DC1788BA517EC90
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0xD2BBDF2033BD944A2720C5CC0931C47E
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x76E2FC330FC8AD3C6BB2BCDC0CF25BA8
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x3D721E04FB2602BE08F2DA735ACBC058
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0x6C34B92E01D111B022B737124C8B597E
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0x7CFCC9C1FC98C0CD5E41FF2671C10296
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x612EC3C9D68A8E34446FCA968F9190D2
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x37A5CCB4BBCDA778F7E24404BEE6779B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0xCB64241626360ECDEF60A7885E49753D
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0x38152543633398E2EFFCC308178F22B4
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0x9CBE6F826ADA543988A6229EEFC33B0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0xE04AE2823A92B6E9459B28A0DBEB710C
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0x9296A87D9A43F25679355AEE72526B55
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x6703687FA33E0077360A84E8B49419FB
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x1FE7BFA923B2204207E4AD19E4AD71C5
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0x5F0BC59C8AB5E8FBC84DA902EC4A4A62
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0x44F3366DC5402469B1D47868E079FF2C
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0xC0711993DDD5C6B66DE4AAC7215F09DE
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0x76ED78D0C498585F83B4C89D039FE0C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0x79322D2E425ED77265BCFD2CE6728A64
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x1D3C7CBE016C513F666144DE8E029C1B
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0x512FB214F186F375C2F3C41ADA228FF6
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x39583C5FE6384D83F821B839242C3DCF
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x83A5B9BD1B42B209520E57B2B98BFA7B
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x31AF22DEEB5968DFE5396A66A86B9C8B
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0x26FD8B1F63A48079D6457E847A6B0294
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0xDEA7F8A8BD6786339A65CC2D53C654D2
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xAEAE2DF987756B4023A7FB16FAEAD485
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x8E413C05B9F7FF702FFCA38A3400E250
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x59645DBF332ED54CF83A415F513079D7
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x426B95B5F53B64BFE9F4E15451486176
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0xB7CBC3AB5BA4F478E0298E3C1FF84C8F
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0xF319C33807C011BF0D9DF707A210E82E
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0x19277CF2469EA139E5B3D10981BDCDD4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0xB6ACF271AE274A7B92E59CA894049971
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x22C4983AB06C59FCAD501DF85DD44063
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0xA98701542876CF713BA0F8949B73D525
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x7E205DCD00C4C5E5BB78EE581B2B094F
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0x67917CEFA37AF627E1F20F4F027CFB8E
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0xD08F7C12188C8F29B8A1005A11A5C09F
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x33BA52CA979E5355B5174A8663642F8F
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0x3E042A39EF93965CBC75B66C3CA62BF7
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x086BEC75FF7C86FA54E1A5FC4131B438

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0xC606D23E10B6377AFB49D7FCE8B4016D
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0xE0E9DBE1230A746CB114D8AE8F37FEC6
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0xEC34A621587BACF9EEDE61E21BB16F8A
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0xE5ABEAFD32CF9FA3B2FF47F965D1BC94
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0xCAF13F9D517F726DB77AC3555499F790
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x88059CF0537988A647D7BB73FCD854AB
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0xD0576D9AA5A876ED94748636CA169AC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0xA8F9041A7C7C04C6C65DB9F4C79B54AC
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0x1372344DF8CBC61782184A476B32F86C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0x650066092F1B3F59A393E239EB32B6FE
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xDF4EDBD0E2F670A5D45658CF2AD1F035
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x582862E10DBBA330EB8127DCB60D88BA
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0x38C1C56E056BDB0122706DA16694A445
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0xF3EFF3F8FA44E212054251DF14A9D7CB
turning--
0x3CB2A67BF31DF01FEB797F8EC67AF65A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0xBA8B09D0ACD108E42CC660AEACDD1C48

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0x1C89030391106D56EA6034A374A834AA
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x57EADE3F1F20B2ED72DF5F7B9673C84E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x93EF53BA35896ECAC490D7CA171E5027
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xEEEAD2DA15548194CF4E54C7ACADD8FF
there! he is flown."
0x5C8E613B1BAE349F3C4DEDA69ED059BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0x5F0AB0070987FE723C266092A92A9A82
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x1DE145C196729A872376DACC7111B29D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0xD49F7B8B848BC7486C06B0BC6225B994
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0xF4216829691A0048DA794584B2A2C1B5
moonrise."
0x20854021BB6FF7C2AD1F28A75AE0338E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0x4B14FB2CB37354069CEB7E49B6E58169
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0x253DAC9B12950E8E81765F34A88FA0B6
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x011269D73FB0C368D676CBD228ED0762
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x916804D9C855B0E64570E38F0722DE6D
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.

Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x78A176AB1F0E0550A4DB6A83F33C7E17
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x4EA60040822B6409E2D55AE5A37A719C
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x85A7A40147ABFF2CA390A5AE872EF05A
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x45F56D08BBCBC8264FCF3CDF51A2A95A
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x7C1148E70BA5CCDADA1C3523B0EA0BB5
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x89C72FCD1C35A5A730244642CEADA7FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x0C1A0EDADA92088118479735FAF26210
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0x00A2B7DFBD54D97356FB55D8C53A0B59
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0x97F32D69A1F703D7FB01B7EF48FC8EA8

"I am attached to it, indeed."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xD751BD7DC3471CF2AEED8411B55D2206
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0x54D11EEA47B891C8CFE6082066595529
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move

must."
0x79567BC979567BC937EE2D26DF0590CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.

"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
0x4E36539610FA23546185287027ECA38C
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
0xD3886A3443FE13B01ADE48798E0CE1B8
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
0x451B7D3774346E97D945D020E9B91554
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
0x9CFB85BA20A8DD4E3F1C3484DA9254A7
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0x8D5037FC1AF986CDE44A798317D5106A
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0x11C879605F676EB14A6CEBECC8E17661
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0xE4D60B1815F59256798FB40F9E3B6CFE
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x4665750A977712808E51E7390FE1C66A
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x4905D16E1A4AE5577524A31FF06970EF
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0xD8DE49242A095C7709F93656432D3491
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0xCF40578BCF551BD454930E518A305994
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0xE655C1BD317591D28FEDC35AF8331D0B
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0x61D03FAE63CA496A9108F9090BED394F
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0xB0F6683E813521F619BC8DB38836A6BD
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0x1E3B4A1B59F54D33BED910381C40FDF9
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x8E97E445CADDC5622C5BB48382641699
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0xEEE4D8DF196CDEDDFF4A87C74DDB101F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xB68B5A6D78665385581557FD41DB5913
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0x23517AE14CB0C5B0D623A7593FF45609
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x184E11E09376FE3A16F6761A7F0E02AF
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xF3C3A8214DC42E780383742A9600A7ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0xC60B4793B770F0E851CC2EC85BE5E161
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum

for you."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0x87E0A308BEB2D380C14C1E7C43F7AFF2
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x3DA6803FEE86CFD1A229591E3F1ABE36
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x2D657EEBC891A5BCB415BC57F5C9CC39
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x651F7501EBA88C707631909BB031AFAA
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0x24FD6542BD8D8163399B94D379E946B6
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll

like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x38D7703408001936460D66A54C4E2022

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a long way off, sir."
0x2CF966B14097A4F39017E4C7EC70BE31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the

distance."
0x3F98199740269728D5E21BCB4629A28C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x6E6FBA1068CF52002C9C57074C801231

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"From what, Jane?"
0x25FB5B551E19C1410A2C25BD7702C15A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
0xDB1919385D40A98921AC3B8BD8448002

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well?"
0xBF65D68ABF65D68A3333903C58ABDCD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"From _you_, sir."
0x31B61E4B53E5D76A454AC34B169ECFC6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x839595669BE64F728FCD3894FDE45EAA
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0x0877BC587B8BD3F4E496C0C32374FF11
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0xDC08DE1AC57710F71DF0EB81DEF107F0
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x4D2197A73C2C0A9E1317F37FA93AE296
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x994A349C21307658907FBD1D23239865
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0x35EB90950BABBDB1B7150EA25F2A9C7F
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xF8F2A4DDA747FD7B4389F172C10ADA9B
loved.
0x22420B0F22420B0FDABCCFD574A71101

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a long way," I again said.
0x0687D71A9385B5916321CC7F15706258

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x98933FFE633A0405B66B9597A32A4D28
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0xDAE9B2DFA29089C1E056E777F4E8BAFF
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0x8FD2500B6BA6067229ED5A0BE1667ED8

0xFFCAC50DD6A2B25E73114B07CE62DE51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the

little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xFAF2CADFB9DB5356F371E598A387C364
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x7FDC32AB2D89E9EF2BB4A4394FCEB181

0x8C1146511A46E926B5F5911017A3578B
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0x13FC504EC6C06895C54C8F930A2B27A5
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0x900646056CB46FB59AA3A6C76B9C2A27

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0x263018619E40F3076FD6B19BDAE1F42E
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x60340DC9096818376541D16A2CAB0105
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0xDD61D871EA82587F1601B20E4C18AE77

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x94E553984E704DE01AB227CB24F0BA22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x42826253AE7D53DD7568453A5608FD50
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x0049CC199640AD5BF07B6E47257BF651
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0x19F1D18BBFA7869BAC42199F7DEC2FDD
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x075D543A29B560DB5D64128FD4EE6066
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0xEA16D1643C591619152FC017E86767BC
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x995C46005A78D6FF364C6916A7FE0E18
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0x547F63273A818B9B901CBCB41EEAC563
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x0FA2C2FCC5FF8821E87E46BCB63CB260

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0x94D83988EB1C78734BCC22BA19098B24

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0xA991CFF4AD9A08BA95759D04BBEB8437

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0x14491D91CFF8ED728AC4516E644F9D70
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0xCE4AD5ECAFFD00FDB85EE60B1293760C
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0xE415B3C6B981C06C9246C3188D708A31
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0x63BAE311DEACBB525D44F212604D18D0

0xA3581AD7129E329B89D17A6018AFFA80

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x04FEFB142CF82A33241FC5B1CA3AFB1C
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0xB664D5D85B99EEBDF0169F45EDFF5C79
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0xA9AD3817D97517474712A8919E0D4EE9
speak.
0x93DD650093DD6500F9881667119AED45

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0x92EFBCAE6E63CA19820975623F58855E
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x95222D3D9A6B9AD2121A824CFC84B5EB
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0xCB36136FC88B41314B9C0173B4C35256
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x6CEFD24DFF9E0289F466B8D58B8FC800
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xE5F78033E0D1F57FC8900D08824BB1D1
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0xF4E814897BD6E0617188DB5C6CF746AD
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x7AB364A85D55AC7F4439466EE09FFCB2
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xCC9B82A5D7336DE2B77836DB6E8AF3F5
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0xA8495FEF38C2332F68599E936D1E1B01
on the necessity of death."
0x5721CF31FCF2C6EDF542DF5702C793F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
0x790CF2A1F90EEB12116A9AB9EBD8BCE1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xA450AF5B3665AD81EAB0DEFF825D412D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x7DE6C551D05D48F672E8EC427488C2A4
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xB0079281DF5ACFC0E328A5DAC07713E2
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0x8791F2563186540813236AC06B679835
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x19CB7A9F583ECC6BDDA43FA1DC16B96C
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x1B31508B8F102640ED27693F5B92AC4F
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x163F5D098BFF4DB92C434EC0C645ABD3
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0xE503C16D878832AB7900361EAAF21B0C
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0xDC8B465C9A8CF5B7E59DBE1CD2EBB3E6
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0xFEC05D9182EFE0A397971DD4B5A56E8C
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xDAA60DD2476D171119BE9499381B3F31
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0xC4A42E89C9B447559A4F804BFCF21912
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0xAAB000371B3E8207D8E681EB1066D32A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x651F1D2A22A32F2A0560BEDDA8090FEC
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x42814EC8488D9EC9EC39BA7BF90EE5CE
Jane!"
0x19ABC13D19ABC13D22C14111123087BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x8FB57CE8D520508E74BA19246A9072B5
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xBC169ABA40E38F0D092BA68B7E1DA968
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0x7EFFE2E480E520A750699944B8AA3D11
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0x90B41B687362E4A6C5A39EA7141017FD
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0x4041CB6A696E705DB203058E90F40E93

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0xEDDE74C5FABE0222B02A783F19D62AFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
0x6FB7C8A2C3724A5E88FCB390E923E418

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
0x956C6F0CF3F3E236C2619EFE68963418
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
0xFB5E2643EDFBA477A9D5498CE03B5F3E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
0xA36D33CF2CA6005384731F603F599BA4
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xD51F851B9E6129F95A8CCDF2A71E65D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
0x8BC00616061A6A20B61BD2A7743C3776

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
0x115482D9FCFEF7CE6BA0BC783B555044
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
0xE2C7C7577B9DBC711B987B00112D076B

0x5423C9C432592B5207BEDC68809DA068

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
0xABC912DFE554B976FA69C76D3FA40CE4
best earthly companion."
0x68CDE59CACD3B3743C36AB6AA33B258D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0xF8206C9EBD058CDB58C2F3672331AED5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xBEB0A52E8884F2482D59BF0A3058081F
too."
0x6F8C29756F8C29758BE5183D7EE485F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0xCC93D8277AEABEDA2D7FDF233223F194
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0x3BEDA6B95D39B483C12F9492B907298A
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x237FF98462D34D02411B6411C984521F
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0x5602C9EA92D9B8BA6B3412EA3399437E
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0x8F0BDEBD3F1B0EF8BE4789A14273CC39
said--
0xED2ABE6DED2ABE6DFFECE641E1E5B044

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xF792A80700124315C2040C59F065BFCC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0xAC25A30FD54F71DA6DFBFF1F1EAF2C82
return."
0x2F6E2F0D3D7DEE73F9B8DA1C13858842

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0xB711A9887B854D7BE8E550DD4F0AA9F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x9165C90453E586DE0E5E59152F2F008C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0x27D718F2E85E96BE1E95969752682643

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your bride stands between us."
0xB68D9EB902386B8F2256F9811B6DAE58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0xED815FCFD11D2F964BE5D7F76CD20B02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0x19FA93089149B7DFD3DA1A276CC28CCD
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x3E50447E02528417470A8CAD1768195B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0xA42F10195D0019A594CC9CD9F0A2BA4A
was still incredulous.
0x48EEC1351C068744E35B1AECBE2B7C8B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x6871A1AD3EE80CE48A1667AC78CE6270

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Entirely."
0xDC31C62B6E26CAE9C92F193B791AD159

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have no faith in me?"
0x16664E2F6571FDA617507008D781112C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not a whit."
0x583B9CFE6F513F2255C13C9CE7B09FF2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0x3586C63342E25401EC426F846B9C6E84
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0x5CCCC91D0727B23698306E8A8FEAD630
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0xDEE55840E145A5AD8A0158024FF53D45
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0x665BFB8E34287FE1114DB62AEFF2D5AA
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0x94297BC8EB54D1DCB0349546E0A28A5A
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x43080D3669EC03A789E8E7764F49ED4D
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xA7C0DC92EA2AFD5DF7A52067C2409A41
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x519903123BCD68F7F1EFD77D479FE781
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x3B2A0A4FC75AA2C71003A3AF107D7BE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x98A1C8259F3F7223058A1AB33A3DF78F
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0x9441AC3A40E367B5950600F30A929BD9
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x3B7221E6A0B2A8DF6796DC2F8CB37D9F
given me?"
0x46210C9234D8F6102DDDAA1F6C282D5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x2A4D6C2D45C1FA2E6B0A87E0C3D74673
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0xC551056515D0A6F2C940068A84A0B3EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x2530DE17D70B94B47E598BB01C93E15C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?"
0xAA617C58AA617C585B4BC71B70A543D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x2666EBD07A5C168E328B3C3638C05D3B
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x827C7792C696BE8515FA833605779035

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x9744B395E553792231E813F99A755D48
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0xE37E0289D6E314F0042F8395F8B2E9D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x60298CD63EC49FCB7E42455810939B47
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xCB07A6D4E8CF2110C06359F4078D5ADF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0xD21695FC948376DE5BD6F0B33CD01FE7
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x60324EA65C4597DB108B01B70213C09C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0xB97C8C1189B5C362B7E46DCBEB3221BD
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x9178BA25DDBB4BC2AA4AD687AFE296D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x88933DD663D8C8E09FAC787A42599294
be your wife?"
0xC26D533F7512EE7D1ED17379BDBAAA99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0xA2A206A10BEDF80E171A10C49369C273

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0xEF0FC80A719CA514964D209C6316C229

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Edward--my little wife!"
0xC308BE749061EF7CEFF7B744E6E920BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Dear Edward!"
0xA1A4B213238053B6FE3FDC553E161D78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x836031E44D5F9CAA4FC1223485B053CD
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0xCEB101B8DB428D078C17842DA1FE7FC9
happiness--I will make yours."
0xD5AA8216945E6F643B830B654FA4F480

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x6CFD2D90B66272EE6BE771C040C42071
have her, and will hold her."
0xEAD0E9DB5E48DCECA2FA051A240E4ABA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0xCAD018E0C0A63844CB8DBC4F5059DC0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xD173AD1152B4F4F822F2A95544C536F4
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x3D7C07D808CB9D08599D4897FD2DE9B0
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x3F5A4486338E7F02EF80B114CE54399E
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x1B009112A8AD9E13E869180FED15B5CE
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0xEA78B479F4B603BFC36BB337D07C8AC6
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0xD7EC628EAB0BBDA57DD1D5DF8C6B3731
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0x4AF2DFD2EB2BC33C9DFA7B5CB518C1D2
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0xE9A24D5E21A50DA89E18AB555A6D91EB
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xACA90A9F56A086B4D709379DBC0EE2CC
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0x6968C89BD933A61FFBD8E7E4AE880B1F
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0x77735D5198B5131D68857935C19ACE27

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x7316C670613FC5288F1C21558FE861AC
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0x00E6E3404AB88D575CAEEB7502B0485B
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0xBDF777211BC021B1A28EFA6780930B7B
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x48B88410FD116B998B087811461C7BDA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0x5198738AEBE670D11A52F057315953B5
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x10FB69E9E8BA2641BE5F980620D653D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x38E1F28F5FAEED1E25411B34A3CEE3CF
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0x939283521DFA1B3EAC19AC7C7C0F1A40
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0x3A92856529C60EB9BA82569DB7EF2435
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0xBC8B2FE2C659D24F9302395273CA8B7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xA8D7E7B5806C44DA6EE5A51281E1A87C
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0x57C0FE835BD5F0707665A8B975A8A44B
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0xE1929C3F8E2399164C7FD231F46A6026
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x8CEBABC543F6BE7618F0AC36604D4CB0
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0xD269ABEE51CF588CC4524624B5E4D432
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0x14C5AF2BFE999D7FE8ED2B84D1F5D449

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0x1D5725AB14FCCFB99498605ECA7FCC72
night--good-night, my darling!"
0x5F0782062E5D0733B60643A7016C6295

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0xB8A5222F5AFA9ED1F5F29B274BE80FDD
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x2A47EB1053D3CA9618CBA03E002C8AE2
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x216EB23D113023466087C210548BF5D7
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0xF540E24050AAF59ADA9E29ADAD092533
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0x172194F2F01802E8734CF1F121BB7AF7
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x972955572A33AADCE912A310494102C8
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0xDC44AB67969F731682FC18778BCC2029
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x47CA4FF4C8CC81CAD5DDC5E2AB7B68C7
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0xF6B8A15E1E98A5056115185E7C5DD515
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0x2DFB99378172DA2663F677429AE62A63
strength for anything.
0x4B45938AC316B8890D56DBD3C37955C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x5A6B65F7EEAAB5A25235A0C5F2A97D31
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x8476AA40945F4963093978EDE1D73665
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.

CHAPTER XXIV
0x019A70D66B03ECB2F2ADD3DE5F116A7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x4634A4FD1E25A69D17E19CC8D6060666
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xA0B8877D5F4111F227DBFFC1853C93C3
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x32D723E55E95D8C15A7599BF50148C31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x1D6BB29E3B1EC990B1183CB3AE12838A
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x0B9E2DA20B18096B004A4076E8A0ABDF
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x280D55764A2CCA1884C23BD7B5112DDD
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0x02DA01C2C1D429CD1455739F24A62A16
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x018448A93062A38F1A99750895B70540
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0xA663449671E5710987C9903A43AC824D
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0x424AA74488AA40547CCD97F958294D26
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x6379FBDF3DF333F18295BC84FFD11CC3
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0x754D3B95F56CEACA6E35509361F628B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x683923A83247554CC379887A24589184
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0x23155265BE99917C5E06D3C48443D9C5
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x0A77B221637B110EF5384C1399EA99D3
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0xBEA9439084DC6D261F51E0434C61903B
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0x618C3EA8D1D2DB5316B3F10B8FB9D34E
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xFC416A58498046F8A10CB6CA4B637855
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0xF24165476CEE315304E342E62637DADC
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0x0F1DAA649DBB3D926F0103032F29B1A2
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0x6464D905262885A84FE53766F802DE88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x4707562CEA0BAACC3C823CC0799C0BB6
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0x918D19F508BC3FFAD4A99C7449CD2D97
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0x2B9BCC6EC2240F07B5065E981B58E0F3
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0x285C51BE34A17855D65E72EA34516A7F
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x4BA2B7E3C06C7CC53741A855930B0079
schoolroom.
0x61BBB5E119E566FF82C4F821428878C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0xC1674D3608820FC3B620DC8E6B407BE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x74DBF7FA13ECB79806DF5DE008960AB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where is he?"
0xD657C024C99B4E120E7DDC2376BD34B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x5C4889BD126EA8944FB42F5F2739CCE1
there he stood.
0xEE466EB1699C977908D7AEF031015ECE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0xCCEDAE6CFDB05E7122AFF9AAE2D74BE0
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x4A9AD595D1D069BAE75EB0140D72B270
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x19596614CE6A3B91A16A050C102C4BEE
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x8911BD476CB3B45357FA85341362BF0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x93BD3EF795B7BE5C7F61B1FD77CC0F63
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0xA929F620C619C3063DEBF3C47E7DEA94
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0x1A86F3F7CB4B1093D062FB048F1C81A9
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0x9F1DA51F4D3A799A511D7B2B83A0C29F
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x601EBC8B9202283EDA7835456E7795FA
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0xEDC495C8AFEF9EBD73723293D257112F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x90090C1E0095CEC770EB2A636B10FB52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x649D1F37621A030ADFCDEB9FB349BF7E
more.  Do you hear that?"
0x304697DF0F33137DB6CCCC8D0C908059

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x51025CD172B5D4203EF259E01381586F
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x7FA9387237BB5B06BDCA3663752529D0
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0xC5FFCB4EFB2B91867F58B9D4D8505C0D
think almost fear.
0xF15CD3868CAB83855BAA6EC1D3B046AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x66317B45A8B7D1976CF412AFFCE6A8A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0x5F1AB5FED1790F16B3D5FCECAFE6CF22
strange."
0x72E35FE4C20B59D02211480677D428AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0xA974AEBF7FB492BB090C6CAF30BD0239
Rochester's girl-bride."
0xCCCB4C71E9CF9D76998F382DCCD5084E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0x2F5428025579A121769B71C93E7CA414
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0x0FD33CB6E40F4E7506774A7FC189C233
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0xEE3F7C245F51AF8731DA9D0934EE4301
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x5E1934B5B8E109728E900818920F4DA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0x5370D5F72A6190AF3B7BDC6EF01E2711
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0xB5A59BB3055CC42E73467C49A50FE5BF
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0xDB6404F35F08B1490E5AAC7A3A6D17D9
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0xA64E9EBD49F692C1EDD73E8C6345289A
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x9C772F51BB4C41DA5FDED285ABA231CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x815DF1775D6837BAEEBCC576C60A7644
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x1B9955998A90E7C72C738FB9EC36D086
have them."
0xE9F75A1A33FBF85E3C1F5153A75FEC75

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0xDA3C3C8AAAA14784B94BE3F205BBD79F
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0xABB73556305EF95D50562C438EB17034
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0xE3813FAE070934C5AE6D9B37D4516E0C
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0xD80CD6A340BB7E547C1AA6DC27D7CCE2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x78CFF0F9430D736FA21FEF2C30D36609
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0xFEC31239C24539AB557CD7D2C4FC6C9A
Quakerish governess."
0xEB101F4DCD7641783EA762ABE5E307BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0xC2321CE5C246F92C5BFFB7CB3B53E6F7
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x2B1F0F4CEEC50927D46272BD61A3D6FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x845CAD08462AADF43A81957047008808
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0x44872150313FE44C0B5D2E38101760F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0xF4E463689D60A37FD2732E67AB1A1B70
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x4A58B1AAD6AE065B610EFACEE8F1E9C9
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0xD841ADBE25DEC494DE0BB72173932A92
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0xB7AE263C9A208F4C9356E319BB6C4003
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0xA516E7FD635932E1A1DEC6849DAD954C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0x84C1495EC3A804510FE254C7620A2B15
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0xC2003174A7B822AC1231465DA0BE900E
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0xD8A63F112E4754EBC6535116DB97FD36
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0xF0F80E21FFE876AC17DD04427DCAB53F
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0x5547FE6ED17B7CC23967A61B048FDEEE
flatter me."
0x5A49026B1C920CFCFE79B99F07207DFB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x27515531596815DF083C4F8C5BBB2898
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0x9117BAE472254F70724CCE438E51D3D1
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0xC7925BC924ADFF28A64A2AF9CDFC664C
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0xCCE0B48AE1EF5FCABAA14903702C3504
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0xACCC04E81F6C44DDF1E95992C85C30BE
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0xAAEF9A493380B0450611E3787B21E6C3
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x4ECB304C30867BF87F8294D2CE3B265A
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x6DFB7D987223FDFC973D37950447D941
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0xC02E3C5A95315494147AC42F7BB4331D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0xBED50ABB7DFE26E5F9E0623F35B65320

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0xFE52C026DEF2812BA9F4ADC58C0B63B3
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0xC127D96EC2CE66ED52B42ED181911BED
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0x063287DA805381DBBBAA22FC9546A42F
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0x49EBB4B8C0A7423326A508FE78682EAF
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x9C08F204A7E49EA0CD3A12D0B184012B
as my comforter."
0x347CAF05751C5F9D87AF745FF8B94EE1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0xA0385FF58C03FF87AFAC065EE2F9AF99
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0xEEF0EA0AD10C1EEA4129FAF74167A080
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0xE9D0F41D0033307F6EE891D8FFA0DC49
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x17FFB94D739F9968373EE3331911EBB2
anticipate."
0x6DA82DEA31FAC43AD653FF0336B0AD52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do you anticipate of me?"
0xD8A5EE954653632F381E4CC68425946C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0xAC1AC668D18C9E9DF85A9109548DD140
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0xA8304E3E4C2DAA6EC9CDF40242C96FC7
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0xEF7A44307A391455229C005D20EB4602
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0xBDCFBE8705735D6EE6C000E0770BEE51
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x8770D805381705FEB9D32DBBBC6140F0
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0xA2646BC5DB20DCA0E5CFEE50824C9BF1
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x06AC633FA2AC88712D2B2E9A8ABABD83
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0xA0D0C6C66272610D80F350C261BE0530
dear master."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x7AA92DD5F349D8A3074442DA64B0A1FE
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x146FCCC6063BFE1F4411427382E6DD8B
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
0xF80FAE71469D3C0DAB423121516CAA36

"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I

find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0xB3EB190041BF541F6F4A3475786DD244
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x4F742614FEF283B2FAF4BE7DC60B09B2
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0xA8BC482901B250FF64128E8EFE948D9C
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0xFDDC740ECAB41B743CBAED5031F3C4D7
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
0x7C3B34ED92E3B292ED3E72CCE0D9988B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
0xDC9B07936C23D998ADC8A6C61BE0F044
such an one?"
0xC2952BA758870DD0B7ED7ADC00A16888

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I love it now."
0xABA7868C78C5FD45B8C72B8581EFF24E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
0x2A3DB627E19C7007768CB646894A1ACF
standard?"
0xDE84BECDFA1DE3E6A5DEC5A446865A13

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
0x3E3FC90A93203086A34C115A2CC129CE
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0xEB60904C0D42B5D8A955DD864899E78C
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0xDC8C84D8459A288C8AAE5FDB53965A80
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x82AC58A9F76BDB06B8DEC365A2FD2278
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
0x1A9EF7B21FC76D86764B079408E8A17A
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
0x8300DDA362263200BB259082A7917F2B
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
0x5FD52E808832446AC95E687B74E8D882

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
0xD8791E5671A8276FA87FA0E4414F1343
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
0x248E9C6332E9456E54CB00F92EE2B490

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You were, you little elfish--"
0xAB10110F23DE5C6F3CEFEE6497D9BFE6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
0x7804936A0BC10582A216D26B953D76AB
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
0x0A90CF043ABCB76A40EA91B7A91CEBFC
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
0x12205535250D6F17BF984BAB7F08BEAA
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
0x9E180A19DA9C7BB4DE3E033B841004A0
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
0x60FBBE074774FF71EFA41B9F817D2BBF
pleasure to grant."
0x56978BBD2B8D98039D5B612BC70C330C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
0x5BB420897FEF5A5F30274C7025AFF929

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
0xEDFC1BCE10B38ADA84093A77E938A531

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x8962F126D31FD984473E2F3FB73CF31E
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x984628F50EA8774DFDDC9D0BDC3DF2E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0xF88F3F95406BBF0B7675AE90A14510A8
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0xCAD084F6DFE524B2279A30A723E9FF2B
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0xF55CAD9B4204AF96F61C5484B97EFA78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0xA6A8767AB21157DA00DCD054BEB86F8C
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x1E326DA785FAAEE1454D2DCA22976B61
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0x86EF0F1AE5339188658903909C9DF882
withdrawn: try again."
0x81377173274A1CDCA2E373AA6652F4B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0xABE5A8A651B360B0E4D83AA5D670E68D
piqued on one point."
0x260291C74FAEF6104928BB0801A43AF7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0x5BCCCC9A94DB958E7C60EE8403D9A859
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0x92A06B7FAB3E4D1F77312702AA71652A
request--"
0x7EDA9378719101610C21676280DF7D95

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0xAFFE2891ADBFBF5C2D7FE47EEAE5F401

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0x17CF793CE8F04F23A110E31852D1A8B4
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x68D086BFA0C412DCD1DC1A6361A9B537

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0xE2AA996C888694F54E49227F78A6F16F
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x59E6AB8A87DDE36F5E38EFB116C001B5
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0x730291BD4EEB9DB6C46DD139B7075E8E
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0x57A38E2D56E5B15F1FCD57B3A21C24FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x0C1108E4A84720EA045C49E4A2D7DB41
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0x1D0BF9F9B3EC89BB43263B975B1DBE9E
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0xFE5B3F37CE13ABC8A049887853A5B1B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0xDB779F7B911CB46554259085284DB5CA
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0x5784FFA8B360613253551B305329A843
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0x06473544C7C845AD1C4A60E2290F4117
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0x2F400E90E2160202C01E2E1E1A25DCB1
of my power?"
0x932CEB68EE2D54F60373C6F3B2B3C15C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0xB0A8ED46FBEA779BDBA7EE8621C64F68
up."
0x484A13D9484A13D9DDA9595B2C7F50B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0x9FF2F7915BBD8EEE1FC46236CFD88509
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0xAFF890FFC3393B121DA8C1666FB583AF
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x6B72687C0D87A5A8644709F8F4EAF479
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0x9B8C2A7C51A5AD59BD9952BCF5369C05

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0xA1A2B1AFD2B24DF7D7AE5B354946EEC2
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0xF3E686373130484411AB4C539D9BB65A
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x8F6495D9B0327A9866B2FDED2FEBA9FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0x89116DDF517C49B1CC973F7A91DD6F61
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x6EF9FAA63F5B07B682BCEFE7D497A9BE
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0x61843367024F338A84B9E4D341FB399D
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0xCEB3332AEA804A65C23620EE46E3D16F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x9EE970B20553852426AD01CBC51A3189
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x941F7C246766DE50E956E6A17E5B31A2
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0x533A28B1CA67BD8D48C181733AF405E5
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x063DC7D233EAEEEF9E5DC84DD17B7E13
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0xEFF8408C649C0D4BDCF57C9F6615D87E
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0xC095C377764BA42D1DC1798DC4D95AF2
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x96788CAD282C922B43705155649DAFFC
made me the offer."
0x8BA4713608613681A1DEFDC331716720

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x6E2FB79BB89C241C05B150875FEADFD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x810ED6CDC72D024F5C0FDC6FA3334397
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0x9A066B9119D8E6CCB9D6A48B45D83589
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x564FB19FDBF25CFC761AA2C50FE2A09D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x3E31A9AB685F1A06331DB1CB42D2FD5C
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0xAAE4CBBD874B2F026E22742AF14FB073
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x7FDBAE2CAF56DC79AA74C8DEDF7B701F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xC6FA502B0EE57822F789C959FFFEE8FC
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0xDB536ED499A4947963D887D8B2C350CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0x38849B1401420D0823840E3EF4FAB987
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x00AA5759CEE43892D7FFE1C26824BE1F
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0x9697BD8050B92C6792DA2B4AC1B04214
deserted?"
0x3DEEA8F931A8BD1B2595FB7781AD079E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x79A497D4C6A0A3CF72E18CADA3637856
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x7578B19B5EE694DF2C8A37295501103B
moment."
0x57FD4342E5B2EFE1C08A76B390198DB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x2D594279180AB24114422A01551FA10E
principles on some points are eccentric."
0x9FF1CC9F223A27E0926A22B3EA603642

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xC987D34EB8EAA1E836C2277F0856B6B1
awry for want of attention."
0x13B4B3376872A67114A9497F48BCB8C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0xA1948FF28CA66FA08C73B5AE33698627
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0x766656461F87291DA8D0714EE23D4B22
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x0DF415CE0E6E9616DA0E8A62A0919B16

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0x83EBC8199CA52FB1219A5001838057BC
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x069BAED3A08C8420C9D6611919D87D3B
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
0x92C7BC00A98EAAEBD43EF6E12F0B3D62

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0xDAF58A8BB2C0F9F9F4AD8224599F7CC4
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x0CA5FA6E4B3FA8E1829E9B381DE8E40B
express.
0x2281A874B5A20B1FD0F9AD1467E14A7D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x3E0631F1152AD01D95E31AE1EFDC6F1A
entreated, and to yield."
0x4F0CC65FCDC2B8D5559F33B525F2B77A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0x69273DA37B00E3222D758A51493F5F9F
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0xF4BE9914C2C7224DE934E1EB8338A128
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0x538B3F88806749D97C00FD41C1FAA4A2
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0x646C3D7E6DE758ADC48CCA752AE8AADA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x97F9611C8D01738CD1B41B64F6B48A94
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0xB099FFFB19B7D6105ECAB8A3B78DCBE2
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x90B802628C394E14FFF08EE01011DA92
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x64E975B06ABD36B415727F25ACAF2B65

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x1903FFEA7EE74B24F398DA9BE64C2A15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0xA361355FFCEEA50D55798B362B4B665B
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xFE91FD3CD378722F3689CD4205E8C369

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0xDF6EADAF651A7801E952652556389D6B
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0x54D81754C62A8BC411844F7E1C82EEF0
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0x637CE83780BF8C21186BC912FBD4F10A
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0x3754C530F8D92321F8B408DA5A38156A
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0xD21760E0D1CD78B25370CFCA2683791D
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0xA8D51B4FBDAC0FEFC0844C59337819B9
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x463D28A10FB9FDC25D467AA0A4EDF39C
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0x6EF22CD511F55EF4523C0327400F7EB8
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x6A6F25A5F451E5796C2198064D9B21AF
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xCD465601F314778749869F1C3FF86FAF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x3CACC71F25A42922686A5CE2D1254C5A
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x607E1C4803C1AFC00EC8EE56804A152A
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x3C6D8BB5FB2B542A386BE9A5335D6237
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x246A47093ADBB59ADD13330870B8FDD0
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0xD2D62D8BB13D709948CB672C6FBE50BB
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0x6DB80F32EA7AD4D27D645CDA3554A527
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xF5C87DD1B2583E3EBD947B7D841CA1AF
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0xB54488A63F6DC8C39B09C60780EC0EB6
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0xD49E6C1857E45D8131D0DA0C944A1BE6
you would be his wife."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0xE8FEC7FABE86DC581561E5A6ACF98B33

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x2C328E245211BE9D65469022678F62E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0xEDCD6B98966C514CBAADF7185E010F85
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0xB0E8625738E651675D78594354610B05
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x3E81CA250B6C455BEE7E4E95EA65BB30

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He tells me so."
0x9694B3DF97CDE18DA7FF09D4D2C2BE10

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x9D178FBB118D0CEC8075B2197970C999
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x123B8F811B7756770A3415CF13528168

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x0FFFA24F2549477FD043EFC3C1D6A190
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0x75FB9BFDC8BCD7740F8E317DA77FF4F3
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x52DA6411926134FC088EEAE2BA0B0351
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0x7B01015D426C0324791780207ED370B9
father."
0xAD4BD7F9A7A5C9EAC956D3C025787042

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x8E406CC45F3391F8F169F13435D96101
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x71D1AB7EDBEF2B9C07C52500B4DEB95F
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x7CAF364B86C7A38E8DEE430D7DF213C9
twenty."
0xF3155CDEB28951F6A0865E02C92B86D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x1FAA9AEADFC4590F614B428C505C5237

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0xC7F4234B709BBB1238B559FCAC5AA270
eyes.
0x98AF825998AF8259AF0FB0F48A85285C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0x577FA12B5B704BD653163DA0497BD3C8
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x1197430A9AB95E13EBD7E7DF89A38091
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x6B0F5243030AE3F5A84FB3ADBDAFB58E
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0xD88AD662D02AE320440FDBDA467D1080
I expect."
0xC23D035056117743D08A73ED0632843F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0xFCB7C9398D573CAE09CFAE657A055A6B
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0x170C7DA8CF9E74FFA8C9770A9EEA3364

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0xB0C0BCD9ACBCA971E8966E05BD7F7995
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0xCB6DBC4169989387781EE1A36B41BB20
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xBF10EE0D84E6805DB7E59A41C8A3784D
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0xC0F7F37AB19A131CD4BD4F902F65797A
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0xA56924330F0477642CE1305D7E0474B0
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x1DB21C3A606746B45CBB4F07090BCB88
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0xA72AFBD9E6CF5A0918174C806B36CE47
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x88159B4C08EF5820C03FB01B43103420
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0xE90DC132A65590EF075D6E11CB57CDA9
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x0A96D3C6D6D00DDC9CB3FEDDE9F6E87D
him."
0xAD7921DCAD7921DC4383BFF57B100A4E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0xCB858228D9A3A96E3FD386583ADA8538
that all was right."
0x9317913A2F2769033CB70AC6BA485685

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0x9496C6883467538F335951F74C181D34
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x659C2885209E90BF469DEE3A2A09FAEC
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0x4CA72603DDF9A9CE69DF80378A177567
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x71E549EB7FE3665A264E22CCAE4CD130

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0xBF10EEF152470DDCE8996E0561F6DCB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0xCDA6A4616D9F2679545B30B6ED9744C9
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0x6082A71F9AD2A0E55C8402024E470831
me go mademoiselle."
0xED20E05BF671D72163EBABE886F81A39

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x54F1D45556E2FE4C0AA956AEE5BEC03C
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0xEEBB5F9157F2459E2A4152095DEBA4B8
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x67C3D4ED949A57B87C242AA4C25A15F9
backwards and forwards.
0xE96ABFC60FB62EC7CA33B0AF0D30E489

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x5EEBE8405D792637514530538600D7DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0xD87EA8D7FD7BDC6B8418DCD59CE96E43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x2997DD54DCD614C8E4254251F7B4F881

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0xA8B2A9CD4DEE4704E9CCD95469253437

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x58D8305C2021612E8A236531F32060A5
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x4AAE95430198A4F2B6B699238EAE0D6F
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x4D24FAC7F28FB8963DC449BDC52C4115
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0xD5C46C72717E7CC36E1D299FAF7978D7
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0xF97E650FBA1303BEC1BB4FB60D1A0E96
my face.
0xBAFA724869F069684A990C57EE30A726

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0x7760A180A2ED247604D7A2E92AD5B492
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0x156360CA8E4E5E3AAA657D2D724E9D2F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0x2AB057DA41562E3731F1674662AE2A08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x14955431E11D1975A09E33666EB0DBD4
to Adele.
0x36B28C136A8AA290AA1481C861D49691

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x3BA74B2D4E5BB192AC75F23C8779D323

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0xBDD763A7D1532F09039AE47D43353BC5
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x222CAB19D6366EDF02DBA6F3A1706AAB
company--for life."
0x85DFF00A1B9771C6374D77B5ECF08AFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0xD0AC1B31E8F147B6CE6793D9A292F078
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x4B495CB3F094069BD00548079FFA9511
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x23052567B6268859ACCD4999A9217304
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0xF91B630B02D8B07792912482F3D329B1
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x331D64E0C6736112EA7438A3050803D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x1B00A337E7AF047BE1224784C16357C8
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x421A848D2EB0A68AE7CF267F5D250863

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0xB3F35E694C880FA3AC3D89B2E68831A8
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0x4A2C92B4EC233DDA57B75F438638BA9D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0xB2C4AD1D93E5EF70553A485FAB1B4BE3
mademoiselle?"
0x1B930D8B3BFC2BD6ACB7952EB568715F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0x0765DC9F3740FC8A44762F3DBC88B643
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0xCF95D79C1E614E114DAB4733F0D622F4
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x02A0CBB275180E00762C421FA49BB653
there, and only me."
0xBCCFBF8D526ABC9A4F0461AC7041FEE6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xB4FBC0F49C3C1ADF873DBD4B37865DCA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0x4FB255B95AD5444240CDC08EE345DF08
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0xE70A28B05015016354C2179F452447FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0xB8914B05DA810ACD2B6B50E3DD54C3EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0x42D942E913DFCE8B77BF46A1AD4C2E7E
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xE49B11C85C384421DFB80F6BA672BB6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0x2A18614D67247B3A390CBEACA19B9CA2
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0x02D4AB2F77F232C7282B836E353EFEA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0xA1F255D79C98252EFD78C70B477F0371
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x82B3B266FB0C7CC9DAA9FB29E6EC3847
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x917BA6CFF295B73A89F88C21A750008E
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xE2C2D2EDB2AD6AC60CCCC1B4C1CFB5F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xA489D504139D8DEB61AC1374A1ED27E4
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x30851E379B0ABA940E79FDD8C39AC7CD
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0xBD454D43F57B8EE74FE77B154992B3D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0xDF2F4753AE65F536AD6DEF6482E5D0F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0xEBE75987A19C9EFDB3A63D97ACD5EECB
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x58D67D17D00C012930B80E1AD18FA8D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0xC2536415DBAC18AC7639128D24D5D971
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0x3639ED67911B8D82EAD65EC5FD9C17EE
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0x2A0509E90AC8095AD4C43B01EE15E706
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0x19255855171BBB48CCC2A927FB279A82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0x881EDA549B2B3A049CD557B1B5E04654
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0xA0EBD53258A4899437B2814D264817B1
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x424CC2BC3AC782E9546C752CFB556FC4
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x04C7FE633C5BB0D65093E051EC45D10E
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xDDD5FE1B9A40F1652A49DA33654866B0
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x3DAAD4EBD2A23E72BA0814463C6363BC
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0xC786FB0A114BC69E0F7D8DE0725464C2
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xEA282E1AC6D42B13A563F60899A90767
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x577C70D454C078A6DA37821ACA2F6A61
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0x79469C0AC3E6DA2088B1024EF3CF456C
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x552A88D27A197697422B4F671F48FE41
effect--
0xB3F63B61AF73B695234F2B06BF8DAED9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0x42F503CAD64C541F47689E77E31B8EB1
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xD9F6A7CC30B7E6639014FB0F0999F820
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x176C7BE5FAFBF095444918D80AE6E8B7
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x50B444DAEBF2EBB807F15FC096DD72BF
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0xB77F2516533EABB7592E9994B5F23CDB
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0xF4153BA4DDE06F322FA34D8066D0EDD9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0x8F21AE1171BD0559983DD0B53D8F42B1
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x25A3A1C76011AD9F43B2DFEE574C528F
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0xFE3EE6276AF4208387EB7188EB5386EE
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0x1DD850194F267789834180628943B059
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0x6082261F1F7BBE22EF784F893C3E0EF4
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x33A5981206015E4B8B4E647628E96C40
again."
0x4370501D4370501DF7ED5FEF3FC0297F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0xD5A77DCF1D5E0AD1CCFBD6B2819957AD
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0xBE34E5F1CF8302EFDA386D4D83921585
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0x757E227A3E55D6CAC463FA1073FF9190
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x0196172F80C98FA12D452B8F1C1AFED2
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x14875CB048F8A4F3121494D30471D05D
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0x22064ED9928135D3075D52B924AEACE7
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x4F0673F08C63575CA0CA684BAE1AA1BD
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x157C94B5CBBED9FA62BD8CBEC7EA4046

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x6D21DA5C411CCFC90D458B05B306085A
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x2EAF6BFB35266086B944E2C3AE064019
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0xD09C53280743F28FDD5C8DCA49B4844B
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0xADDB294CB5FBF6A8BF8F83980A77C425
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x9CD895B895D980CD957066181D1B1182
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xFA90997C2C1380C4147C287E8FA0FEE7
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x550BF06300BD232ACA1D4FB5BB42F53C
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0xCE61411C8F75B15D6B0D6DD7F4BF42D8
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0xC8FFD9F250A3849BF8FCC0DB2FFE7534
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0xC85AB55FD8D2027348743453DFA46A59
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x70981B412BE58DCD7F1ECF4D7005F290
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0xD7C2C36E710A0B0E85259CBB6F8B6AD4
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0xDAFD1A4B819CE6E33058FC946D411E2C
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xD08D58B5742ABE119AC3994A0CBFC334

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0x3401D714DEF25ECAE87FD1045882855F
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0xF1AC4AB1971A079A493F473992C7023F
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0xB1A38001AAB70490A7E8C3B184EE5862
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0x8D605799175BD50355158ACB63A20760
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0xA8F87695871F18B6AD116D15F2DE6DE0
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0xDF5EFC47628218362287FD78F16491E7
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0x45857E021F01C7DB371E02A5289C8004
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0xFA81C0C652E0DC2112F97CE35401A6C2
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x60F77D0B5F829CE45642E597939382E2
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x73A4D23D2387BE9507A67F0597D54A56
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x6885AF0EBE0E52CFC538774E946B504E
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x2BC788822FA9ECEAE9F36660363906B7
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0xF7BA4B66E2F13CCB8B9C4CA734710BEB
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x815DAFFD93828D802A200DBF8E1ECC82
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0x55993A1F293B16469D70CACA1A8F6F70
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0xDF35BCCC162BD249626A8FB1F774DC71
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0xF5C6E6DA47F24D23652236BA2E2BF0BC
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0xCF7C03DA1CE231B3F6147CDAAEB9F1FC
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0x14224B0F00AE234BA098D5E5DAF696E3
passionate pressure.
0xFCB6764EEEAA03ADDAF8F6DA3A40EC53

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x0E06D97E2955AB1D0A524A9D2E62A18D
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0x6FB4766B68084863FB66CD9B1A43DF2E
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x475CE08848CC0B40E3F42DC1EA8744B6
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x7F581265774C5CD6C1B599EACC9D43EE
satin."
0x90E4EF1F90E4EF1FBF0CF313A183BF86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0xC7099512BCB3F0563C619A2657EA0A68
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0xDBE77F009401CA5986F7E031BC187EBF
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x5379C6CF551296E2361587B428EEAA0C
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0x56FA83FB338FD1AD732142A1214D1D19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0x9F429CDC51ECE2F47FC2FF769CA6D2C2
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0x3B8608716568DF711F0AB6A38235E19B
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0x0FCE32993DBFB8A08ED5548BA0B6A4A5
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
0x36AE83EA86BB9AE7D0AACEB384295A81
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
0x834A8D4F2867B85A1FFA758012D50535
satisfactorily here."
0x7D5D53D59526CE2F0FE3CC06FF5FF3F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0x07D0B1E08ADCBA92398CECFE315CB403
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0x1584FD163F9AFA0D933B32F84262FAD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0x93B503EC5C5B439DCC182AC6CEA0A8E8
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0x12223F218D58B9CA540CF76E04C2A331
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0xA887CF81A99FBF02A38C5714FF4497E6
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
0xAD5BD52A43348ECA7A06B67D3F0E3139
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
0xBCABAA0448715F19A71EDF29368DCC2D
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
0x7B74D26BD497BDAD4DFF2E4D232D258E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0xEB8191C9D34E170CAD539C2E360F4F98
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x5906DC4D3075697D09F3C1111492D4B6
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0x63503A03E6C5437CD1624C77D0F3EC92
would be to violate its conditions."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0x23CD64BFFEC8E651378931A1C0B4820C
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0xD7A4C287AA379F479395180B16F9BF9D
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"

you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the

shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board

and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own

"Well, but what?"
0x44C77136B6D039ECC5AC9E6F0927E46F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your

equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0xA11F5AEE0EB822FEF7E23EBB377B2C00
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xEEF00D076F5E385AF44E00955DBFFF06

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

till--"
0xE74BF318E74BF318B30E54FD00AB2095

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
0xC4C5A1782BED6455F951F180B5E2C763
usual for another month."

it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0xAE4EEBC25C773621DD68A8EBD940BC6B
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0xC8BC6C3758CCC0CD044DE1BD702E13AF
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0x84A91E0D5AF6F8E97A20D49BED7718DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0x29A2278B5FA3F50135807A915694142E
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I

have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0xC04E1E6087EED944E971840D528E4EFF
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when

once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x42B8FD1B2CA04C522E5A90A5D33B70C8
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0xB4D12F31DD1B7C2A4E8C2A36473B7816
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0xC8EE4F002495DDFDB3CCFE704200746B
my jewel I should tyne."
0xF6B44B22C69FD944C8EB4506D372A4A1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0xD915F26CF85B034E9895CB72413C8498
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x9D11DC5AE4A37EDDDD82FDB699ED13F0
retreat upstairs.
0x0A5CE161678261F8BA2646DC507C380E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x1B2A2103111F96215EB60E0C9D9D95AE
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0xFAB5CB9B625FC93E0800690197D50EA3
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0x6FB10B462BF0C2FD214920F748465993
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x1CE25C9AF5668F01FFDD571AAFA617C7
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0xA63D6927E02CFF32027963739727D412
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0x336BED6F8EE7F713A5128B64883A5AD5
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0x9D80740410322C470FE1ECC3D27ACDCE
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0xB645592F4A75FB164622A533CEE838C2
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0xBB0F135AEA6412475D772C7EF7B7684E
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0x9EEC7A42E27AF1F1B14A96288466299F
the present.
0xAE28AFCDF1AC8478953BC3AB9F78C614

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x4679F9DA4EA70CFC17BB1EAF9B4F23A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x1351E32CCC240B9374515ECF83AC3C12
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xB3718D23C50A9AC631F174D2AC3E811A
stimulate it.
0x7F9F6CB34B8C7CC46AA5006743473AF9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0xB2EB6F1930B05B0ABB7933CC6CDF814C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0x034A1B7C5013551CD9C2B2EEE13C3F9B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0xECCDA6CD7AADAA0D935AD1FAD915BB6D
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0xF7D6B17505DC473B8DE2AB75117E0F90
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0xDD51F1CA80CA4A14F95909EB71108DF3
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0xC3634419C94E200E2039D10701162632
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0x72B87E9730657F80B0DDDBCF1B73AF4A
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0x8A5CF692395A5FA3313B76E47D88C178
strain:--
0x4AB3FFA9A94DCAEF4C63D5198F031E73

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x836AC3685ECD7982AA71D56A58E46C74
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x82B57D0776B2FFDDB15A956BEF7E1741
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0xBD8D531D61B7C7C15F3912F38C90331D
      The tide of being pour.
0x0CAE36F1A3F46FA819CC317544643D15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0x2F7D4EF62FBC15CDFD3BCB4002B4D45C
      Her parting was my pain;
0x19700BC07766D8E4B4F4E19964F9B408
   The chance that did her steps delay
0x2494F12BB21113759C2D71F55FC9B22F
      Was ice in every vein.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,

      As I loved, loved to be;
0x96E92A1992AE42E5729A7CCEAEEFF66C
   And to this object did I press
0xB7B5861904A0B548D2D84B532EE74EDD
      As blind as eagerly.
0xA478A496FC5FD50E550963A3DF691753

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   But wide as pathless was the space
0x126089CA902BEF5BE22AE3DAA0212158
      That lay our lives between,
0x5DFA0AB9E20B2A8251C609E7326A9D89
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0x1D3611011CD3CC15EC750C875DAD61BE
      Of ocean-surges green.
0x033F66700110ABE20C4679C7030DC5E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   And haunted as a robber-path
0x4FA7989A3B19ACAC50D10A638BEF2DAC
      Through wilderness or wood;
0x61B64180FE0764B81C03F91328478092
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0x6EFD6ABC45F001F430022271BFB9979D
      Between our spirits stood.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0xA7675FAD9C9435A14BCAD40B29A3AD66
      I omens did defy:
0x1724F361C144F1BE47411BEE70E5EB00
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0xB098165B68AD90BBA7C86AFC3D358866
      I passed impetuous by.
0xB29BD2D9EA578D4AC0132D00743CBDE2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x9579C1B110C19FE35249A46AC241862B
      I flew as in a dream;
0x74B0B32A766AA74D635AC7EC374E34F9
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0x4248BB95E160B393E58E35217FD6B2D9
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0xCDA84376EACDA283FD373B38E9EF3B68

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0xA7ECB761A6FE5D04D5391D1BC1303CE7
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x0E9B95C16714FD15C652EFD59CAA4161
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0xFCAFAE18A0C37602EA687015D3B8D796
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x72503BC92FD2468A8AEBC09E3B9FC97E

   I care not in this moment sweet,
0x27B0ECA2EA7FAFD64B8CDCF4A6BECB9C
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x1C4E8716F6B4208F70D09B4761865B71
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0x9452BC9172245A1B767A77303C5B13F6
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:

      Right, bar approach to me,
0x667D05F79425BDBC4BFED26AD9D647C4
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x1A2B8FBC17CF3B3FDCB216B71FC9ABC6
      Swear endless enmity.
0xE024FF8EF5471CF940B5CFCD4622F307

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   My love has placed her little hand
0x4A2178072E1C5B52BDBBCF4BB6140A8B
      With noble faith in mine,
0x66D6AFC78B593CE4C6E0F6F4E48FA07C
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0xF1202489C3E5C87BF7EC29E1B644F42B
      Our nature shall entwine.
0x6BA51DE379E818568AE33C78A5153AE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x580FA104829CA7A7D1080791E20CA626
      With me to live--to die;
0xF5654A292B6FFE083E5448C6C8091A50
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0xBE95ECA9202E5AC6619D1A47CE766711
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x942EC73B1C026144007FB74FF98CE3DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0xDEA80E62EE9A5EC9C8FCFF732BE7C1A3
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0xA3E18C40577B1CD2D205BC9FFAAADFDF
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x8CD3B0AF1778789B20272F0BFC70C5AD
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0x0DB7210D0CC76D3BB0B55EA7B48E21E7
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0xC3568D36E257F60595C304B16EEFE371
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0xE237C3D0DA038E80C0CADA9FEE5B2F86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x3EFD407D5CD98C8C968BDDF9CF2C290A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0x0652A76C6C6FAC0852B2823A8BB8AD49
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0xB34FA5470AAE6424381DFC17C24941F5
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xDDFD6249E7572C1EA019546659D5A9CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0x3F6D094D63F70C40E9B1F7E5DED2992E
Death was not for such as I."
0x9CEEFC4FE27F32285D5CCC24EC2C696A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x90882CD12B851FFA77DAA8DD43696095
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x3AECF4D8A04B95C38E64AC364475AAA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0x14E0E0C8B4B86C2A8933123994B04C51
reconciling kiss?"
0x668E92D32CE86B7F9A1FD28059A4360F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No: I would rather be excused."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x096BCBDF0136DCD2B5F47D85BE2E5105
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0x0D4D196F3A5895F51BC4B2BAD9D0BE6F
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x76DE8A3726A58B3508EA35C0439006E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0x7948C7815ACBFF4FA55CAD7C5E34B1F0
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0xD251F955A8E54DB62C4DC92910038B0E
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x13C63D3FCD94EC07F12217DFB6C5E6BF
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xA6FE627B7BA5B977C44537CCCBC3F210
time to rescind it.
0x92CB2B97C7F16A99EDCC385D60A7D9D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x23E5315884BA999130D2131ACFBDD64F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0x89261C73F841567E20E142C79E3AE0DA
myself I was doing that now."
0x3EB3AB590BCEF85C8AF3F5ECE834D7B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x97D8557C4B13AE77247278AA52E4988A
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0xA5AFCEF0846717C8C33AEFF699F97B97
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x4E3AC5AF7430C969D0AFE16D4515AFF2
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0xF108B3DFF8A8EEC04BC1C9028171B5A1
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x9367871AEDFC1EFDA6D461C9CF6791A1
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x1CF6AE773BCFE76AAAEA7BC47ABC6C9A
advantage."
0x50D04E4AC7748B7B2DEAD695F515207A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xEE0FEE186B6AE9BA4E2E6966C1030D91
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x3D9FAFD00EF4689A391CD68CD3549AA1
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x319C32144CFEAD6C611339D6F260AC75
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x220052F48ECC36134ED1ED2B85CA4417

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xB2C60B8A6E1745E007F16D85E83F1E1B
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0xA530778C9D5105E8F81E669B9D8EC5DE
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x8F6A7A25869C5D3F1BA8319EB5AF1878
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0x19E3BA45FF888FB5B9DE2FDFFD4E50F9
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0xD16DF18EF0F9C757B9D794F59E06BC8F
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0xAC8486038D8970B84B66B932DE15EFBC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0xCC5C387E881F2EEEF67D108B7A487301
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0x1A994E8A6B95D0E09B458000636A151D
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0x0ADEF0E8257A12AED58B478F4BBB67C3
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0xD7B94A3E83884FFB870A76B90570209B
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x8D6650CBA9FD9C03DD56CCE5B15D4B6D
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x438B72772F64A85840C449380C5BCA73
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0xEA2F9236102398CADF19E665D48C249A
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0x10C90FC680B1EE074A4606EDC7AEE884
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0xB109AC4202BE983FE9DFBF5DAFF18D18
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xD2754D30E74C9C1568F25618C01ABB75
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x04DD28D96B7FFAB6A3FB9A2F5691641A
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0xAC3420DC336AAAFC4FA5E306A8CB637C
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0xA1219F57B110E97FD7B545664ACC9A83
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0xE284CCBCE819DAE528EF73CDEE8C2F86
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x864742C0DA6FE518564F70F242458D14
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0xE24A05634354D1A24A363801F5E54F81
virtue, another must be devised."
0x589C10FB3F9893981B400CB13332C119

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xACAED82F1D58AB626878E27C5C9ED6C1
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x70D013904BCF4344F625904145C713BA
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xD77ED31DDC4F09539D0E8D8873368E7D
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0xB4BEAFD6989AEA67CED78ABADE5AB867
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x2D77D8B84D4864CC2C2D7963FD2BBCB6
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x079C5DE256E6DFC7763DBEA3E2D5EB6E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0xA92F76C5034C7CA6BAF848B11D6AAC9E
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x92912C560D43694A27C56A420FCF21A2
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0xDA73B0FFD646A2FDEC978B1C6BE396B3
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x04DBFC33818671FA4DDC6A02C33C7149
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0x9CFBC65A501505C59BF9530F0BC6D06F
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0x7CF95F19F17EB355E4ED4ED34C2463C5
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xAD596A42580B2327163ADDE7E6E6FFFB
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x4D0C1A43F216AFDE4B8A053BEA8BE052
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x50BAAA9EC567F0399A963CDEDA41B0A6
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0xEFE0E65568D7BA0B25F5B5A249ECCDF8
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0x58538CAF4CDF69D6C93C3AF403B71839
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x15C2AE7C9A325716051A4BFD8E81190A
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0x59170E8E012D740B64DD1D4A7452DF61
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0xC25FC3F700135D88DF829B91E9168B72
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0xAEA8DE5B13DD6CE59ED0BCDA39F10946
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0x37BF4F243413A79601D5077A046A5B4C
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0x33EE14FFF547639563D35859B8D2DE78
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0x22F269676136E5B0226B1747DA487F28
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x2E65942552C95DD670AF21F2266C62EC
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0xA00E84A81D549FF19A3D6B1810E64CFC
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0x305363C2000AA24ABDE200282B6A20A4
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x2C4CDDE02060565701D453FBC42390D3
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x7497FA1561DFA40FA5432A28A4652821

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0x0969123A7EF6213DC4E20FF64D0EB06E
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x624031CFC881658175351C69C66DAADE
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0x3C1BAFC3C27533F52BC35AC8D3D4372D
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x520DF5191D40610DA0F1D09CE4030517
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0xEA8FD383D009B5CF9DE67757B67AE0EB
more than they.
0x89C4D14A7352E4E886B3D36B70F287ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x2803B7DF27872A02594E0EFD8141294E
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0xE691D6C3935EFD781559BD05312DEE72
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x9E9FBC5E2F2AEC1CB13A79BCB0E7B260
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xC6E470935C39134F9FDF78B38292DFF6
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0xE022A0C25900E2D1FFC17E69A4E76311
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x0C2F07BBBB8CD031AB84DBE667A53657
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x1253FCEA8762E0168BE08D8F8876CF5C
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0xF48CE0E5EE767F92A00E25D43E87BEC8
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x7AFE3A8360A0509B56EF0916FC2218D5

I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xDB28D1427FBAC9CCB666FF5058C0A9EC
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0xFFE2AFB952C867F279D86F461CA4EDDC
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0xF556B8B80D9B1841AA6C0175D28DD090
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0x9C89A732C44512BF98D4C90F00EF082D
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xCE32B79FBACFD0DE30D3F41A28258869
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x2F407B261261F5F8B1841BABC5EBAC04
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0x20C856D1793BCDA55CE2A401F35AA72D
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0x3A8B698F804A6DEE3505FA68998BBF0D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0xB26C0EA437D29070F48DF273E8AFF224
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0xE74404C9741BCE20E41A5C0BCC24F452
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x7B9B841C11513EE6B7D56F7F6C972E59
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x2E51768C7580F838E0F699B285D9B704
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0x807BAE8DE089345147FB8029BF919A72
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xC3655FCF6FD4B9218EBD9CB122EE7D7B
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x77955411D9F5BFFFADBFE527A0E83002
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x534FA0656C37E2AC271AA1BC8169A9BC
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x657A8A9B85DDC67744DDFEEA815B28C7
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x4EBD97AB72E23859AB29E19E8ECCD0C8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0x2E65AFD93AB3D2236F534B11B052238E
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x2989CD09167866F79E95FF29D8C70503
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0x5B9BBBACA8FD7B8558F01ACF56340CBC
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x3ED380C4261BE5F674CE7857112E90A6
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0xB5ED19F78C85DCF898A3D538E2E1C45D
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x2EA89259564FB71489FC52F92B6FC132
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0xE42C0E9C5A4875E2F569AD2E3DA41390
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0xC6BDBFC62A28C5D58D837F2C813C4480
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0xCE40B84FAE19222E451A0BD5B7187511
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xAEC49597DD94D42D07014F90FA7D0A13
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0x84C44CFAAE4069E088F42FB2240F1ACC
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0x0CED04A3A2930F6C68FA721CCCCE6790
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0xACE88D3FB3EA9DF9FB492677630F0E51
listen to, and I ran off again.
0xC8C0F4B0492E1446AB9A784C17814743

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0x1F2868F3DADF43775FCD422FD4BA972D
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0x2C19290F525E3BFAA8526EFC7A01E490
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x1661575DE4553EA8EF81E362228220C9
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0xC7D3B03D5DD9472D989629F8DD3EF9D8
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0xD7EC439EE44D6EAC4A8168CE2A42476A
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x969121E744F70A73747A913AFFA81671
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0xF92355468D5E9CE90CC5687790AB8026
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x4586D18E7FCFDCBE4C2C665D556FBCCF
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x212B669E91301B6F999535FC904AC21B
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0x912A498C9105C7D03035BDD465B68BDC
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0xE18FDE4C41047A2BA717AB154A8B7A06
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x54EA2AFDAB9008982E6910C471CE9D7B
simultaneously struck ten.
0x3CD60E7CAD6AC255235EABB1C3356313

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0x82B69D4A3ABF5E617C16B438C1F3C111
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x2E936F5EA9245210DCE3CF73B0D36F16
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x32D84BEEBB46314D82EA4F9470BC06A4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0xD3013B707040827AA3415CEA58BF77FD
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0x029EEFE340B7AB98B00BB5F46C1DAFCF
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0x1F538096D72B111DF1D055023FBBEEB5
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x5522EB8A9AAA5E2FD1B7EF931F832AE1
by one moving speck.
0xE86DC95BF376FCDB632B18A5B31CE8D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0x650B1B00FD31A2F27A8B9DBC8EE58262
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0x26528EB00DA460A98D7BCC2C3BDC050D
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x426FE1B1540DD34208714A19282B0B09
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x61E222E1EC16935FB6188FF42893D49D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x15008FEC19691B72A055585A5EA77D82
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xB642DAF40473E35331C9F5A2EED267C3
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0x64E4587BEBC9429DD3BF424911E354D2
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x8E877C43C9878646552E6A9BE4BDCB19
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0x28DB4AF60C1B9F912C7E0E2708F24A97
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x0E9CF89F8B25E77D3D1F935D6E78A425
meridian, and must now decline.
0x5FB06D8050407738D4425D49A6DCAC1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x666F826A6A50FB38A9E620584A12656C
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x0DCFE6FF7E9524A3CEE0E66A7CAEA9CE
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xF00CBD4CDEA1897316FF5E0137293856

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x1EF36EE43469785FDDBE0F4569748BF6
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xF0F8A13F470ACB4CA98F81A33A7A5E22
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0x54071AB08254F7E66D8A811FB3085B8D
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0xDAC7F9A05AA965B283541D0A677A5B87
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x437E329DD0988471DADE24845F40B1FF
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0x5BC3FCEB4F2083BB48B9544EB34321FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0xC56E93B3622DAAE5D88E9D209A1591C8
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x300D5DDDFB316AB4CF1924166319DE5E
give me both hands: mount!"
0x8D5EDB5F7E8FA69901384798C9A5FF8A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0xB19AC16ED868F029FAA3578A43A4EE68
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0xE7797C7D01904170F918EFC7C23E3920
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x46F9879EA24753BD294C341E6CC6BF3C
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x1ED6C832DAEB7F65FB77CA33D59D0B52
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x09E4A8203E91CD7977D9876731AE555D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0xC003D20ACBF74592A4BCB0BDF1003E0C
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x743A523900BBCFBC8D465D9A30828B05

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x7815EFB48CB41693EC014C1DEF10C2BC
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0xA85545092E4239DC3225744808A56F3E
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x74CB416864A927DD82998A52F62D2831

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0x2FEA82F3A239D3DBB047AA508834B259

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you have been both?"
0xF4608C58D9DE13FFEF64FBDC8EA4BD2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0xD9C28B28464E8B9DAE0E45598A7B0A02
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0x8B8DDD71B9D6315F47AE3A0FD59806B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x5E7144A4245B857E66DD55E70788BC10
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0xCC55E124DF5A9A27D33676723D613603
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0x6F3C0863FC93032F4627B32C07B5D6E7
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0x159A5FC410C18D6D27F348B60D16F2B3
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0x5F114916B05C0ACF2308E8A4F2FD664A
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x78499FF60F8C5A084919C80AB45F2356

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0x0615118A26C803964D6E287715ABCA4A
get down."
0xBBC64C6FEA91875D385786AB47D7345E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x4D9254DBDAAC34E2BD4F82A3524DC0A5
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0x21AAC2C394DA14932A0B17D6B3EBDB18
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0x125B129150AC92179083FCD3A5DD8B5E
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0xA98E4E99DF5219E2932672360A07021D
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x0D243B26244561BC3B6192658E80073C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0xD35FAB81C0CABF0E5D2A8E42B9F0A1AA
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0xCAB1D58A5E7A9134CB047CF2425D3E0A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0x5BAF1FB313C63508086842E8618D9126
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0xB0E9E1C01A4880F59E9DA589CD4F2FE2
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xD06730BC17A224263C47759469C00825

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0x5712D8DFFF7297A5135A9F3A9C42168E
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0x52BFCFE6653497450FCDCFA3D48B705E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x46630F5BC054ED47767590133E540DCB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x351E23717AF5D03983F3537602C6EB52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0xEE0AC1C31AE4F5988C70AAE642D1F072
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0xF8678C844BEC0BEDDF4738E89632F4EA
as a long, strong arm.
0x0EBAA274CF0CE41404189B57F1461C49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0x4176F3FA78C61F248D27F5BF7042A440
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0x5B065AF45F3305387903D7D8BFFC6F2F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Jane."
0xB10B3EDB1AF4B1BBB65BF1E358BD550B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x3C941AC9769F4FD3C49270AB3B569710
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0xEE414888F46491E311C963B995AF3E0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x94132C262B18E180D477A91E99C1FB17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0xC95A43326DD2AAC22851B7A0983DAA55
my wedding."
0x95E98A3C495A0147E65C96CC01C88219

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0x9F4721BAA8B9FB5F3EEE23D7991A58A0
no wish to go to bed."
0xC7F212289F305B5AC36B13C91ADE4DFB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0xB8D64033DA6ECA3D62F721931402E342

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All, sir."
0x6837F801B79EF2F8DCC913FBE0365FF6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xE5BAF58C601FCA28B72959A953F3184F
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0xA10B213D2E186D588E24EE112459A72C
from church."
0x347E3B7EAFF8280E2D5934EFFDE59C09

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very well, sir."
0x52351B71D20C3AF0403FCAA955AB1C8A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0x1A8AE97BA7E07DC8CD743E5FCF1C43DF
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0x8265F43DE3AA171350DCD6DC0A532D50
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xA7C4B2CD046278A94C83A387BAA1E17D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or

over-fatigued."

I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xFBE69C0B635E7FEA6D3D57715E42ECA0
and flushed.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xB99515D2AFD2CBFAA991D64ED736A987
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xA54EDE3CAB4A6AC6A391856E8796EF4B
I shall not prove a good husband?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the

new life into which you are passing?"
0xF1D82E7EE4E4FCF0DC0D68E736811AB0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0xBD605B9FCAD67D841CE545A43FC494DB
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x1E0DB5ADC94AFF8BCE97198A9D74816D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x2C4C78B186CCA80C029EB94C0AA2C3EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x45B288D79BBF761A463843723648DFF1
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0xFA0F694CF9AD52012435B26E1F069229
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x757E8A44FB8C351831D64C3681383146
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x1B22153E6E41ACEF3756499B7497FE06
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0xF22C421AA22D3F4DA06766143F7B6864
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x75159DE9CAE3AC4FDC869A84C7F426DB
proceeded.
0x81F61A92E6F5A18F42AEF89B62125BFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x1C8FED2204DEB764AB1B1550564746DB
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x18D68004E8FF6EDD787927C6D9284A2C
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x9F54F6A613F0D0F335266FA41D6AAEB8
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xE0523C0B03D0DF4364FD3466CCD0B1C4
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x079FF2B8D61EFACB006747A9918A5B97
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x55DFC53925E2688C4209B2EECAA9B30A
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0xA8FF8CC9173957FDC87D8474B1BC6958
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x6FECBA29A0F0D6F3F6333D18555EA3A5
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xE0B9762F17B318E395A37C25B144DEE1
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x63C601A3B30C7CD8947288C28512BD9C
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0x036D894E38EEA39202641157236F1637
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x06A5862A45FA3FBCA2BC0FC1CFA68434
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x1F207808A7CCFF48682FE43257AD74A9
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0x2528B1BBC97060D4ADDF6265BE00E805
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x6F006536E12FE7DD8C71DAD0760983CD
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x2EB7E5A52042B60A69970DA360A8C60F
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xB514AAC8778365049BFE7CEA7BA82F49
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x1646FC6648B8F358086C343C8C8FF987
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0xD08EEA906508ECDC76F1BC581492DB06
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x6C4600D1EA2D6D0EC2FE5E5E991E9565
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x83012291726E69429D50C4A95DE36E27
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x85E2D0F5FA12D771597C320D500B490E
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x1BA3B22FD508B4EFA905366FC79A896F
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xC5740BEF98F48C1195F74044E2F81730
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0xD23CB90EAC9C59F6E348F95F21B3B4AF
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x19A21391239F9BDD97377FA16C344784
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0x3D23C1BC102F227C4CCC6FC8C0728F97
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x1983FA19D7A887FE4278B2C78D86E537
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x7E858DF8F32DCABDDAFF602229A84552
coronet."
0x701832CCC513D510D60AFD5CC3E253A6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0xAB1AAE91D1A82B361BECBA051B34D233
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x7E2A4FB1D8F34B490567D9684E348797
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x826BCBD3D4DAB626DE4035C23989A366

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0xF80E398AE85F9905A7A0D330D78047BA
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0x55414D9FAEAECCBD24035D5A212C9547
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0x2824B3814E3AC9E570FEDEAA0BA63E13
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0x7E2302C9A73440933DEC442F053007CF
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x637DF4732C6EA066F675E13AC7246922
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0x5624DD605BC20091D324FFAED14D1718
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x6EA0508C2B9979DBE0FD9A585D82FAE7
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0xEA5582AE42FCF0292874F8AD46A69CEE
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0x28E42C3956BF1600336F64B47EEBE21B
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0xA7B2DA253B7C13A6EAA12C79542FF504
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0xE314480917AF4F53E7B83AE774B07B90
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xA69FB220694A1D0C10B2BBD7B9705147
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x6B155ED63EF057AA46889D221EC70124
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0xDA46CB20CD2C4E42E3058702B8AD7CBD
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x18ADEB109BD7836C1A5C309A084146D8
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xEBCB4F7AAD424C23FE97F35A31833D89
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0xDAB88AA420264ED9349A0967329C4A80
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x5DD1B6A63797F458E2DDD37E7A5C6A3A
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0x2101159D7FAF3492517D9623E94FB422
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xE77BB67AC61E173E5561E93AC14059C0
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x5BB664350ECD049E05580415C825DF05
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x089490F6149DA7F94898CC5393764C89
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0x223C719D7838594F28F7B357FE27B773
moment."
0x57FD4342E5B2EFE1C08A76B390198DB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0x169772D4986E53DFC3EE3D8E4CD962D5
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0xB07D6CBE3CC1A83463CA1C394ABA8FE2
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xEB4DAF55C2CCA8642D09BF4F89A66C3A
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xA9785ED66587CC2076890EC76D9C7225
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0xC3B8932F9A4CA872FF12E71631FE206C
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x1E0E0B89E52448D84C2D9416DDBFA564
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
0xC6E3664DC0F414C53AA18C533CCA9FD8
Jane?--repeat it."
0x4F10F7762CB799F0DAE7367D37976045

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0xCDEACAF176D8F70C7F7CC5AF91116056
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x8B7BF56E451A26486D701E2628B3921E
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0xC1BBE55B7D78286ADA497D6DD10AC68D
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x28E414D0E03FB539F2A0055BA5370C03
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x15792A9A02109286F11D981521C4B249
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0x66875F602D502E0B1CCB2E23FC6515EB
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0x25ABBB8540D250812B6CD646C0AE8797
incensed than saddened."
0xD29EAFF14A5D33EF30565205BE430AD7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
0x832479FD299EF277F6AE74261FDA8A36
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
0xBBAC5ECE4A9DE6ABA58E44A91A690339

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
0xBE1C89E4A861AEB34C41B3BE591C8491
of your melancholy in a dream."
0x811EC11AA7C8AE7F6285B42243537879

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0xFF0D06FE9712D6F6C324FC7AA2A8532E
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
0xE82FC8916F21DC5F62FCF1CB9E341565

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0xBE7B827DD910DDB8145D834DEB0140D0
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x15CB19B9D5DC59E3B232A9D674E73CDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x5BFC795309D2DAD405D1327CB11B0A32
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x7DC9F8A721500F147224DD8135445C3C
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x2029F887F28DBA826AF6C7E9FAFB98B7
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x39F23B072172F8F51C35BCDAD636F8C3
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0xB865D0C0DD610AEF4D19A12747B614DC
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x999FE6406A8DD9947B724381731689A5
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x98A1AC3B3F3B07FB18BAA322572F0677
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x04594BD66237380347199470B19728AB
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x11A3AD83519BAA8FA7B9A0221FAD8749
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0xFD7298C38A3F74CC98EC4254A8718020
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x68434047748B67223EAC56AA2C0F7184
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x79F50D6E59727C0940794BF38153FF12
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0xDAB990E5C127595BD95DA536D2553B53
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x793CE340810193C6A750F80D779A8082
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x3C7FBF3FA80C04DE5D254B7D87F31867
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0x59F6222BF257CB7082DAE9A7824597F3
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x99DF039BC3D91E9B6FEA62801C3941B5
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xAD2B19EB6E7C04A81491A7C29F289189
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0x54653FE6E0BFEA8923612DB378A96128
woke."
0x99CD8AD599CD8AD54C9884B6B26EC220

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, Jane, that is all."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0xA0312ECC68B2443DB4B5774D60043B7D
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0x05D51A8F41EF36EDA6A2037D563B64C8
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x15EA1021D57F019608CDB74864AB4B5C
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x9451858A964881F67E2C8EB4C02CB60C
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x6DBD33865D011BE2CE869F2BC10FD881
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0xF287D4E60AC37943B6E2A85FCCD69AB2
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0x31012E18A083B8EFFFCBD5F14D8BB884
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0x50A4FB758538F138601B5DE651298E18
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x39218F36788E28C200203622A8192359
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x4B089F319524A215B6B5D5D4DE4B4054
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x3081A0C0210D5797081C42BA54BA0300
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0xC545E184476C3E282B76964356981636
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0xBD1E6E3F26904B79993581822C97FC54
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0xB147EB64AFC12851796F1CC29A6274CC
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0xFD1B5C8738831C1B89899619FB405CDA

"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
0x6CCD89FDC41A7884776536D1BD899D4C
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x207D56E7035298B1A937D4567F815904
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x9B83DEC68704D85868FBCD5D484DBE4F
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xB95E5FD86257BAD33559BB46CA5E6EDE
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0x2FD3EC8C17175C93E5F5153DDC54746E
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."

0x82F7299573F1D4BBD6173DBB47E3AEE1
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x8D7B0EA469FA98583159E86C39F024F2
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"

0x5762DA2645CDCA91F40F6482876B249A
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0x8284C446A97E2B4A5994481849F2B068
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0x4ECB3CABD21441F684BA20608298A895
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0x1D3286ADAF7E26B9A0F1B050DC455388
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for

"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0xB044DB24B5CFE18857DEF73AEEF698C6
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0x1B9FA1C505FB25C6A5FA3F8CD3B250F5
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,

wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the

mystery of that awful visitant."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0xE30D9AFA141A8C7BC2D13A5D78E94BFC
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x243F958C8B12D5CD084329F05B35686A
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0xCA45736629FE379B4C7BCB2527D916CE
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0xF40CE2F8885C73AD46D2EE9EFF56A274
to bottom in two halves!"
0x47AC8EEEE94BB88EF63030F37F6E57B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0xF2AB0857488FA2760DF1D7D2D855E6CE
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x8A69DA2D8308F81224D2DD8055BE3B67
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0xE9C16BF4BB385B3B78AE4E51AC7D26DD
might have happened!"
0xDC50A727521675878E3002DC28E976BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0x7A92C8D1C323CE3B998E59DFDA2C5983
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0xCC0EAA584F1DFDD91D9008D17AF7AF46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x1246EE9BE1C69FC7A72590A5BA9FD435
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x4B0507F3C10F6A8945D5EC8984FD7C9E
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0xE8F87CE0711EA787E45FA20B056EFEFA
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xA6B851AA674FFE1A3C1678F25F2AD2E9
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0xD9A426611B3F425439EAD2E41E7C73F7
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0x68C9DFD691BBF23F101313566B3A3C49
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0xDFCABBE648F1E5A65ABC949C5A7C4C8D
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x8CB7F6E939E56822401F1555990E4295
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xF03336B6C7435F13DB6C7099E2EAF3BA
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0xF752CE3F035A7F09E10224BA2A08F27E
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0x7A75331EA5468371BCB2810BF4E7889B
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0xD8C5A4189619CBD996059CAF6E494F97
solution of the mystery?"
0xC71D0E48E6A481F930204B639F42804A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0x8D18201A5CCF796BFBED2BFB7F648E1E
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x0FAAB3A30133381745375D234EFAC9F9
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x5F89B65718CD7DA336C25AFB6E4451DF
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x4E3989798233A422C18DC3D2AEFC8B3E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0x1A21D494FB94EE4475C4AB86E668CBE3
candle.
0xE832CB49E832CB49DA1D4394AADBDF5C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0x8C9D8E6415C06EEB284D6536BA594A11
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0x08F7B00E0409B10392BD7CBA920295B0
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0xD128E968D0E59296B87233A41764DE7F
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x34DB0144029DEB15D8FD261DA326EA28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0x093D7DE448E877C8F503EA416CA82C77

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0x007FC8C249E8D7C78D0F33D1645E418F
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0xF6F5FBE4AABC9AA610AB9F64104BDF48
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xED45405A0DB64F982F6795211561B5FC
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xD47D580DA3BEAA8BAA4D46938C689B63
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0x1F2A51675AE1E2F9CB19A443A4A8FE2B
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0x1DF8676735B5AC52239C633C9B98E44F
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0xD2B6A6BDDAC574E5E118E712A5E24EBD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0xD1DEEBD0DAB6F8868EA276252FA1C1C5
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0x0A171594829131AB5FB4D4DDC70E792E
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0xBFBDFA651960C4AE77D53D2634E24362

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0x19F50B7C55CC17CFBC72B42743B77C98
Janet now?"
0x15DA2A1FAB85A12477D1E369A409F540

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x5C25D07CCF2689E7D78EF132835233DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0x180A0E7FFAA06F33A4E200967824EF94
love and blissful union."
0x86DBA63A73B85709F689850709397401

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x1560CE5302FF64F02209ACC587A7176C
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xE5EC60E96868A9D80A11A73FC11339FE
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x010DD3B77F37B3962103E3ADA71BA7A4
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0x6D8DEF3887D681CA5824F53718F59D28
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x0C81DCD200AD4F81B826F3FC1515C253
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0xC6AAF36C349ABB04E18AA1F5937505CB
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0x70B82DCAD6E8975714E4D186974EBAE5
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0x6ED58A59888E7B19EE36C4BC2D7B3C41
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0x072260FFE9ADDE328353FCE016E28D45
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xC7B34EDAD54D56620E2BC51DFDD3E370
day.

CHAPTER XXVI

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xCDC3377F6643DCBF5A03BF441453EFC4
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xF87E03E374041DB56856C44CA819DBAC
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0xC1A18A3A1B554C541F07DA7AAAE5ABB7
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x3A4D5B1666EBB74967AFB1E9DEE9A4CA
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0xF3F87E382D04C41EDC631DF0F3120165

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0xDE7364740808298168702A6222127749
not taken one peep."
0xB7B53189757679D03B8FD97230A197C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0xE27C18A0D15998A3C8A61398C387BEDA
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0x97ECB6A3CDC11AD62D51DB2A719188D2
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x0E12246A02BBC30425588187C2C740A7
by Mr. Rochester.
0x827F595B4FEAB57B490020A0978015B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x6DF7BBA0A674D71567DBA31556121208
so long!"
0xBF1115C03CAA8670B28CBA44A393DD5A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0xE98B9A6DFF1D63D7999DDE2FC25D6DF6
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x62C793F41B494B8554055FAA2441ABDA
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x776B2A4E2694B371E03D891F54EACEC9
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x4E66B65058046B4BF8236299EC131704
footman, answered it.
0xE2C5ACD83B820228C1E39B5B22160FF2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
0x5FBB5D22486408AB15318295A772BCFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
0x8B7652FB84ECBDF7BE557E055338D0C4
footman soon returned.

0x727BB317A967BB118E228FCCA6C307C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The horses are harnessing."

"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we

0xC6102389143C1DCEE86BE3EC408CA875

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, are you ready?"
0x37DD1583C506711C6BC8E20E8D90BDFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x52C0689D8639089171BF15D3D882E8B0
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0xEB634B308F4BF3B17510A2DD01309081
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x1155A6021FF9E9187EF558104BADD874
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x102DE18F46FC445F2998504802B3990C
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x3527F0E072ACFDA77E87EB5F5AAA4971
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xA1000A2D27B0EDE4CA5193A25CF7B0EA
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x6E7F3F1DE4231CACEB0B5F78B6EB27F8
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0x3034F563C65A833D1A3F1EE73E8A775A
and flashing eyes.
0xE1C45BB1C2B5DE0D11762F4A310987FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0xF83FBE8F6DDF333E558020C4490DB5FC
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0x5FD2B8A82FCFB4AE0839613CDB62F058
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0x8CCF2BD0563DC4340A35D3B84061081C
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x22365032FA70700A07DC67D5C5DB9914
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xF9C0BCA074E47C499D5C79954922200A
seemed breasting and resisting.
0xA045A6F7556C1182821DE8D6FF7DDDAF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x88EF2EF69C0BA889438CEEB2258A4516
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x2263CDFC9048744C04F3149A5FDD8C8E
me, Jane."
0x2791561CCC29B0811D1E2497D1E4A469

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0xCBDFCDEF0EA001CE27A11BC4209B926D
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0xAA610CCD72B2BCB07D9BE69518E5A082
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0x8B0E646A514A5BB695703803D240461F
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0x27DCC286EFA34E0589AEB70849A3706C
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x4DF1C6A683B56FEEAF32F3E161469974
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0x8CF59E215D7C8D9978BF3FE552A84AA4
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0x13CA68525730BE7A236ADB8FC3033438
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0xE3F401DCFAF6DF653E1FCDB620DB694C
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0xF42DB3328FB2B74B7ACF7D055B7F8EDE
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0x71E5AD6F3FD056F524220BCC6A13DB5A
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x881330779000D673EAA644B34E0D1092
path to the porch.
0x2EB8182DC664567C79223D4DF4CC28C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0xB68999E3A7219E8DF45156284AEB64D3
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0x6C99AF3A51FC7180C26274CD3FF179CC
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0xC14BBB425E785FD69D89829CBFE92F0F
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x342DC44908FECBA1E8EF860B5E162C8F
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0xC9E4F5DFDEABB6AE808D4A49BC31F308
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0xEF0535A977271647F3CA09D506D03ACF
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x2F9B0C01302BAB3A08F76DC173C9BFBC
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0xBA7F7687D6A81EB4662FB2E45CAFEB63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0xF9D37C97732763149391524F6FB2D4BF
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0xD6335A6D17E317532758699819F42D7B
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0xCB0472F5107C35D2655C5C3DF7C2F833
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0xBE379ADB7A7ECFB0B9C8B370DB61830F
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0x0D7E7BA964358565B1E7FEE05049D200
Rochester, went on.
0xB1DB0C58DDF30F81329FF3F95B21EFEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0x0603334BD1ECE5AAB49BAC6882AA0890
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x29A412CC8DE42DB1A3C313544F783968
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x66C3DC751479428C15000D711D7EADA3
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xC6994C9253035A9D1D44B6560563F36D
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0x19169AE349613CBA4350D16FA637F383
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x4BF4CFDD16393C5B2A2675EA33019545

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xA5317AFE9879A0C5994E3108E10ED85B
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x54881E900CB3E7060EF0369C19567A6F
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0xA095032CC0075A58FC8B732672B7B648
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x4A81768917DBC679AF741BE78F53C8AC
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0xE2C3F2192C6A71D6FA87E10B5F17D08F
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0xFC016945AEC420786154FF230AB7C6A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0xFBFF02AB58A119A2CDFD60F2B1DD2134

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0xBA50482F839FD9E054B6F455453E932C
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0x642131AF29BDD1C1612FC73F42CCD98A
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0xBF6AF0ACA627F3BE5A502B5A0F904AC1
said, "Proceed."
0xCE542BAFC92A67BF899F9CFBF2CF5826

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x66462A9A0B86E95DB48951FF795FAE10
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0xC7897C44446A373035269A5537FA11F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0x73E694FD3A0ED473362D206BB15235B0
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0x40668357428EF109C1687B36163A1671

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x3B0629CF16C0F99B2E8DB0FBD7B945E4
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0xC492A9962B3678F6F8593E02F3791C4D
marriage exists."
0x58F6263D004778E23A0A94545D38AB62

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x06E5CE5C35EC315C6C2DC9DFDF5E86C3
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x5BAB813C10D3E036FE8BFBE717ECCCEB
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0xC8B4A6FD913C29DD55D1C3D8A2392743
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x134E988FD445118FB13C5AA8E2543638
beneath!
0x7033A2C0B5D44003FA0A40ADD01F4149

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0x802C38F5DE5697DD51FC5FCB52735C25
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x139DF461E704FCD50D7D3CE5E23CC0E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0xDA9EC6F35287CC0E8B586B4864FCB0B8
advisedly."
0x5DD124BC2F626677D97E5B475AFFBE6A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0xD33B7D5773BD51EA12CA40C65FAC5230
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x53F4EFF513C9B258EEFE7D2A879FBEB0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xA56C749F074DA17A4DC8857A0A9938B8
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x313EAA328D51F5EA4828303CB193862B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xBFB1100ADA0242E3D16C4C8BF9BE81C8
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0x7ACE1174B76679D00A2125A45CA1ED19
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xC02565777D7E9B0CC04692AEDCF4F7CD
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x1E9195070606283F285B7E4DE8793472
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0xE6EE4D307F24D269AB63F9DE4B922695
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0x13823C792716AA6EC39A07D9C552A093
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0x514CF7C5B74461449B35389CF10B8511
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x0B359756CEC91A03E448876511DEBB03

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xE2F01DC6E347385B6BC499DB7493D906

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0xC59848B366B7CCC106E4067B6D57A841

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0x2E5B2604EB360A829EE910959ADA62F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x3173EDCDC7CD176396BC30D4A571F970
recognises, if you do not."
0x46B338860171D1BEAB85BC765A7B05A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
0x5221C4746D24DC501F5BC95AA8774B2F
place of abode."
0x009C2363F0777597ABEC6AD82DDD2B02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xEF5F276D679DA6DB5E3051E8AF5A67CB
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x66656DCAD83AFA4160925EDDFB1202E0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
0x1662E328B745E41EA54A3000DE9F79B6
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
0xBC454658E748438A3FA7FA9465311D2C
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
0xF4A9663DED3CF37800656ABAB6C9115E
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
0x47852EDBBCF855E644693FAF1BE5B513
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,

Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of

Mason.'"
0x1623038E750FB52F844E0F21FE3D5BF0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
0x19AC715E80F5BDCFE14D9D50EAC25EFA
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
0x474CF6E187FC111BFF6A479D6B3694D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
0x34B547CD790843F47CB91FAD8BD8ED29

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How do you know?"
0x52AC8B2DAF9D26B388BDF7FB13B1FC6A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
0x13F39BBE27B2E8599C75AB1FE85EBA47
scarcely controvert."
0x82783794882C62AAC721ABAE28C8143E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Produce him--or go to hell."
0x826A64E4F291CA87B9453A5DE515EBE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
0xDDE89E2D21701EB062F4EFB6453FAC61
goodness to step forward."
0x119C587254AEDC9402B4353883FAAB0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x1200721049A91EED4099B0A2E97B3400
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0x6161E93205D92F51A8D4D940A26E5672
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x31C1E84429B2BE274B6094E0336777A9
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0x951CB7D49722EAFC4AF24DBFE0C903C9
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x911D154D3D59D7794A024E662C3A95AA
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x586BE6254F68ED635560F05C851FFE6C
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x1E498C13FD2AA5B8E07EB03F8A8AE8D7
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x4BC6B1DAAA663247AC64B27591BB9628
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0xBA051E531AD435FB0EC152471B8AB4CF
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0xB7049FF21135D105C217457D09DA0BC7
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x98A4C35FCA47B9B8DA078FD2384D3199
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x09CA6F8F8BF0E1B9853185D357AFA873
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0xC3D2388E535126B0F9707C3A6DE8CD54
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0x07E940ABB5C86997690074EF25AEEA78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xE42ADF3BA4DDDD6E340D2CF8A7D031D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x77C3C5D10204C84BFDECD88F965FDBF4
what have you to say?"
0xE3B792187560B64282CEC07AB6726C7F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x776E6EEB43CA8DC528C52F43E339232B
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0xC7A6467FEDA6A998BB41823B2B18FAE9
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x3B6D51A6355B09485D6246AA9CB8BDF6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x843C42B2F6264DD2BE3EE659D48E3731

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0x1E88B500C63176EAF83BF842E061EDF2
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0x416E66C754ACB2A14BB1701ABB873E4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x5724B6EBB567AAD8C1070FC0A44C6245
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x5713D0BCC63D0D233CE83767CFFEF0D5
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0xCD9AD2FEDD1151FBBAA0BDADA47E1009

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x55EC92D68F39DE56BBFD2E0D93934DD9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0x62DFAF3D2541DB749ED760B2D12EE0A6
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0x561AA333BA9E5F9CA052AB564F930ECE
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x0309E06109A08B20C91EF3EA2901086D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0xC8079B10DC3719DD4CB417894B5ED673
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0x55DD0626C653277B932C3F2D2752CCD4
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0x86AB67456EE9904018D3E817818B6DA2
obeyed.
0x381180DF381180DFB456E1C52B7439F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x7E9564E64861E09611F4CB4136598204
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0xD0466E051878FA7D960926A64BE6AFE6
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x33EC625F756E07A8CCA8070E438F86D7
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x2E9C118B70DD3406A9306900BD2E3159
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0x98A8250E9837E5D9A32F45DA8FBA6BD4
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0xED296EEE261764DABF724928D6D9D609
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0xD1500152342323B8F2B9A20FEA7A68CE
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0x14A812C74A1D541503F97C803565EB20
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x2A3252AA18F9412F5D84C6A779B9D35B
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0x0219A5A69ED5D02D773B93853C1A9A8D
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x4CA41351638AE2CCA2968A54F98456F0
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0xAB695D5FE5BDF9DE0F94A734636B5890
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0xCACF114464206245CC7AC1D7B8BB37D4
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0xFAE381C27EF91C708ADA5F4132EA5739
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0xFB268347DF910EE68987DD7189AC3A33
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x4EEDA1B12730687E9D774257F65C8E3C
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0x64DCC1DAC97AF4E9D736715251E8378C
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x64099CC339C9B3D4991564230CB824B8
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0xD43F99DBA008E4A8F503AE30BACCE3A0
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0xE0C6BFD9E8AA8F3C6D59F3A0D586919C
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0xF81C276C547FC42A275027D3C56F954F
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x6509E0977DE793FA7FC8D687099BD38D
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x6EE173A4555B2566119E126AC9CDC87E
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0x137F8978A77ADAFCEB41322EE4164ECD
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0xFECF174F4528303049AF4B78F9AD153E
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xAEB61940FEBD5E6B23C6CA1406EC8A05
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0x9AE2E70F81D4FADD217F145B23BDF67C
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x3EFDCFBC442C9D2C1D20C2B14B82DC03
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x4F763AD7F21B6265929F52E4CA7B0EF7
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x8448141058AE3A1758BD074875AB544C
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0x887F4158EC6BF2E0F1D1251A87EEB0F8
you--follow!"
0x4C095ED9206F1166B9027B39298CC3AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x537A20C1341B709586DA2912C34189B2
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0xDC00ECACD57B16E628230A038AE05D00

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0xD3CBA97559486D47C3554F0E6DEEA4B8
will not be wanted to-day."
0xC9A309E7C875A94F8564E4526C5A0CB4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0x8F54D31C6F91585E778BD955357D14A4
greet us.
0xB4790D1D044A6AB462E25B1F49FBA4A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0xA209A1FB2377598F5EEB468BA6007ED4
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0xA6F64331203C9D70B2AD72A8491D4B27
late!"
0xF75F9914F75F99143D8953A051EFEE43

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0x6D3A125B74D8F1C75258053E57F0DF76
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0xE810974BDAFB97B363F1E463EE355B5A
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x47F6EC2B100FC36E69DD5FDB50E461C1
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0xF104296FB4E250A34E3A6B65B3CDEEDA
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0xC02E81CA5E9BB7F35AF8F9E40DD0492A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0xB65FCDA0D366F6ECA3D0DAB2C9E79CE9
here."
0x82DC87B782DC87B7BEFBCDAA0EBCEB7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0x6CA7BFD39E57AC2E361EFFDD5E967A1B
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xA4295A79F7DBAD1D8C1AF2E14CE53347
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0xA389B553EC893733E3DFFB1E5490FFD3
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x63271A5AFAA145AF1AF2A62245961EA0
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0x58EB8876FB51D0CF2F333BC17520F931
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x26B49A865999962F77C077EC02D7B2D8
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0x1BD163994DD2256490628FB708BEB225
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0x4979163516C8E0021AB8E078F9D933E9
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x282C79078E14B8800C45527D7002F2D2
mane, hid its head and face.
0xF5109004FE92E5A562D4E73E8CBD7DB5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0x62FBA1162C0B69F5FCBC429FA0C196C1
your charge to-day?"
0x85B24B1C6269270BF657C9A1450E48B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x071B8D868EFCB2D873B64BB214591A24
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0xAE2D6EC51CDCDF1BB4CE70D3665B9864

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0x3FDF3E3E1C7F17E3502180AE34105790
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0xF99B17F9420C56D61408E308372D54B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x98029F1001C7D0553DB02CD559B1A119

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x94DC62E6A3E9EC69A5FB5C46FFE9BA49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x990DEA18CEF9A1CB25CDB586069A4E13

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x53CD8FEC988F30110BA7BCB32A6DAD24
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x927DF52B83EDA279E6BF1D2F4FD5F7AB
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0xB85C9A12C674AE18A5D42D5EC405FAEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0x08BB79FA6BC164858AD62F6F19CB40E2
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x9829908B9381BE8CE27CBF9E7DE0C7FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x7D7B3AEA6AC31AFF2684F98D8E264432
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0xFB10E718BCB1A85DFA4B40C06E8A3269

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x463D4806904B3587368FA531BE2D492A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0xC58A0EFA2988F33F8147C4C2991E5023

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x2AAE1E003F1CC164A01D957BEFD08534
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0xBB4D57F9AB7C49901F11EAEB695BD060
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0xF0CDC2956F7439EF5704A8CE0B51D828
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0x3D753E231A73503B554FCC8EA7CED0C4
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0x9B9CB380AE438B91FB0293D55E5C336C
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0x3130A6F83987631AE7170BDC4AFF7B91
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0x7E502187A1470FCC64546A1CB47FB710
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0xE4796479F5B2800AA97CC7899621D5EE
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x5779CB9629053BE9F139496EA261B56B
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0xFAE85B57585965E48B93FF76F9640FE2
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x550BD2971CDABC2374D5E29D22407B43
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0x3D8A608EE81DCA316305B708932C769D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0xE9F6D8461D48DC30E55DE3245E448C93
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0x16D0D9CD8F65B1812C4617E1E8BEC1DC
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0xF54294064C68A794393E6FAD7A9245F6
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0x4CF3CFB5DD2323C2293D92283EC9AE15
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0x57BCC8FECF38ACC3D7287F80CFE78B8E
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xF8835E989018989F4628C49652BF4D35
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x452C2B7E62C5992E83D199BF64CA6C8D
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0xF2E59A621F92E8C767337106B9E21F45
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x7F97FAF3A8988F626CF6C1A365FD49D2
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0x6D88DAC1A1A27A8123DBEE6FCE63E880

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0xBB3EB44372746586DC1BB62670DB97B2
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x2C6FD873B5A5F2D55EFF47E412E2D6C5
the stair.
0x111F38DAD1ADD13C18BA91410A100507

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x2820D445E61AB8879A2AAD126EB9F923
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x2E2C89C155070195BDE3A7090DE88926
returns to Madeira."
0x7F553AE9FB31A53D36E402938CEF0695

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0xB40422F8A248F4E6F6A6A7D1F084A408

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xF427A19ED4D63B0138F415A46459BF42
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0xBD7E9DFE47AD5BD1E68D4A35AF3CF492
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x7B07554F89B6CA96FD111023549B8EAC
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x9D1C725AA296EEB6F110F3F94A2724E5
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0xAB18FA3F19C9B016C6AA64F1BDD876A9
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0xC97690C132719698391DE2E59FAE4C11
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0x6ACA4B56863EECCAAD7E46140E3EA11E
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0x9F5307AD684B78E2685DAB35485AB8E6
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0x94BC9699408B85339F5E8C0C934866A2
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0x0501D3EEDAEAF631014BA677F2637A97
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x107B71F12983BE4A968C4F6B1FFEC122
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0xC2CF699182C294D9D7480BA2E800B11F
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0xC18A560C0897D3CEA84A196872EDF91E
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0xCAE0444B48AA879BA97A896C1A3AFF7A
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0xF2C056E3AC6AFCC45FEA73F6D7A59BBE
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x9E99E78329746B106030A92CB2C69E50
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0xA7C185137BA962AE501EB7AAABFEBA06
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0x743926BDA3D806CB09D42E94ABF0173E
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0x5DBB8C2B3277F92FD5C8B5563876D205

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0x9E40EED89DF32D290F87D0ED6949CAE3
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x6D813F127AC4142A5B3E18B551251C6B
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0xE4DD10A3D255F1473B583489E47F9EC7
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0xE0896480008C974A41F229AE223E1399

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0xD6EEC6E2572982EAF15442BB93EB77FD
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0xAE1A7DBBBE28D80EEB6243AA3EDE6D81
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0xBE736A75399FCDB11EFF03AB40536EE2
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0xA01B823AD86CA6D5E3640DBA1CD0A930
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0xA2F4BCA4D0CB5BEE3A14B05D4E43FDF0
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0xCE476DBEBBCB673417035245F172861F
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x58BD8FFC04505561C808550FF8146513
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0xBBF64861D298B4907DB09FB37D04F62D
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xCAED227E7A4D36BAF3DB301410EAABC5
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xCC6CB2144859D3FD0D16B0008A648194

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0xB5866359ACFA5EBCD8744AFA80076673
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x4C983F4E17D6DFF4916848785483C489
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xD5D6FBA838A5360827EC6950A370C927
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x9EEBCEC98FD6A0FB19B8F269D1FBAD1D
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x1F01FEAAA4DD77CC0EF3E28643DD241B
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xCD027A333DF0C08E21BC599D04117B9D
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x8ECC0E4102A41D07A85E0546D1553C09
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x413C38AEF3EFC9FC262441534E50E704

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0x32DCFA094DC2EA0B5A1564ECB2CE7EA7
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0x4ECDBA641ED33CB19C370ABAF965EFFF
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xCC1C48E754A1E6597C42BF119E96678D
prospects?
0x527E988851CC667DC3F48C1246E2662E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x8E037ADEDAC687A6FEE650BE2D3E6E0A
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x684E2EAC9D6671E4ACA8B050A294E001
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0x88CC0E3585A57CE3C8AB8B19776B86AE
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0xF19E4C14302F4BDF001073E7C79EEFB4
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0xDD0FF37C1C65CAA7B64ADB37E6274A52
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0xB86C43FA28FFFC6C7930911D1101D4C0
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0x49C79302B9ED2C11E242918367FC5C9C
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xAFC8038587CA5DC7FC24052F34D785B2
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0x621258EFFD436CDB32B8B342E082B438
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0x94D624042FD5A5BFEBEFB7C26730C176
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x7CCD4B8CBC52AD78A32E1C0139FF624F
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x1A8CFE73FD1C69FFA78FC0ACF02B9F7E
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0x04F11AB4EE72CD3E9BE651C7E25F9A50
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x61BB7E7DDC622F447058E047318D5E82
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x34B2EFEF3BA97C6FF40CAAC8AAD66998
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0x4BBDCF377B80D3EBB08B5B12F472AC5A
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x53BB364EDAE8B366DCE96DDF971BADA4
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0xC345224D3FF85A196ECDC3CD9E739A21
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0xDCE952CC1589A35355CB3124796DC728
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0x5D78432963FB0856AD2E9F0AD6D8ECB1
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0xE2F7E6224EC2B2C7E0B37E16757BF77E
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x6CC89190948D605544A9637CCE094826
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x0C1D83084A2E6EB6DDF232D1A5EC3887
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xC3346D92D763D34D438BC6B67B7C705C
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0xA785D2A18B38B93059FA0227502A20D6
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0x48C79D7B63EB0AFCF529888334654816
conduct!
0x6957D3EA3ED5F2C6CF4D8A7DFBF45160

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x3D0B091BB6130C32BB69C3846EE415CA
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0xB0A58E0ECBF814CE6963494E09EEFFF0
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x8C7ACCE26865008F8A7CE27C39204C31
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0x8D2599288C96AE2530485B4A8C84A0FB
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x62AFC87EA2C22E7F3ED843967722B25D
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0x91B0FEBB04D133083301BAE29879A18E
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0xB92160654472EDA55E420F89E61722F7
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x722D9342974A953E5A3A6B99D2D5A777
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0xE2289FFA1D4E75A99F9677680FF5D640

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0xD9D8E31C742F3FE952C4575D05E0DC66

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x4518B4480D7DF31BA67DD65E789817B0
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x00AA9CF0D392C315CF26B177DCBDF1D5
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0xBB1A94008D53CB1EF67A53D28DD51878
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0x81B5DA983CA0EB58E28772946100EF51
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0xE12B7BD7DF3B1196F487A8DC3E2FAD97
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x83CDD5558B9803701556ECF5F8EA2665
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0xF3986951D914673CF978B1F63A943E2D
floods overflowed me."

CHAPTER XXVII
0x0C376E13C8549304634A3BD334AC1334

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x53EA9BD9C17E5D3E56CC9D12AD6FCCA5
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x828D776DCD1DD7C583EA2CADDABAB318
"What am I to do?"
0x81440011D5A9E6213A7F72B18EC78C52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xB971BBE4A78186EC3A836C31FE90E41E
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x5EA3BBBA68B8B1877E4BAF84B6A7D6B6
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0x6F2BAB721B0EE74079841639F3337BDA
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x6A561683E80FB0856F3FD8E5C4836AE0
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0x8F5DBBE8E535FF17F1692C8EB993402F
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0x86B25FD070304135DF08541C7D5C4504
cannot do it."
0x9B96BBCC1164E816FBC858EF47AA3637

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0x6E8B4FCFAB52E19EBB80BA21BED9C786
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x13FC2B778EFBF2E32B0052355BC4588F
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xF4BFF47FBD4757AD024DEE61FB95CAB7
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0x3F89FBA91ABC6434BA9503E37928D916
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0xC3985B3771A8B4E7567B1D3623FB1FE1
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x3B3B4C916D42915AF2A71FE4D7F7AFE2
depths of agony.
0xD2F8E41169217F3B4CECF534B2C393B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x83CACB17B7BEF2F747FADB737053F61F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0x85B61B6D04290859356A31CE7EE9FA21
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x3843126DB90F1A0FB7C89C09D3C0F122
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0x12ABDC02643650E8946448D33986176F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0x05A02EC2B52B79244A324034F28DC80D
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x2F5388E2D8DC17AC4D9BBD99C7CC27E0
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x0BE2C0610621C963FCBFBDFCADE7C7F5
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x72D35CBD9927E2BAEF3EBD4E0549206F
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0xCBD2688AAE876755287C177E03EF36B1
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0xD6F76B55A674011C1D19DB1D7F30B1D3
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0xB216E3EF16DDD54714BC4B278C49B366
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x9E758CFCCBAB47BD59F2303B98ED2C24
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0x75C9F8DBA7717E829C637618458FE71D
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x3A1DF9E99DAA059DCBBAB31F6183BB1A
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x8B0D132E133E893665B436C8BBA90EF7
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xC7487665AAEB11ECBA3A466BF2915EB9
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xBF81B1FA49BA19EAB4ACDF2FE4C7AAE0
threshold.
0xEF87A15E68AB125DF18B7EA9766D3C1D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x3E51C510E4BD7052ABE855056131A056
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0xFB3B60E82E3CF3A7EB433C715459398E
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0xA7CAC3180B2D7DAB0B2BFE45BC142B74
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0xBE26FC4BB8460D3610174D62AD125F90
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x24ECCE361653EDFD698F94D6A2007EFD
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x49FDF8AFD0E8509E25F3EAEC30F14475
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0xF1F600DC3F3D47E16BB7FC9CC81A18BC
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0xF6ECBABCDC5F16D98F0E8745102B173B
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0xC1D1ED391F60B2E1C7993D08F67A957E
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x790A41BD36633CF615FA933CEB80E68C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0xF1F5E03AA9C46B652256B5AD9047E595
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0x0881B2BFFC6F6179BA629136B0116015
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0x993118CCD3273F7635F402771F267945

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x73974893BF4637437F1ABA40AD514E3A
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x10C085694C15C982C2DB34F492832554
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x0CDAD55C98BC5A92816307B9D51CEA7C
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xDFCB6314BE4B99330B73E97E17B33801
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0xEEF19FB2D4A1FA921EEFE0316C06B5FB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x230A10FACB016E747240E676441C91F5
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0xCF1040FD11A1B4F10969762576B73C78
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x2B574201AF0BB6BBECBFF485DC6D7F18
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0xD1B033C86AAA190425FEA880CA833363
heart's core.
0x88FFA11A375715EBB8108648794141F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x9FA6F81DA34A5E97EF42CFE6D4D0E590
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x394D8F49732DDDEAE25D49358073E1E8
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0x4F4198D0DD911BE5A76383F6E7F11993

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir."
0x30161752A4647EBABE2F29464B995982

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0x1F822D2508F1E55AC3E4B5CD246DCB4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0x3509C6E3D0917200065AC1D2F23D5C8B
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x8C951E94EB19844FAA791447D0F4105E
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0xCB4F931AF0D4054272D9C042CF8084D9
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x63176C84F14E3E0329059FF8044ED9B2
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0xABFA578D0E3DD298D880B39575684280
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0xF643F29F4950AF915A6DA11F1BC2D559
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x153D038AA800970E44D3F58399572C33
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x1EC6E30B1D4F639E7856AEAE045F9625
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0xB817CDD4ACE6E692326957C918C6FC6D
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0x74CC213DBD449BA3CD781A725FA2AB7F
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0xA73549305231ABBDF7DDBB5E7F7545D2
him."
0xAD7921DCAD7921DC4383BFF57B100A4E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x36AF611C774FAC1985BF94D05F8E8017

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x5C30D778CD6337F91D8336527C4E28D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x1D3102DD3747F41225D82DD2C63B361B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0x09D014D03979675D00911E6B0F6790D4
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0x4D3B603EDFBBD1AB314D091417F946AC
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0x670692979FB0EF5D42CF76DCC828C461
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0xCB460D4F1403EED07B5D64C3F2499EC9
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0x41C2C1B4D8975BB381D25E344578E0D7
put his aside.
0x3434358C581C753EB4AA85ACAB7D543A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x03D87D60F7E47E7866A3C9544D3BD839
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0x1F8562BEA54FC5B11D3C050FDC2C89F5
appropriated?"
0xC978D03419984CEFC9ABF41E8D0C846A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0x3396D732FB8DC80F9D0420F996CFCC85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xEBF0F665138FACB6BAB4E385584BF996
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0xF21A2FEEC7A1EC794D1577398D44A077
rightly?"
0xAE96AF92EDA69F82365BC4AC9A82BFC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0x22D2DDAAD0FCC8DD6649D38F76388704
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0xA4AC19B98A45067C9B9E924D7FEE0763
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0x5D721A293AA75B2C5585CDC985ABDD6D
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x638883D8C7EC140018629896C2BE8A3F
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0xF87539C932D024DDD9BEA4193A017367
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0xCAFAE94D66489AB7D2DCEA89CA10B52C
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0x70B3D93B34D6CBB93DD2CC40B6B70B6F
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x42E40903FBC85F5108BC427ADFA0736A
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0x843A185225812742148CDDB3BB177770
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x12B8193012B939AFF178B2F160EA3EED
know you--I am on my guard."
0xE2943DF2E1173C90680DAF8003FCC46E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x10B16094091CCBABB8EB97EAEDE76968
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0x32660A604AF2F28FF7E5693AB8E48353

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x2823F2235E16E9F3AC8EBBBB3DEA52F4
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xA8F08F0A86260EB17B8A19BD16A5208E
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0xB2D179B2646A3D4C046581565F9E22E9
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0xD1021DEE750E586496F5C0B559F440EE
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0xD62E1C1DA430C0D89847FEF77A087554
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0x885ACB7E992850C34A37B2ADDFB93E06
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x3D60030962B292B0C8CC484A737CFCF8
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
0x59E64C94E30825E2F2963E2F801716F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0x3B96BA2FCBCBAA635CD581E6EA9CD28C
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x71F611921D2130B87F00AF2CED996C99
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x259303D2FB65125FA562B9B856E4F13E
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x0ECC9008A4ED2CFE9D27C97CF55FF3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x48458BD953D46384F52CCEB821F85CFA
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0xB920C89642EC248B2952A743D7A6501C
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0xA8F9B282C5AD6825FF7DE65C9C94D1CA
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x2E7139323C5712BBBED118B21F84A744
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0xBC382C3B5C5B7BC10419DD327F68085E
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0xA6722A89B63B013CA81A2BF226B71DA2
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0x5E2CC89565F1DA06D10EFAA0AF98E012
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0xDD9541B06937D9392E74D92EABB4870E
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xF95B50965ACA1752541CD9F2483C2642
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0xA6520797FA52F2BED1E1C4232FC68956
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x4CA1176B49C19A78C40E661902822E7E
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x40CFD82D0CEC6E0DA3B464FA6D5DCF1C
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0x28CFD5B0C4EF50CCC7AB2EF18D544390
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x96A20717B7379AC594013AE7F1307D90
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x9F161C5B9E7C1ADD9AB9338C97FE512E
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xAABAD5941F319797DE336E8661B42DF1
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x5AC5B0A7BF240A4E643B4A7AC7EE5234
assassination, even of what I most hate.
0x2DCDC860FD08D7B255333434E01E4960

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0x0EE90C8865C542087471B414E55D6503
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x2AC284D0A6CBBF6EDDE57FDDFFB37521
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x05693C99ED8B8AA00DA31C499BA34214
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0x62863B20A20D04B00F578FEAFFB8F7DC
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0x9B88D8E16BF3F714A08A1C84900F5D7A
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x04BBB39B42E63B4E8AFBBC987F372B18
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0x89FE9D4815AA6619F575E2F31ABE7791
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0xCC55020F6315DC14C8E09A2B36290638
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x881F6C1C5AE479C51CA6DEFF8D51F7D5
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
0x967691C2AD8F60766FF4FC26783C54B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xB8C28B5C660307178DE8A9F0F9C29CF4
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0x3EFE4A41C03A1722F8F3F50D69562749
cannot help being mad."
0xC6C1B647A259095E0DF7206E437434CE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x8916A5C50E5FCC78DF877E5767BF2B14
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0x98F4C691CBF87EF0F3EB2BE87C3BD64E
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0xE50BFFD812DED03B7C482C52B31554A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do indeed, sir."
0x5C52878E17DDBAE7DA3CC22E47FECD7C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0xF40A3B0DC39D812267223633781335F9
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0xE0B3BA63F6B3905114D15267AD192F91
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0xA542D3AA02A20E795A5013F2C3324AB9
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0xC87C95177991D5A357FD65A08B8F3885
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0x4A0722B6A587429DB1732F3A39B396FB
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0xBDF79CC09FC15D91FCA0094DF9885C9E
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xCD59624FEC6D78FF110BAFF5C9EF597A
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0x4AD5B74ABAA563EF16E0CCBDD4E653E8
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x03BDCA76AEC213CD3EE43E866BBB2363
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0xFF629C0E147B8F88FF04B9829B174BAF
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0xF7719DC6AC861571E703752347F28C6C
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x49EAB66157FCEE0DFC5A09208CE73275
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0xD2A1E2AE2E14311EF188DCDDA23E6F87
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x4783DDE1C714379C06F39B275DDC8FF8
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x279BA2E3FCBA87AD1009CFE414C30CEA
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x0B28E2380EAC4431B1E943B2315DECC6
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x8E78C0AA1FA139ACA1CF99BD15F54453
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x9912527EE9916A17F93A9AA8DA55CC02
falsehood and slander."
0x7B60FFFE5A14B5256F297DD1FE94BA57

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
0xE660E4F6429D3E0253FBFE5F82353AEE
for you."
0xB90EEE6BEB0E94A094E3514FB1A773B4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x46655F4A38538725526F1168803A6ED9
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0xCEF6994AF03690ECF3D304FF86FD5A43
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xCFF4EF1381B39D04CDAB8AF16F5B5D48
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0xABCEE553D032B23A2CB5C2ED1FCE8E51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x16BDCD02315BBC7AF97558B4CF18DDAA
too dull for you."
0xC7EC14697BCC50518E14E02F03860AF6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0xECF22CB0D91AF3C8E4F319EB5C7A0EA4
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x2E8479EFB2FFB6A9195CE221461AA459
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
0x1AC516FEB7E297219ABF427A8898609D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0x476F0F9B1DA62C71D318700AB3DBF3F4
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0x12B0213103A948CC5C042B8C9C94D032
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0xAC67C4B10A832A471F3D328BA0698B5A
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0xA84ADAD196C1E6F9F0300F690F736EB3
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xF62CCA50A9F1417E9629DD48FA0926FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0xC21985CCE6E81446A7598715C6FC12E1
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x89BECD21D255E087739DE2CC6968103F
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x1222FC4404079F8758E20A76E898D0A3
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xD1FFBE5642F0690A61C37CE8471FBFE0
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x0347B333D2E43B87625962FB51AD9272
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0xDE44D14FC6B4BFFA29188FB61D155549

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x3DD7722FE9E2AFA3A3D443BA0516A64E
before me.
0x290F0BBF21F7BC3BC8157AF40D87DAA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xBDE01DB12E381966A35B16E4D83E01D9
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x7E89A56C48266725324540716715F744
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0xD4F1966095785FB39E881A8A4838E91C
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0x5A90252AF51983086D749BA02C4D06F4
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0xEDE469F31DF7CD8ECB800967242CD7E8
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0xD70DDAA4454FC216C25BD46F3739B488
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xB57D5D7987668C3E1FAD98295CA9D666
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0xECB449BE1F47698A6E954B26E57A08DE
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0x98FD817BD7E500BE955B9338FF3832E8
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0xD6AAEF8BD0B8220A19A2CAAEB4838489
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0xEB87511117F6A57D3C5F8554DB8AFC74
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x983D00878D6FC6B84DFEAD058154D00A
soothingly--
0x7CC22C8A016640DEF7B62E62F5705331

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x3AE199F805CDEF4835659FEADCA671B0
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0xCB56CC2F64AF2121E80649C458D3F198

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0x4612AB785B6D05DDBFD6419FA7B12E9E
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x74A6040789D83AF86B6579E8F03BADBD
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x24C53A7DA9A9B58B835F0BD149AE6BED
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x5EF13F4F506894F4A77CAD70E5B5ED39
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0xFF4D0D7C552315A09B2B5D693A5EDD23
heartily.
0xD38133AF1B252B1DE76FE2A6DB56A563

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0xF46733E62C0AF58B9F531FF7A0F86F12
not while he was in such a passion.
0x477D27D238F004265BDE06EC348A4AAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x25E040812B7D1F092A43FBA140FD07E3
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x17D81428C68B390E68CB29A9AA577A13
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0xD202FA20BC4F626AF5C4F1C48F9FE28A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x414C8CC721D4DB624699589F08EBBDC7
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0x241EBE74751F7855C9B5EE5BF78D8A0B
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x7271F890957D78C5BD9FD352050523FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xA597F2A112FEBE67E9B9B9A00050168C
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x4207CD2032E60C921C9A88383246A088
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0xD6C13B938A7D472A414CA679A5F9A208
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0xDA8456CEC9EA90EA13EF5F55A00A05EC
were some toad or ape."
0xDC5C1ED231C846F47C713C9F2138FED3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x211FAC41A05677E6F93C618BE03FBE87
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x72B16B0BDF0163AFF0710997230679D9
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0x641DE6F12CAAC5AA04B6F2484EC218CE
where I had wounded.
0xEB07DA2C247EF088A0F4812DC3B2A601

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x1FCD10B3FC8CA510A0341C7F944AB843
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0x6B51685E7338465B7ACD5FF7665D933A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0xB84EAD4C7787C21B9DEB83D010E46754
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xD50DAD4EC28967D91626E59ED90F3DDD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0xF50D5493BBC7E8C979FF41EA1919A315
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0x98F17BA74002DFC61EFE2B3453AF996F
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
0x030C37BC37558F21D6B300B356FF659A
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0xC4D5A669A85DD42CDE7DA00B6AA5AC82
scenes."
0xE3FF7CC1515FEDBA95D157762E23B450

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x3704A6AC9D283E983F2AA6791C7C33A5
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0x08568A2256FABF02308CAB141A4F1BB9
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0x0FDD441156EE2E632F606587C3604F27
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0xC7B2231A24283AB5E34017BE73EFCA1A
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x64E640F5BBAE7EC3D0285D0F23468CC5
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0xFCB18E3C3E07A6C0BCB9D6EA0A0039BD
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0xFACADA0EC29E996B21BE7E5D559260FC
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0xB8DD2846BA21E1E85800A92524A5A987
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x69689FF15B6B6C93DAF7292D1ABB664A
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0x2F5DE6D636A587EEE46AD8A31416E8E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x99618814FBAF569247AAB3E2A4D749B9
still I dared to speak.
0xA872D09361405C7AC8E365B693E49006

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0xDCF998D2A499F3A4E7AAB3D03D727D65
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0x39FE6874F90ECA5E76164C4D5D5CDFA4
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x62729F98DDCFEB07BD5267A9C40FF20C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0x781DF7C314578AE8B12795C56860A2F3
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xE8EDA3309290C573D69F91A683F4E518
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x1F6429F24DE15C3E6BBD797815F6964F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0xDD5EFD781D55CF6300F44AE20FBF03B9
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x675F484FC9EDAE2645E3B5936CFA1248
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0x5C02FFDFD870A847FA85CAD5D49B38F0
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x379BB90226917DF7603DDEBC6C0D3F68
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x467A83DF32AC8205EA0FD3ED8FDACE67
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0xF3A81D6FF54C6A6CC443E3902EA392DE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x7FAE91ED169AFDD5AAEFDFAFDC765827
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x035EA174121F4F4C2C2E71925C429AEF
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0xBD71C176C3D36A9990177C54AB48726F
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x4F5F64CD2DB801B921A058E51FB5CDCC
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0x35C1A751829DA8D2BFFCB8FC6BE7E27F
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x1F1A01A2D827487EC47874563DA96B7A
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x6B18B06460E0D137CECFD4B1EDBB0FE8
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xF89872BF39E3B31DBC0B293C3E8217B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0xFEC6B6F88D8CC96E7059101C9BE8A97D
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0xA0A0242B4DD15EFA5E436D89404C02D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0xCA544D8342A328C621A61B4AC06095C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0x98FDCF66449B4D25B9049A2078225967

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have understood something to that effect."
0xF1BA863B29BDE74F71F1E39302082AD9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x7572E9B31276CB940638FD0D42D349A2
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0xED38D005DC3C56141F66A445E8C9B8B2
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0xED080446C23D4FD6BB1CE6EEE9FA55E8
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x21D551AD0987B96CD68FEB878B53F2AF
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0x93DA00186BD9D42D77DE8EE30679C759
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x68341F78A8FBC9687F23583A64771509
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0x0B13E79DC0408D1BB3109751B961EBE3
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x6FE73F786E006EE411D53A1EBACA16B8
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x9216683A5FB41ED5862A7437074EF35F
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xF3F72DDB512446394A66796F5F23C7BF
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x72E48EE09AC878E2D99298B16DEE7C28
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xD852B7DC5DA88E6DCD107285A5C054CD
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x6FC8B9201454F20542DF292B54243778
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x3C6D84DE45AB5942ABCE963FCDFAB30D
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0x627EF3AB4385C99812036BA16029E43F
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xD4903A206A41038C76BB7F498EAFFBD0
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x2C7EB1D8CF8E4D82B9B48C7C7FCB7D8D
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0xA242D966938057ACCF37D97396319582
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x4A54BCA68F7C417D08717B2B92991319
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x100EFDBEF9EF4A07C246C237409CDBD4
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0xFBD2D3EEFAD58D88068A61E42F69C3B0
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x4C4018773A315CE0D34A54C008F53921
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xCB11428758E8CDC202C5EC62E9143BE6
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0xDE45B737118DA74CB264E39E2E492CD2
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x9E83A11D8D6FD5741F479394DBD10F43
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0x90307E153E5EEF20AD7C3709168E3FE3
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0x504249F22FAF509F80D74D3143B1EBCC
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x3B0C3BE6F9ECA58463CBADD835A8B741
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0x7CBB504D1B97C51E7D5D82FAA8D75013
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0x04E29E617560D067020EBCF9B0566216
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0xC4B90DDEDB0A5E2CD8FDA5D856743DC0
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."

"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x9688514A9F116D649DCD0D9B10BD0A2F
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0x59D4FFB70D60ED04A2F6042139A11D4C
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0xA9B8D83F8174E35ADBC7B984FDD5D930
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x3444DC6BCBA586E3DAA5F70B47819111
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
0xA9C344637A87F27CC15CEB2094DF6503
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0x97F203152FF56DABA782CFD085E9F0AF
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0xB55609E85EA865FE3DA45D7C9FD3D8CE
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x43E3C10D665B072D58371EBE4614F978
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x8382F777940C44CDED84859D492CC3EA
plot against me."

"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x08D0104C7499C671FB3034F4E1A98C2A
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0xBE4EBC3A9F2ECE51BF90E043927FBF8B
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0x81287384E63D372972F0CBC3E6577B58
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
0x947DD5132E3DD967D05CB509E6959D7B
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
0xBC1D5B8A4770E7E43280737FB434F5D0
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day

with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x9A201E9DFC943843700CD88372721845
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
0x1072F7616A6330CB29BF234E38A5A900
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
0x4E8F49A777311D23D2332C598C1F2899
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x0D372FC3B1C5C8B01020BB0CA1F4F4BE
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0x0A2117B35D80009C084B9D42113F8233
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x375AE70EB739C53F5E410B658325CE73
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x04A51186528CE439262B8AFE55D7E2C9
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x3604CB65A997C277404201AD52CD0331
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.

"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0xAA06FDB72B6ADC1652072FFA8E44AFA6
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0xFCB4A83E918AF32F602F76A785848454
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x590376808698F861982BB8A09DAA0B70
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0xB44B06D9F1B4221B3FE5885683931F42
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x10B7E309C3999477212837F2B294A97F
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0xEF782BBE4794216002E464D77BA39FA9
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0x1726898288E5E6BF25D3318138E60293
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me

through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man

nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x758C77CED39B5F7391B7DF92FA035EFC
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not

that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x69F41F1AB131AE59C9E29F0CC5B49AC2
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost

all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xE3C94077BF5CA6D1322870DE5B74ABE7
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0xF43BE2419B9DE94AAA40E3FDF2DD6E03
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x8FB9DDAEE3BBB33F1020DC3E03BF6B11

0x01771C77EB5F73F5C759DAF267764462
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x68231C6B8D0A1E4456ECE556A19F0280
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0x47D9569392C10BFA4CAAF08687E7B3A1
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0xC17D8F6029B38F31CE5DA3CD7F6730EB
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x754F985DC5DF0EA542A98DB86EB36460
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0x8F917C5905E22A2909F96C5A101763E6
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xB59F08289930AEC834E91F5DCDB8EF67
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0xD22722E5D23741A9FBA6D04AD8474816
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,

she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0x786A18B6BE17C60FCCB7E314390934AC
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0x7347A02975E360BF727D1D91802B3759

character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0x906220D2A89909E87939600206C484D8

monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0x7918D08EA51CFACC8D490EB13D8EDC6D
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0x1A2BB7DBA5E3B71BDD6C4312C92C10E9
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0xEBEEFC8D1398D6A8DAE12F62402D4049

0xF3368B484196B87ED8087CC9F0935556
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x968B4545CDFC04788B48594B0DF3538F

precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0xBE4ECA512AA5D1A679529B3D13AB55B2
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x47D8825A2A81D21E00BF64C361BCBB81
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0x52F9768CC6A789FB9564CEDD1B15DBBC
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x1F2407F1B2346B0DCABF1640BF6A386B
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0x92074086922B71682BEAE3888E7B7EE6
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x80C925BF7ABD950CBBB0800A9F6E61A3
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0xA7331CE1DE8646716852DB8EA900D5A2
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x14EB4B813E76D720C0A5946F720B103A
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid

that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,

to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
0x11AFE713BE9D6EFA08193599BAD676DC
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x7061DCC7227782752873F5A86220B695
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0xFA2565C7300ABE8BDAE588CA8E76A122
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x8E13C122CC7F5F5EA91A26D1460460E0
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0x00872B61737316F4043AC2B52B920A0A
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0x844B15B666ED302FE73DD29316F5BB00
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0x973B105E51BEAABF322E8E175A4BF863
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x5AFF292841BF27D55E2983DE725AEB5B
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x0688C36CCD97F1803C555F8C284FF96A
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0xC62276AECF3235115EEB4EA5609BA794
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0xC61F5D05D5D4BC9CFF9E802CC739EB20
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0x07701644163C5F687CB9BC225F11B514
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0x249487EA61F775E192E42AD9181C7184
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0xC2095566AA0453ED24CB9DF8C89AB6C5
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0x35134F9E5FBF88B6A4DB52539113BD32
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x97DD0D652620B381C79A32166CAAFA3A
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0x09FC007CB9A0EF60B86C4398C98639F2
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0xFB85A40032CECBDB9795BE138B73A211
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x159B9DC1013ABAC12E4A15BEE6DF5118
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0x1F24062C2CB5446BAF2DC7A7C84E78CC
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0x7196DCF42B28A8B0F551674ADDD0A2AC
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x1CD91A76832BDEFE0A3D2A471613FAD0
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0x5BFADAA546AA270879F99A871A4E3A15
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0xE491D05E0B7A85A9E17A11B758AA7640
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0xB35281FA8C6325379F6A4417909C6B43
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0x1DBE66AA0EBB6E1EE3B46947CB080773
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x541D212E45D419D1B7EAC38F003D124A
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x1B5E8417151F6CB3DE952B8CD93982FC
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0x3FD628CB36F73F7550865FF71CCF9BBF
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"

"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x1DC5D3A100CF6D5E8DAEA79FBDECAB8D
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0x061FD170317EA19092F8089665C01219
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
0x0FB56A70FFDCEEB862B60E79042A0A37

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x982823B6986AF73DC15C5D321B0B1659
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x68A055E903A258EE23D4740E887F3131
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0xFFDE9B3D62ACEBF64A3CA371B476D924
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0xCE015EC3648AFCAECBD1D607AF781498
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xEE04155B1F6628FD4BE811135CDA4624
Giacinta, and Clara."
0xB6532AE76EC45EC72623BA7D9D7B6B59

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0x1062F6F3B8CD1BB4C382DA19A9B962AE
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0xD99739F1CCAACD35A55990AFAC775EA2
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x1794099505EEE192EF5F643E0B8BC0E7
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x4B1B469318159E6E28E15150BDA75404
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x7D7374A3B1A1F98E2ED5C7461F4E0E63
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0x79F34B8F52C970AB037BE45ED6746558
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0xF46B732BEB4A9DF736AF21EA57D7DB59
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.

"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
0xEFAD13BC5FECE6BDF18648F62658AC8E
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x5960EF66C7735C97CF779F0EB9733E29
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x96B77E041C196A4102E6CE6FE233B1FB
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x80AFDD33536123E4DDE479AC97AA2ADF
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xC67B39CB4E0E29065E69129C373B50B0
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0xFA0F4430A5E9BB55FCA4FE63FBB37D13
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0xE37461FE115D6E5B6508B3B38D99D888
back to England.

"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0x728F04CD5E10DCEE03A30C0E455564C5
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xAC3F8CDB39F8A0D7DC3FA4E6EA503ABB
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0x4D0683D9CE1A7BF43AEF3825D839172B
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0xEAB6537191C80AB8233E61B267302E43
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0xF87D3A5AB679EFC0C2930F5F349F4C7A
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0x570A36B97925A252EA3EE3487EC94C64
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0xB2ED82264B0ED86F6E57CC0564DA960B
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x4A2F0AB728D2F276CF7C3EFCD7FFE874
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x8A9A25632254DDEF6A042CA867D4F493
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0xC578EB5D01FD8FCBAA92E5A039F05E16
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0x876BE0A928B0D6A4F9543C0713F35C72
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x9CEBB44203B4BE6BAE1679F9EB23DF6A
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xE24CFC20A62C90FC91DFE4EDA7E7B1C6
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xF2A6FD8AECA53A57E0738453376042EA
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0x46674C8BD79FF50DA98DF01A07E8B922
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x70868C5D6B39CCA09BDFA61DEA5B9717
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x67EBBFF35C5727955CB1D3D87B559D7C
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x11258EE6E8983F57D05D9D94CA0DEB1D
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0xABEE254C45B0EAFC0F7CD7F990581EAC
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0x8AB3026F2E6E8DA729D48CE53773B422
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x7179F698D7C125E7AEFB2D1A93194A1E
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0x8FD89321A71295A75EB2FA5AC2B50208
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x06CB99A6CB0E0C9112426406AE9D14C1
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x31B435C87CB37F3B9DD880C623F1F5BB
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0xCFCC60BD2B8F3B40927E8F29B3C8A2E7
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0x391EB9C96683ED9C21ABE2FD56D86610
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0xF4F2398E057D6B9C84946AD02EAA53DE
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0x475C0766DD513A9586F9EC9FDB935B2F
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x960587127879721B4A12C3967220D76D
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0xB09B6B518C494538879E71EE951143E0
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x70D88D0A8FFABE2287744BB48A8E2B79
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x0A66141C764E7FC7B193694F4159969E
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0xFE46013D13B5E8DC44405E6D884B0049
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0x519117ADFBA81EF2D5F8E99FBE4DE2ED
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x5714A5F29CE36EB64F1DDC0F6E383361
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x777400D078C1C541B583A549294324E3
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0x87275D4E2739AC28B47530E1F63874C2
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x10836B9E94BF9099E688748602B93C14
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0xB7ADD4456A2228B038B9E510978744B6
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0xD44412788F73BA652CE3F17BCC2EC75A
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x528B0C0F955E89154C8951A030CAFE30
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xB56B7CF3837DABAD31E9A10EC6DAD01C
out of my sight.

"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0x35083A6981019E0B49B58D7DF8958863
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0xC864618884C84660E29167A3089A9BE5
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0xDBF4E72748CD112478D202AA6075EAD5
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x12C264D33BCD28138FBFFBD9D48F67FA
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0x1B17A30085E5B94872EE469BB1CD422D
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x9811CEEB652542EE0825B64A0F6F59E5
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x783A944115A4DEB93FFC02902AE844B7
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0xB176D5F3F497C9B59C9FCD21D548F15F
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0xC70066874DE985E34A6BB46E9973B791
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x04F7A93D955C785395019D07CF629D2F
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0x1C1C8549F7B2445A2229A8818E464412
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0xDDBFFC23E483050AF612845F6C13B51A
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0x665FC50C333CDF52952556F29F1F548E
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x1EF3240E57B6D51AC3D1143AC9AC4B96
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0x3936C23A8F31274EEB1E536BF1A2860C
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xDADD27EA0BA85263ACE15A250DAD563E
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x9C5E5A04CB3EC56D40AAB326406BC2AB
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0x581D2DC61F771916A73EE05EC525C3C6
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0x32841E7FDF4947D37462080E9BFC489F
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x2D6E6E7398BD7337B390A558A259DFFB
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0x39C487AFAC9E68EC10ADC019534C5BA8
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x430FBC2383B9D577ACF190AB6354515E
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0xC98BD72BDD2B5950782DE0E8AC0314D3
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0xC857C6A65D3BB12A7D870373C925B998
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x8B9D8E5947F7C1264C95B723E3CA3029
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0xAE0F5D3A22A747A67EDD0091CC4F22E0
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0x59AAB2E00214B91304A306D712E71ABB
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x2D42AD764CF73243DBEDFE5572F58DB8
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0x7C0DF2A85568A366A9783F9F90E642ED
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x4E3D43E2AAFB868F9F635ED54F0E09E0
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xAE7687F29E38209FE6C6ED763DAF99FA
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0xF9C27C02433D2B47190CA589A5F268A8
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0xDA9AEDD3381DFBD40813293D3A97FD49
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x9896FBC5F4028CF733BD07DEDA7950FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0x10E3801ADF2076DE3786EA935FD3DEFD
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0xAFAC2B2A7A3EAF13A9A12A51B64AE2AC
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x5490093F89216EEE87DA7F5716EC367B
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0xF60CAE51E26171E722E5ADD23259FF8A
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0xA1E8F3C467027E086077F4BCFC805D74
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0x5EEB53BF81D180D920013C29A3E441B0
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0xEAB626A67FA6A058A9A6D2037B3B0B96
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x1C4E6DD5A1D00B9DA9943DCB4AC9E2DA
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0xA0378C05CEC70B730C5B7C941F5EEE75
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x411A6724EBEEE2D63A9AD64755F47EF5
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x1E4199A61518560AE407ACEC4DDA83F7
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0x211F439B2E184154CB6EDA64ED9682E6
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x27C188D98754301585937A5216E81D15
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."

"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x64ECECFAC036637065BFCA2897DF5CD1
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0xB5505E90360E6803C56CAC907FB3D50F
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0x290316380C9948BC79435F67DE406055
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.

"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x0B74E4C885AFC71C86C110C6EFB42A55
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0x44CEC3B388E81D49F04ED3BB44F98814

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.

"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0xF6ECA51E0E9F989BC5523CA307FC974D
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x6B7B15E69CDB03B1F8461090AA93987C
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0xDB718E110F34D77250E9EB4574F1D748
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x25D16031AFDE86F47316651C271FE81C
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0x2BE95FD6C84B075D16BB49E5FFBB979F
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0xFB1E829545B398F4D83BF074F4D319A8
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0x65D48BED56C990D9C1C01110D01D09C2
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.

"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0x96324B510C7B6F07D79351F3723CFC23
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0x7C58417143A9DB95AED9F4D97CF0AFFC
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0x3ECC07411CF9BC4DC5030E82DB030DBB
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xA0B55108A43E81E0BAC35E4912042AC1
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0x09BD3F330363F34513E968FDE9D288B7
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0xB4921E02FBA54FEF79511C638B1117E1
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x9908EBCEAB23675D2EC93704D6E4DBE6
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x837AC778B2EA0B5CD2E30F04AFDD187C
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my

resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and

well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x957351D503C3B57EAFACAF6C914EFEFB
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0xA35530F6161CA63E9E98E726A5BD6ABD
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x2DA17C2D92CCB8055AC7E1E894E495B8
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and

idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"

yours, Mr. Rochester.'"

"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0x3F2A1D1D32AB8CE634B5766D23A7E46E
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x1181EC751D930076654A8A7EF6C28AA4
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0xC8CFE236878D1DDD2A0CF830DEB555C9
and to let me go another?"
0x8CE9EFD95DDEAC636832E12B36B7F070

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0xDF08240467FD14B0906FBD10B37507AA
to love me."
0xAE5A298DB5905C26A16E8BF11AF5C666

A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0xC362AD129125D18E270B6FCAE915E59C
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x7B1EDEAFF884A1FCBC2314F893281BEA
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0xEB7AAC23BDAD339B8A89AE80C6BDB307

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0x2519BB79284369080BA0C12A1EDE0650
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x200F320357D19DA686D7B6B35B727C9B
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0x991CA61138F288501598B27AC9F2A27C
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0xD26F3C55BAB3A1F424B0D3B183999BBE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

again there."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x9BFF2AC14A389584E9351A0E2F3E080A
rose.
0x1CD7ED641CD7ED646B85543436BAEDFE

0x277E76E3D5B064D4C9B2F6201B17C594
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x7A1E7E45E8A0408C07DF6016B03A7F91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x97F59D5896E645174A52DEBE238282A8
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x9FFB9637D5085411445D1EF784967382
will forget me before I forget you."
0xBCAD00D4F96F2B72F6259D4D9EC70BC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0xEB49AAA390296AA766284BFCD69D739B
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x6698B2603F809C7B7A7AFD8C69ADFF0D
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x8E2A7D0B4196F4B78A5A72B85006AD86
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x94CC21659D6889A642FC990A681D096C
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0xDF2A6033410984DD3E303AFE4F12510B
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0xCB3FB244E367682CD142A8344A8BEE92
by living with me?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0xC87F3E85F965D3AA39C2B2C550FE9052
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0xC5619AA9B29BB95065397EF60F90BA42
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0x663FB1EA2690CA4EE9C6DA31375B93C9
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x77407D4D6225286C46B47CA7F89F5A1C
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x80E72D4310C6B137DE5AD7E1DE4F39B7
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0xE6A95B43A8C70257A997B1FDD42C0743
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0xB930C687A08A44AB312B13AA3552E5A2
who will be injured by what you do?"
0xE526A4C47A855A9807CBCDFC14ED3F49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x456B2BB287262A6DECAFA1E17BDA58CD
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x5A4A45F508B4C02FC628A1E5679560B2
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0x78202116FF918C10EB7F482AAF000A63
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0xD384717CE9691C40A2AA022350165846
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0x61CD94F4A71E5CD19881CAAC9255E1CE
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0xBB7E3BC7E863C24564A44D86C6AA414C
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0xFFA3D3196EA17D031963287B4DA39DAE
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0x4A794B1D91DB41023EF9725272898D51
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0x78C1421B5E88D4BF848C44C1DCB9450C
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x4AE1FECF39942652AEA2317B6E4F8EA4
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x4F8CE08941C6E8344C4644599593F83E
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x435D79A17F032FA97A17DF44E06EC830
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0x3A53700B76B4E9F49CDE9D0846EB5DDA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0xCB30FB2D03F23742A77F7476AF5F82BD
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0xD209AA2B981EA2F1CD9887013692A67F
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0xF67E20FFEF78DE99241AE53A7A187AD4
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0x345D8F26403EA3EEC12B4BE285CF4707
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0x1180DDEFDF819C11D4B33041CDF2AC40
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0xF05FCCE2576F31808A42873DA65E30B8
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0x0496EF4472E9EBFD83E7D3ED685EA830
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0x06B051F749B2FD0E61C0E70E9BC7941F
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xD977FCAAA18F8AA8793E3598C41A9380
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0x42693F635C9EAA52D362CBE006FA787C
strength almost exhausted.
0x9BD31C385EB3413242BA7A03D16C7B85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0xA6FB586D63296982D0273DF5652CD2E4
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0xFB1FEB4F2365E9C33F0F37A11B743C8E
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0xECA634915BEDB5AFC5A52C23B87D02B1
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0xFCAEA4477EF10E6F65E1EE0D5DA9A8FF
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0x7274E87F6689B645D0814C8210B9C1E3
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0x11BC9B373FDA8A3169E948386F5F05A3
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x2FDD67317A4E571E6A77A89400151503
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0xE71C2EFC683BB4E5524F1884782519AB
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x778B6F0589ED611FD3EA316645A74F95
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0x737D840E45049E52AA681A0F7D3710FF
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0x531A2DA1D347C26CFB083D06F3A3EF09
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0xFF9CF30B886DE014612B4A7E02EBB754
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0x117C0E14EA4D50B734525CE4B5C5544C
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0x47EEB739CD8FC31474345E78BE0DAE09
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0x8BF3C4F6415228287DD7571834D3759B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0xE400C1ACF016726ADA19031F485E7F01
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0x6EA2C0C9A619A6A4D58776830F91AEC4
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xEFA1E01BC1778BE69ADD67102107F98F
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0xE1E0E9F52BD9AC0F31A77CBEB2CF1343

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are going, Jane?"
0x8186DE46BA3410AA9597F35286070C1F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am going, sir."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are leaving me?"
0xC73EEA39C619DC695FCC911328E04CF2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x1894D32E3A92BE6D383B220BDCA9129B
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x7F597AE2D027A4D3B22DC9E800029CD8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x685430AE6F818F3AD2B9B403F196E7F0
firmly, "I am going."
0xD537817083295A8FB511A53D1904675B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane!"
0x89A61CDB89A61CDBDD35A24D7183995F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester!"
0x1C715A51FF649AF619CF14D74ED39133

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0x07AC77DC6336017274BDB5A9A1A6E30E
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0x948F99E64105C077C8B64A965C642A1E
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x82671D3DCC39E035F5CDE2A477B4A821

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x7B8AAE0F47ED710957074E9BC7EE6D86
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0xFC1CE4117734BFFF712E8388D32EBFF7
deep, strong sob.
0x822ED53E23A62159CC39E69B1960AF5F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0x86598B64DED1CF909160194C83FAB0FB
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x318D467587AFD772E9E428C559D237AC
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0x09FDAAF95DBC89A385A4D37A9ED6659C
hand.
0xE550D4E8E550D4E83025213740DCF2A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0x06AEFAD67BF8A8D9024A430AAC92BB91
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0x1B8C2A8F79EDFCD7EA4EE10EC1113AF9
me."
0x280D41FB280D41FBE5BCB48147E6D283

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x4A9756B52919D8AA39FF79D50229ECFB
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0xF35C1D46743403C3A8410F39789FCBD0
yes--nobly, generously."
0xA3C265D476CB539AB559B046F9F87BDE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0x8428EF2C69A016E9DAFCFA5A95D733BA
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x292788142C01AEDB7E2694F5C33BF1AB
once quitted the room.
0x06B5300EB567CE6BB5776338FD46DAB9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0x4EBABD69D209F6905B26E2C8AEE7921D
"Farewell for ever!"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0xE2CE9560342F843F17A7A2B1F6D0ADED
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x7DE6EC1E2653B90F0C0C4E8B9869673E
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0xD3B9AC8CC488085503D490ADC56C60F1
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0x87D8A9BC4D270422BD941D4FE4E012CD
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0x1D936B0D70661F7AADC9C7531EDD4366
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x700AEEE04460C2B7C3374B90DA0638F8
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x7F373620FAF1A96AE55EC35B79189825
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x190CCDDCEFA44CE0CCBD4B263EBC7C8D
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0x0DE976014E3DC30D4E1BC42D2190EB0D
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0xF976BB0F1DF576DF7420B9F3B1C26535
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x3AB0E8BFB99E0FD78E68F6F89120457F
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0xA03870579D0EB161CA05CB3B35D24253
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0x49F86746715A9A4AA09B32A7D97777E8
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x8010AF17F9EF8D0D2CA49CE0D01FF3C5
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0xCE5010A73D0799CC4095CD08AD1D2266

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0xB74B0C34688BFE0D07C0A059B8E21B03

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mother, I will."
0x09408EB02C9F3AFE453EAF4FDF3BE6BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0xF18215B6C2C5E6BB4172ED6EAB6D66B3
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x9EA64FC999B7D1EC4E8E8FB306666387
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0xE370ADC8CC3155BD793E0831C8AB84D0
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x90463291F60A91600EE322DA1361A879
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0x47C4F16910FEA8E8A2BA5EEFF41EF542
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x331496BD926CD7C62F1394592F988340
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0x49D1CB302EBA1EAED54EC634A0F5FC31
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0x0E58729DE2D822D8EB59407030D25130
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0xAE13264A012F9C7D53DD63DE08E44EFF
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0x68D92CD30ABAA6BA436DE00053208385
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x7973D78AC08A3CCB116991138130E41D
from my room.
0xE3EAFDA087871DA73A61DC09F9387546

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x9E22B80B55B5F129015186F943CA356B
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0xAF379CB2068E7EDE1C1D973284708812
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0xFCED7770DDB269A22C7F712DB199C584
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0x5E6668C75310541AC2676927BD626EB4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0xC4093E6FFCFC91DD4457D65C694CFC7A
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0xB3B332E73972E5327BB009A3011ACFDB
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x107A9861D7482B465CFF66C0B768D177
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0xA99ABBBF661CC2CDD224C39B154BBD07
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0x8F049CC7BD31BE7B603A40656087CB8B
to go in and to say--
0x57FE5CC5AAB27FA654F8720B9E3E0E2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x668EFC96174FD8F3CA0272105AA3C08E
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0xC4EAF939347B69BD4251288A2DF14A23
this.
0x700729E2700729E251CEEAEDDF24DDAE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0x750D88B9567C7B2471D661434A25D1A4
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0x8714C97FF4F81296EE51179DF182B1B6
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0xDA75133D2FC2CEB8EE8F4E91B924A9CF
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xBAAF4A96FFFE1E1AC6E7A9847CF4942B
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x5B58D44753E91F88073652EA11525AF6
on.
0x9A70F6CE9A70F6CE9A70F6CECE2EFE98

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xC0084CF1982DA6875CAD1CEC1CCE6ECD
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xE7D18F2E046D22017918B18079BFADA3
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0x3CE51E758FF9214E648248F0431B7A6D
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0x23C2FD9C9DA9521949B11A9E1666D160
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x6BDADE18D60CF957686F59650737236D
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x2E244AB73F12CE99F0B604A6CEBE451F
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0x7FFC9A61B1FD1AA2DEDC1C0BE1571E4E
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0xFE52249041DA5A5653FD545259EA9785
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x8053B70D47CC70F49200014F06EA90CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0xBAB46D952FCD7A4356E338E7803BA0A1
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0x16AD4DFEFB17165B47DB8834C26967D6
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x302313ABFDE6004683B6429F8C0FD09E
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x956CE9F29E2254E58200BB815EE9FF25
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x63D277A9721A906F20AA6A51F2BAE686
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0xB7895B23E92478332FE4F0B92683FEE6
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x9C2B46B85F0987505998CC5D71B0E82A
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0x351563C53EE2879AB1459D17D4309554

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xF7C7A5AEE3F2E20DE77D6A081A372587
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0xDB7DD52B82D42E1D9033C8143C0F5A44
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0x3A0AC03BC03DDD8CC545D84FA40E3F16
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0x0389387C75C06EACBEE96DC202D0F529
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0xB5029B09A8E25CC6A2E189017E6810B5
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0xAFDF4C61D208A2218645DE9E79F06E9C
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x709BC4164CA7C75E70ED56B54CF7DB9C
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x83546AB020DE0FDB3B254667BFC71722
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x80CA206CF23428B320AC2AF642D38650
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0x402BD70F21AB7E2B18168FEC8AD498E3
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0xB0A43A7033A2AE7C3479476F27AD4AC3
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0x159E2DD9B13106EA6A0ECA1E95AD5963
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0x467C9E3E77A396D374493F45D4B4F7B2
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x02FB1A00ED70162ED7288C75BCCEC11B
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0xED18F2E1E6693DAF8708D7EE9C689431
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x96A194535023AA2A860FF24147EEBA42
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0x53DAA8103FA7AE0601C002BF63B84945
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0x95AFBDCDBA4A448B47BF780120FD9C3D
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xF1309D6E0BF183F9922C947EABB5599C
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xF2E3C7DC30F73A03FF28BB7250B2EA70
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x64212293114415B772172D88DE542A3B
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x2287940FA64EEAB446DA186AD2AB66E9
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xFDA614E3DC63EB5C55B0A64BF7FC9B1A
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0xF23609CD0D548B0D293AB854C5D67BD6
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0xA4FA5DAB3BE549F57132926D96EE9D6F
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x987BA500DAF5591FD1C1A7C5731C6C92
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0x92CDC682AB6583444479AF6ECAB9B267
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x2F2DEF2CC530B7B5B8E310E8CEBB2A7F
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0xBACBDECCA51969F67711F60EEA3A13DB
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0x2ADF3DFD84793780AD3CD8790F92288E
ever to reach the road.
0x4DB9366A390F8954EDBE3C27FC471ADF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0x9E500E4ACE338861A3BCE6A1531C9B15
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0x792311DD2211AC7F3461C3F7C208A35F
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0x4C0A167DB25ADA5CE84BB3F82122A8C7
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0xBE409D9EF15CE38162C44220772D4E08
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x929AEBC838E2EC9AD15332573F9650DD
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0xFCA5131BB5D5F64CD11F1DC07F97194C
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0xCB35A6867A06C7FC2164E17542D9CA91
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
0x0154F2CB49751AC3D4DDC074C3320E48

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x342885060EDF9641B9A50FCFB6FDCE0B
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0x763975CAA233B1BC5EA87408F654D24F
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0xBA62875356CCA52608CEB2C796AE1F70
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0x0FB558DBE05BFF1BAC079CA0CCF39CFF
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
0xB2DD4AF77A0CFCA23D589B71C5101911

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0xBC0A5C65AE739380B2145CF25861BE60
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xC7587995503DDCFD087B667E5D5A2A74
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0xF94DEAD5F12CBD94CFF365A3D76FE19C
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0x45162F50886039FD465F7E91C708C5D1
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0x8BA3CD91BA8DE3D078D143620399F3A7
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xDD2F496F9D05E29D53BC0D94DF12B676
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0xCF8BED27B0177C2E497AB44FDC589F2F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0x6B9509066AC84C147209C327CFE05134
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0x69FDDEF4AC8A3B59C55317CD87BD2EAE
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0xC82065CDDE6618BC86ECA33937D2F13D
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0x707A98C20F3C1B385F92F0BCE9752CAE
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x9811197BD5146DF39A30993B092A5D6A
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0x58EBE6855930DD04B31E39CDB966311C
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0x0D908C6DA6B6E49F1AF8F88A8E2D3CE3
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0x2C977C687B0167643D49C0FD0B11A60B
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x213C06BA79D11EF7667EEEE67B80ACB8
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0x338B180BF48B4BA20B3544FD5EDB3555
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x46E18AC2CBBB9981E711618DE47C19EE
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x82D2AFFC03A3BDA581B16A2502364980
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0xA91D10B24A166315EFB2605AEFDCCAB6
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x822CE04677B910AE0325C3FD1E092EAD
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x78B1CB56CC6894B3681C98E14765AC50
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0x6B89A4E073DB3C22ECB360F7B4066834
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0xA20C8081E5664BCA4326DA6326624EC7
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0x46383581A0B17C6178BEA24457EFCD06
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0xF7204E4FE3BAEC89C4B6DDEF8983574E
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0x5261CF53C96652D51376DF8E7B829968

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x063903D8E3CD145540BD42106713EDA1
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0x6D047B78482968EAB5951A1F115A16A7
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0xA1BA29563B8F19C585DB0869E81CA7C4
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0xEE8DA9D7116765F6CB9674FDFEE83DF8
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x7E7179C41D9436DD85DB339E627D0768

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0xD4C33A50CD826DC417686EBB18C7DB67
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x370EE4C41E41F21A741DA526A8F99C8C
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0xAD0799E113843FD099D6F6190298A661
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0x746938ECB1BC1BAB6886CA8D2B294E6F
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0xA95F96D4B70399A74DE590DC7142B0CC
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x2AA24E2315DA85F62683F282A10E6384
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0xFDA75583A5CB2E458208B01D7AC50114
regained the faculty of reflection.
0xF71FB2500487CBDE9770517762717CB7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0x56F33C1E79FBEBB2F30D07BA1F42E552
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0x2CD161AE2FB58E63811376B9FC99AC2B
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0x2AEFEF95AD7C364E902956DC2A544679
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x0CC23888ED0C3CBFADDE4AB5B61A669C
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0x20C7B671E4DBD95343C2B94DF41C85B9
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0x3B265E010A3C702E4CF69F88CE3F4D9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xF8B20B8A4FD8DB75313049A1CFB39315
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x44C8D400AB1AB173FAE66B7BC919FBBF
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x7C1F3A508C3E6D2CFD0B08BD8931CDB5
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0xD05FAF9E963890DF57E7D578F7E6F529
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x1D3B6466E141ABE2FC331530764B51A2
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x85D4A88F79DF616728C228EA61EF69C4
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x207825FA62F0603515006473B202B58F
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0x61C58A6117A82402EBC13064675E6B7F
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0x5BD930AD31E18F88BF02498F28FD7DF9
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0xC182ED352966B6CE6EBDD5953BB74D94
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xABD441DDE6A1C24DD2C818DDBAB62B56
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x999B06F56576837BA972399BFC6A14C1
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x240C2EFE6AD2AF2073FB83DD86DCE870
then chose my couch.
0x673613EF4CA29942FC4A7818C5543C29

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x4DCCEB6233FE566708BC009A01F13D1C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x04A91D5A6C4CBE8AB90D3407036005D9
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0xEAE6F9308C56003C443D07E2A6BB592A
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x5FF5C4E1FE39BB4E7200B20AADDFDC80
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xB004201F0FEE2CC5F2ECF2EFD363B07C
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x673461682668811ED6DF03BFB75A1C45

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x08032DF9ECB31D0B8504E208FC6DA283
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0x36C4C868476817253842F632A6A8B632
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x272F2D1A6E952815D69C40D7C3EA99BC
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x607A3A0B621C3C692DD9A42DAAABE1F8
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0x2A4CD5009095A1D43F6003330B012397
attempts to seek him.
0x3282928336424937E4FDF0763455D272

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xC9717BA6D3E690E22588F31E8E066279
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0x477F00B8339A1A220AC15663DD14CCA9
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0x463208E858FF3E35BE3D434DB0FED578
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x14DB4013B2386CD5BCA39EB8DCBF3398
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xF3B4AC351727F1063FAD69E308B97DF3
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x1FB93126C155A549C306AFC71F8C6856
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x3D46E38E8097D2B1FBBFB20B7A36D84B
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0xE8C9B5A32A5BF4052B42858100CE6808
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0xFCA9703A436E68EF93CFAAD4B84043FD
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x0CC04265C29016C66580331241A87BEB
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xBF3815756B3F1513CFD723CBF0E1F286
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x3BE8BBDA488C7E1CE279041F427DED47
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x500025A1B0120446584415EB6E3D3CAC
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x53964CFC45889B0A5A7FE98803E0C430
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0x79DE2E7575077BBB8135BD854A1ACC2B
sleep forgot sorrow.
0xD4E74DA07C97CB6CD2DCD993EFF611F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0xA5DDD4D6F3525C108FA43E5EFB237CA7
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0xF2DA7CA19331E60B8EA3731B64BD2DC0
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0x3F27F1C25D1DC977777E5A6462A53B91
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0xB3115414B0381A9F2C6022DEB5B8441B
looked round me.
0x37822552D21974BC1793EE4EC36DC272

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0xD7C6128E0A35C66DB4A37D8EB1ED7C2D
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0x0BBFA13F321A3173A846D5B9EA2AD94F
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0x444B8B4E78C577F191F4558786E8C738
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xE59027F938F024F4D81C879DBEC67C8B
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x474F7E4CD229392605312992D129BA95
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x3B75A4564DB519F396401A6B3F0E596F
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0xB963A21F58B48C29F5F7F95706D1BDD2
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x65833AC3B4FCE191ECD5693133634FFA
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0x423B908B78153DE6D007FE1FF1B459DD
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0xEBFD9684F15C7FD5F4F7AAE21FDDE929
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x978557E88BA5D7A435DCAF8865AF450C
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x168D2069BE2C2B607818B2298CED77FE
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0x5DADBAB1C3F7F0D9FF0A5701B3E86AA0
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0x7EC6834214CAF081D459AD8B9185F55A
out.
0x8B062B088B062B083CEB0FF6977722CC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0xBCE927FA31866EBDBE6BBD6452977AE0
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0xD12B4CE00EAB4456EB6C8C8BF5664521
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x416AD7D41EE8118E7965D46B7E2AE444
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xA132DACE2E44428BD6DFC2FF420DCDFD
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0xA8F22F3A695352ADD8CF0046EA4ADA39
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0xD53980A2106EC16216D02422F20A87AA
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0x635724899AAD25B4CD06BFB6877430A1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0xCC7A1325EE16CD800C0EB38131F318CA
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x2B65CC33F75CD27B0358797D9DDEB231
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xB2590E5940F87220FA3958106BDFC00F
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0x5C967982C38BC8ACA17F99A0FCB0E620
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x4C26592ADF38693465D6A92977F6E146
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0xE22D77C5FC210F6C0EC70C64D1C1339B
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x7FA0E9B8A60EE623F700EC46EAD5362B
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0xBAD02FD9B5A997184A12EEB2CC96340F
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x098D0281DE2CA6D35550BBA766691509
like the rest.
0x97AEC97DEDBB09F54AED8A13FE7D4442

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x6EAB3582F85AFE2E91F8A5E3045ACF05
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x41DBA4B699D0A1F9C66D6B46AB467E45
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0xC13E4CB33CE9D149FE8E9296A13FC801
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x1D05DDFDF98C337CE9224F2DAF6FC93F
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x922B50906ED017FEC5C238A41092A61D
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x69F6604D2F44F5E76D9CB21992265784
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x83B4F79AAAA30FFEF670BFC8B7F8F361
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0xFEC3EB017195EDB914461FEAEC7363C3
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0xA5A91C03BCD2AE894A82686C47EE804F
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0xAE9F8FAF92B2CEADA59E4225684264F6
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x773B33988E9D385D3BB711D127AFE03A
would not; but I must try.
0x800DE1E3113DED9D945DDAA6B3B375AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x5B3FF6B786F835C810E67DC344E4C438
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0xFA323F6E75F131CF426029EF06884237
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x62EAB52B5A62EB538DAB169728942663
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x90BC6E1069E083754359706A4A35033F
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0x75D4971EBA070FA176F1CF0BE1019473
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0x6A6D3067DE746499D74DAE027E0EB3A5
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0xBF49B7F5B16E0787A70D885F59597CB2
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x1CAA286673784E12B418514C1E2FCB1B
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x0FCE0E796EF08B70417FD94D21C3037D
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x018723416A468F9FE0FD70FA5EF505CB
the village?"
0x8E5D4995A77F13332C0F3BBD1F22714F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0xA917BB0A198FDA9091D21EA7DF2D8A56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0xE7A808DE6B34E3A5058ED49CBEFE7157
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x083C5676CEFD67EBD0623526DC4FB8E6
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0x643883EEE724285BC77AA8EB6685D8CF
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x0A041106D89BB93D7E33C8D531CD6FF6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0x37058870A70BCF2CF9FB24D97C26C247
wanted?"
0xB002472F7DAC8C09003426A66461DF03

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0x4A4FA87512AF08F7F69806DC780E0965

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x019AE4ED0D9ABBB17FF299681504A823
do?"
0x9EC123C09EC123C0844FA69D26D6E730

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's

0x7DBA6ED05DCC569E406E405EE9A8D2D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
0x08B4A10F772736BCFA6D6611B6ED9561

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nay; it was men's work."
0xB60048BCF416468582F57857B1153488

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0x9E53635B9E16009EF481D285FE620BE4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0xC99868C4AC870E06CF4CBCB28685D7A6
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x1C11D32FD3F8A84386D8E5109FB795D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0x52B8B6479312717032F0F96D4CF6F24A
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0x5696CEE33A7CCDE4701369A8BCE8954E
wanted.  I took leave.
0xC1BEDB15672460DC4A2BE9DEE8301F69

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0x56E7E108F212687FBBC14173206B09A9
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0x253A25CC914B0E1F4CCF35134395DB7A
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0xBF2692E8705854DEF9250327A0A59EF9
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x7DC070EB16014F6F28387A3C7504370C
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0x816A3B2F8159B9BC335BB746CDE10B60
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0x923C2EFF52342E268D21D2DBB7F9B7D3
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0x26630B33333EBC8724321EA187ADD2CD
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0xD4384334D89880ED7C70784422F2160D
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0xB7D91653D83AFB0E06A94F252075EE82
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0xC44AAAEB97A03FDDE6F604A2C6E6CEAD
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0x5D336AF6BE4DA314B22C3403BFD9AB2E
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xB402D28A1E19A6EEE38620773FFA8AE4
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xE7B9FA9A64F8953BA2FEF87D7FFE7827
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0xADA002BAC16FAC5D742CB71C3F2F880C
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0x5A0F340E480B148EFDA78EFC281AAC96
if a servant was wanted here?
0xF5EA44D033616FD70E0CDA03EE340942

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0x33DB86D0C8A4DC820A4612B9940D9E85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0x0EF29726A52B21646E95DF6B1E4AEE07
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xEC82983E3954CC01C58DD450E0090FFB
no matter what."
0xE94113B7FAA12A0CBA233B5D6C863961

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0x61B2575F73A7F75FD331C80DE5C1EAD1
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x54B98C217ECA711E823D44AEE1194910
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0x6AA6DA615902C854B2E4A1D052F0E7CB
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xA0F2D22FEADB8282907C370EFD75228D
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0xD8053614B39C5EB2EECD457458615B0F
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0x3C6545ACE267CB841B81567022020D20

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0xB06159051EA913A9FF3590F9B4D4B1B3
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x97E16F8710692333031EC495F5B6FA65
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0xBFD88BC04138F4C774CAA9D925BA732E
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0x1703E1845D370BB81F18EE2D9FE47F76
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x197DD72D86766F5734B12E39D2C1A267
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0x8FE21DD5FC41F418EAF8D1B16A18A79F
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x492E5ECB7D62425FD92845FC13684796

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0x29204B125F4913DD3EC8BB3B364AEDB7
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x6723AA50037D5430C6BE162D5234D8C7
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0xAC855A2312524900983AC8C2551D7F4D
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0xDB83940758CE4C29FCE07D1BEECDEEF7
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0xE07A34DB6E2B6EA07BA51A7443A02681
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x51CA97776FBCB4ECD4DCE90071B31861
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x8D4D1C68C9CAA4BAD6EBD75544F6AD5A
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xFC9DFD5E52D3568EF75709434C21918B
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0x7763C719E7DD444822D2AD2BF832BBCC
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xA66C797DAD567E6D3B74CF44009123BD
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0xA292D3401F811400149861241413C5BC
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xEA6E76D23E92B053937A94DFC24E9C00
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0x25F098307E6D0A87D95AC3FE67560A55
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0x60D5DB5D694EE6A6971841EED3A231F2
this the parsonage?
0xA6F096D987F5CE58DD8ABCE638537347

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was the clergyman in?"
0xD5F798BAB21171170B9F6714BF044C14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would he be in soon?"
0x282931FDB45A5DDE7ADE79EBBE18B7AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, he was gone from home."
0x13E9F2B788FB3750FE5AD11C1C2DFFF8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To a distance?"
0x29C6ECF6751641BE927275F5828296C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0xEDA30C66BD704D810024FD6A2572930E
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0x0B909A310022E81CF6DE8CB2D93A499A
there a fortnight longer."
0x8753FE2E8D9F9FA181A9836E3B8E1CA1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x95A9500F2C7A687083C3D608CBC11C59

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0x17161C938E946FE64AE34E143C3DC5F9
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0x6A193F89C0CFA1106562DA6905C34ACE
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0x8A1C9536825D93DE3AF9F9C996683584

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0xA6AF44AB6A193D8EC6A788597C92C654
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xAD98B35CAE915DBB22CD13A9590E4ACB
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x3B1259F21221E781887364B25AE332BB
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x9E3F76243D75593C981B0D3FF6140E81
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0xA39E93D6DCAAB6C6750D8C530BFBA213
for this handkerchief?"
0x625D202C5BA3ACFE60943202C53E268B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x96ED185C0EEC6DA69E4EB5D46DD29E74
that way."
0xEF740D68264EAE82AEEF8FFF3D8DBAE5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x2D322D7BF6AAF35045163747B6C836FB
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0xC4101FDD99B028203CBA413E55C35AC3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x18FD6B778156ED600A24FA7E4B336C30

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No! what could she do with them?"
0xFC87E5E00AB78732587EC5B97A4321D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0xD8B199DC735C3D7EE732D674CE734735
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0xD2B656745EB9A1BF379E5D6E9912EAC7
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x55D6798D35F4E34F2BA87E5808E933C2
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xA8544CBF9A2EE96A4DA179E80DF5D619
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0x336885DC61428EF7D5C81FFBBF648D5B
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x5849A44B8D8A1C7B5B73DD78FE66DBDF
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0xD0D8DB3C1F1E3CB21F96162EB6FCEBBD
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x1F6C666BAE2AF1FBE0CEF681916D9A9A
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0xC01D8AFB381E4093EB9B50E6DA1D1869
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0x1CFCAE7864ABFD76445E90A176E3B886
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x92D71F8149A19B7E967448F5C887440E
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x06A1EF0144274DA18D326D20E7A31341
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0x4B5856A03B158A7F116D3ABC8E6DCCCF
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0x59647D0F75E0128F0A45D6A64A40F6A0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0xF6029838E42D30B2CEB00592CBEC28B9
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0x54A4BD717AF871FAD94D21C4B55A9A20
said--
0xED2ABE6DED2ABE6DFFECE641E1E5B044

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x0B454D94A9976F6ACE6B6B36209FD304
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0xFBF01BC8BD718CC03E2486313F9FCDE4
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x7CCEB922922BCAF29510C0D98507B845
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x2F4D18CA6AA3A18A4DFDA8E4FF9570B4
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x297D80FCB57D60703A1B4C9C15FF7A10

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0x5EF1A18ACF73D9E7C0A848C17B806DBF
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x8CFD4E2624E721029BBA95FC8482FC01
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x68BC7FDF4232D81973B0D7CEB841F8AC
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xD299F042EF047B2AEEFEA15DF5A8961A
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x4406753576D192D28F05ABFE4C681A5A
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0x80B9B1F0D323670F433EF1EDADFD6785
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xBF41EE8936DB79F6739D8A31B26AB59E
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0x14398E5EFA9CA074AEC0C0736228215D
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0xB4A0FC3E62C9825E1148A6EFF8524C20
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x2CBF08580D52DBA79D969DE353C4197D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
0x59B445E193C6E547C9D603D0F12C33A5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0x55E4AD4CEA88106B013E87651F80930F
give her these porridge."
0x7E70FF92E6F1D7325E17A60C67E1B0DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0x958277F5F2E42D910F5FBD4573CF94D4
pig doesn't want it."
0x08ACF95263C5DD0AD37CA96083874DFE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0x70F580FDE7B4B2C99EAAAE940F629867
ravenously.
0x24010BEBC4570A19A38223582D880F38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0x0DA86AC1AA0A18ECE424B7A7AA9BDE89
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0xB3A41F6A1A9EBF5C31E3050B6A8AD5E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0x7C117304587109B0F9E130F3D029DD8E
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x5C0FE0D84103C291B5B660B8C3435F66
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0x6D5DBD9007412080EB4DFA832D465172
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0x9FEDA10196901386D06F547C9D514952
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0xC9EB16CADE85157B726AF78A13D97DD6
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0xE72D8812F256BD5CF3D7A8AF4B4753C3
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x684DE4C168884FBB5E873C8D83B75618
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xC07014791D7BB87FB7D4182D7FE5FE3E
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x3737A86A1335ED18B726F5352EB2E0AF
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0xC128A6639978E3FA6E15CA5703F77A28
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x2AA720CB9B446700D9C1104ACC96296E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0xC3E7380A7670D4F44C2397AE45F61379
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0xDC3CFEF84625B7FF3EC4C794926F39BB
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0xCA5C82E0BBFEFA851BAF04F3A879C473
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x21B48D7CCCBA1D7261232E791C0AFC11
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x7DBFFE181E61B074AC4656230D17531B
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x9FFCA460153B3C0EEFDC89B1F6BDFAD9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0x16A395CD9EDA3AF2B43725D5DEC904E9
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0xC9A57958ADF0E67D162617127FFD3156
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0x1B5BC2AC0A241E22F911B89159A817F0
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x459A0582F5DF25052F965E13E91899CE
grave."
0x09A90D7A09A90D7A180FBE9CF4FB1B68

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x30AB28BF0134A812A521C60ABCC07703
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x67B1199A6C2EF1F5B42DC8BCA3253693
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x7316B1955759DBD47E5ECAFEBCA6ACB7
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x76B5A8D6110ACFB3A9B3F94F59F039FE
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0xE674E434029F8FA238D741806823B064
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0x939DBC85C6C58E6EF407AD2A7B0FE39D
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0x4A922C16FF1F6EA7E95365B2D0917FD6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0xE99C928852B0D201BECE4DE06B6DB496
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x68F2ACCE0A25224E9E496C2EE2DAA2A3
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0xAA370C65B979BC9623CE63287F1DC801
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0xF58978D87036E6BDB6EA445CE5F0AB69
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0xF32434EA77CC14A5E2B874183CF307EF
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0x8B263290032DCF5CC423D01ABD20C341
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xDB7509F23FB170DDA75C61A8DA8233C3
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0x30BA45F0892009B03E39C885F0D0676F
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0x3CB151F5B22C55682364D990E7F314DB
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0xCFD8B790FA9AAD1D9839D0E07D737ADF
it shut in my face."
0xE1E37FE4D9BB61CFFCE345C87E7DA3B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0x3329244BB3CAAA53130CE2D60FA2E21A
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x78204BCAAE9BAE2B6F0ED320A341F863
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0xA37B08B41F3F8EECA2A04D8B34E591FE
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0x5ED310CEAD2E40734DDFBCE804B5C5EB
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0xEA6E3A7C7C62B37036142FAAB7B34B8A
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0x09524E006E4BE2A4468FEB44281C905D
long.
0x743FFBAD743FFBAD806B9CFD114EFE60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0x9B8FAD393A2D6DD5000790CA2BF9FD17
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x370BD4B1B141727F5BB45A0FB08B0845
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x1F0290C463BC6B9AE98907DDCCE2200E
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0x0A532AD2B964663D4AE2484355815365
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xDBC1E5486B9484B2419ABCF4B38C68DE
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0xE8213696B5681D64FAA9645384D45483

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0x48DFF4641E8034DB951675E5FD69514E
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x82BBEA7EF62072C8800DB9E079262276
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0xCAE0AD19976BFD47A7105BD4D876A622
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0xED241DE9C719493ACF4C3EFB8CE96260
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0x1FE7DCA754C0F6924AE32A56D562AE03
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0x528844B8CE8C9993E58078ED1A7F6FFE
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0x245D0A728DD47EBF3D3DAED696A9E770
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0x8274EBF33B4C31BCC39704F10092E612
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0x9C9DC5D352FDEB5C53BDF42906121E0F
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x87AD30CB0B4C73726CC209F2276D5DE0
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x4D44ED5A253F3B5002D9B4E51052516D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x9DD87DF388F6FF4A0E995279F6176A80
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0xC62835F6C14F862BC493502DB0636E57
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0xAF9371BAF945EB2E0EE80D33092C17DB
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0xCE3D68211C8CF4285515978D3302DBA9
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x1DC48C2791AC8DA9732EB10DF4ABA8CF
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0xD5008B79BB0E219E9CDE0625E6352B09
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0xE6ABA9B3D494B91AE0CFECCB927F6150
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x88828308C0283AD2A0F716016850F79F
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0xE910D9605355E2D9DC9B9B0E8976EADA
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0xCBF228B15E3F2C6DDD863366B8E412CA
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xBCDE4E2DE68C2748100FC3CCF0DF8DF2
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x6ACC9C2A1EB67D474CA5A97801E80D8D
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0x3EDD9C0B15F3B56C2BC84338648C0E20
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0xCADE62A58A2D434352553DE0EFD38532
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0x4E34610585464863D4EC535339046477
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0xAE343F2090D81155FA8B3B828930B023
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0xFE8816D6D7901157DA2D9659727834FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0xF6D4664549B487F2FB8D110326FFD926
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0x43E2D135EC1A9B81F1E49BA3F0D12975
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x638ADB65310AF3CCF3DCF6BA637AFA69
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xEE8E37C83F9EA352E6512ED7A877B6A3
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0x228F6BF0A2604872D3D63763A551A9BB
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0x2457359F52244353660822833FF9637D
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0x12286FDD7900065E307B3C25BB69172F
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xDB770FDA976B8738913AED6E49209013

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0x5E55EE6693A0F179C635114B4962B1CF
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x3F50EDE144BBE81F903D27747EF07450
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x4ABAB94750B309E8991F20164A46FBD6
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0x8A1832A900744D1C8B39B90480D1D3A6
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0xD72791954F2ACFB44610BF7A0BD44112
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0xAC0E5922BAD772A5A52C3B25A5B716B8
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0x53FBFEED2A641023AEEAF4FFB84899F4
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0x35A6CBF59F3BF6756A3C5AF311058EF7
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0x3595B93A90680E2A21E28BBB14001663
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x90E0C6CE4FDC34C96BD8B4FF16BF833D
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x476ABE907E4DB7098C34597ADADDA6FC
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0x7C9E0021BDBBE4D3A9CAF64FD3FF666D
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0xA4E30B80138198D903B7D4BF9CA07E49
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0xE09B7539FDA8A7B566E4DBD23DF6411A
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x4CE0D6420B638C8EC70CA3AC4529E272
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x631A7710E3FC89728511F87E7FB43B6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x1F18E00675F57B423CB0160CC091A976
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0x0287415E6F82C6D679C439A6417A3453
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0x9575E984B6732805BC9E211F05BF1041
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x88A566FB75F12B1D3C44262D7FAA47F6
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0x91011A0364DE1FFB29EA0E5F22BADA72
German I could not tell.
0xDFC4EDCF79131D58D8A4F7AFEF818A11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0x11F62786BC81D8451608B893CF22AE80
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x5DC6029CDCF165257CFABCE02B455A24
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x2C09BE011371159DBB4504E5E8D45FD6
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x1B3B28998D319AD65BFCB96F975F4427
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0x7AA8E6D0764E9431A087FB6B8D1C19B5
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0x06A8C396B060F45142310343674FF70C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x3588DDAFEDEC2BD7A519306D624551CB
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x8E0D94AC08F844586D26F1BBE5F50272
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x29291D2481B5163D7CB9B7FF1FCDFEB5
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x5628E6497D8C395D30994014F26BCFB3
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x911E4C1B9808BCA24B135E4DBB86FEF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Both were again silent.
0x6962B79018172233CD9726685FE51258

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xABE189AD3EC3ED3AAD0B0B46BE099712
looking up from her knitting.
0x57ED717E89D4FC232014BA11C95CECEA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xFB4AABAF6AC372432111510B4132FF5D
other way."
0x4D89F09AB9A9A4E18FD2851DDEFEAB11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0xE1AC95A0EDA85D44934207F2F740C42B
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x733587803803759E908705C02086B7F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x76004A5DC401FC71EB1B7293B16629F0
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0xB335FF5037523462A62DAE54F1BA675A
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x73FE3FCBA5DDBB9F5FFF4543EE3DEFCB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what good does it do you?"
0x12D0D9112B63534493A93EA989AEC409

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0xD90EF3EEDF43D6FE74871731FD388ADD
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
0x2E478A2AF8E10275FAC20B2582FE2175

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
0x3B8C94D417A3402E9BB44B72CE1877EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
0x2049DD88586DEB93B6CAED84FB5D1025

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
0x7B695618655951A920704F5B4F7373A9
master but a lexicon."
0x017ECB82D173221D9180725B033EE811

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
0x3793961DEED8AAEF77001EBF5CE5A88D
I wonder when St. John will come home."
0x503F5D5343F776D1CCB8399A1B78D1FF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xA1DBEBA8B774211028C8D59475FDE28E
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x2306D93BBF135B15A4BB71526FF41CAF
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0x3D42F8F8E498B7964CE7B177C0E7D2D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0xC71458027D5478F5212D9F3A69C13D82
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0xD728FA32C9DDFA780C21CBC68271AAFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0xF9FF6B6FB4D7842935F34D9E131AF94C
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
0xD554E93864B715EB2BCB2F0F1CCA3FD3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0xB5338B67DBC9A8782077359661AF0E76
sad now.
0x8A138BBE32ED260D0538DE9980A1260C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x2D68AD59CB95EA62522D322A9BF3D396
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0xF1E0A08F64385CD5E11A2A4E3B40E8C0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x1EA01FEE5E3084109956C20B8998EB7B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0xF423F12D24B5E75BA8D673A87ADFCA59
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0x064CF83FC00D5C6EF8AA9A3DF04E580D
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x189A462DC0FC5B50F3E97B536160D6F3
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0x0DC66BA29D35CEAA1EEFEDC42C75F887
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x03287DF5368F7622F20AA9202C327484
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0xFD9AB13E45E0DAF1D362F0FC1BFE523D
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x00635C57CB5BD928F6F06D487B905A70
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x69165756288ACF836725EF0BB3C10C62
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0xB4BB2FC3A78E41A5D8A74836AA804F6C
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x84A6A1B34B84D737CE6B0098D9E59A02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0x9311E98798084C41EC2BA2A651DA06CD
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x9C67125A881A85D72DFDFB38AF1E4B1B
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x909976A63B3096665C40143D7218EDE4
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x32490664E64F6E04FE133722861ECFFE
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0x51BEA02D465A56B41F77EFBB65E11B85
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x334978FEFC952E1CCBA8B547CE7FFCDD
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.

"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0xF58A2D3062B01114AC5854B1179C0FDA
St. John when he comes in."
0xC942D1378709D47851627B7DE05F3CDB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x2DB97E5156A50CB25EB0C66F38C55F8B
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0xD3A035E9A2DF7D9108063B95A847559B
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0x66EBBDD2C20B1DD4570022350C600E51
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0x9D5C290C738E76AA7889A10AD771F39F
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0x463D976B1896C52EAACE12552B344B8B
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0xB4005BCD7F795D0AA6FC48B7379EF1F0
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0xAA9653ABC859BEA477D309B38DC07489
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x96B67A60C519807FFE3EFE7431F4B774
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x82566A864584DF7D63350926590875C9
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0x89A9A30E2A56DE9D3A7E2CC0B1ECFD00

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x197F142B5E906217AA90C7F1CCBAF454
me by the light of the candle she held.
0x17ADAECC0555959E55A1B1D689180BDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0xE00ABE5D5D1D3DA49439C262D681C844

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x8D1C7E06824BEF9F850ABF64D23DAF22
from?"
0x7CA250747CA250742B2B73CF067A9FC9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am a stranger."
0xC936F4C46F6D776C51CC53750FBC7B9C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0xA7CBDEB23801CCC1E28FB9024C240F11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x8492A5DFDB8B1A4637AE56860ABFD452
bread to eat."
0xEC0041D83FC95081E92EDB08109BE898

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x1789D5C37B955E1093C5AA47522ABA0C
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x6C4A08CB7AFD66EB73B9EDDA0ED86E89
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x5EB7CA1F2ED0EA918B3CBD90849361BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0x565D509984E4E539620EC1BDC11851F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0x7A035C1114F3F7D18A150A37D84596EB
now; it looks very ill."
0xA6258F1B4388278E2E4CC6723CE04E35

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x7126C9B8F9D841A44749D0F15CE30915

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0xA020F10CD320F6D4076BA8AF2106EA07
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0xB80BE7D2EA33814F5B51868711633E0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x5F3DB7797C2916C706006EE4C95306B4
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x6C760B8CD63E2265ADB8791CDE6CEC94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0xA181496C59158BDECD441024E66A3A09

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x31926CA71B7DE7BEFC678328024FDDEF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0xFA366BDE3E524A1FE297BCE5284F1440
make such a noise.  Move off."
0xBCBE0ABC7798095178E43FDECA49C6E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x194B9DA3AE207C840E542AA3E2652D17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x8A32591C7A34291D8526C17FE44C204D
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0x697698EDA1477F86237988A8AE3018D5
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0x21D21679C9E2DC6ACE97BA358515FDFF
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0xFFE015887F9249B9349BB96CB387F77D
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xBD20805C31DBEDA92339C9F4743B030F
bolted it within.
0xDCEE9E13149010A24360D20978F5CB91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0x7E60EFCC61D10E1E3D9FABC27602166E
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xA6D48BE2625D1F17807CF924E9D2CCFA
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0x69CD03AAB7D8AEE109582F0B8AC4AD6F
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0xBDFAFF38CA3F909933FC958CA8C927C3
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0xED719176E0887F1E2524269BCBC46917
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x2F129EA2D076F1567B3E30A276F91A39
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0xCFF9D95CD21CF5E21C8A9CCFACEDD785
endeavoured to regain.
0xF3C217DEA07354CEF9A3319A2A65EE51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0xBA4EE59559633E8DF8358908E25AE335
will in silence."
0x05141117F2C8382DE80BD0A500519917

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x954BBA7A99BCFFB7A4DBEAFDDD4E29E9
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0xE5BD685A03A17D9325159DFB7A69F7F3
and still.
0xDF43CDD86FE0D61E89B69EDC12D90D84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x6D61F342C1C58D92BCBF276FAEFB3B4E
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0xD8EDB8EDD19AAA14A16D3CB978248320
if you perished here of want."
0xAC386C3D3FF5611358B0EC7F0224F93E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x3ED2B36A9AF00798A3B288E03753DA90
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0x6CB96E218D430F334644B62802311103
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0x2526B35A29C61FA425D741AB5CB9DF84
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x01B604742D6669C62E9E1C56BBB98968
to the door.
0x91A42EAF661CE48ADC5EADD935D1FBA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0xD378AD1C622FCF9A8F83C601BE427B55

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0x5B3483FBD31FE6A51828F612F0DDE605

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0xCF85E1D100D2C032A56EA033E5D3900B
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x0E1C429562FFAEDEAC91F073BD300C0C
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x2D3B4C2823E8443BAB8BB2D1BA7D83D9
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0x1EC0D6CBCE38701D3FCC712FF4978FB0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x6EB14CA16961E61D260392EE4E69583A
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x65B698C7360472128F04B50D26859292
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0x0F224A2F46BAAFCDACE82B5C2015E2C5
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x7A167E850FB3E67B486CC667F1CF0D21
house."
0x9424B9139424B913FDA0D74A683ADB19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x2651B43162A4BBE2E88A9F6F4929BD3A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0xDA48AC266B58D6A49504B5B97B9AB0A4
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x8D387093FEAA1FD61589643921BCE0DC
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0x746CA96D342F1C470F5E914E472C0E31
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0xACEA353ED346565B5D117BE1C10BF482
me.
0xD786AAADD786AAADD786AAADFB021C99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0xFDD290F87B97077D721D09CC881E272F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xB39601265E871707BD1B08A56BE046B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0xA448B2490320B8C66E2A876A1649FBD6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x1CC6AA6A3142BFE371AA50D841569006
sit."
0x3DBBE8F03DBBE8F05221811342B671DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xA41A18AC413FC6999647E45929D00C6C
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x75949A4936E4E2CDAD8B61D1C8639793

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0x283B38FB6A0A6BEC9E1A0EDB2447EF58
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0x5F0996D57444F32235DCEBDB51F930E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A mere spectre!"
0x5447354B49E4AED945388A130AC86974

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
0x7D5A1F1C93968C0C294C86B7380BD57A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xAE23037A9B36F1BECA671A900F66C451
bread."
0x0B5EBDEE0B5EBDEE77687BCBA46411A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x34E35817E295CD457D62E1A97D0E17B3
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0xC8AF3F83FBD637138788E2FAC43AAC29
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0x6CE5792DB7353A82703E5A76799E78CC
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0x3F3D6C629B3EDDF19153AE510EBF44E4
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0x09D781820FC506E5E8D8B132E36EC301

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0xF23688E24F71BCF5DF36BF8EF74904B0
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0xC360BA1CFE33A14DCBE52169F8C7397B
first, eagerly soon.
0x0C60746B6E4307F73119C68284048793

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0xE68042D06E23F50C0B19CB63A4093386
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0xFB6A202896648A27721C33194380ADB8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0xAF0BBFF82BEF3BC194B9CA285868DB21

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x3371B5909A0BDFD1B012B885FFAC25D1
name."
0xF5BC8C07F5BC8C0713D45834C778B4D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0xA9B14F7DB46C8B95E18523C460888200
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x3AE432EF4846A03685C41AAF4DDA7284

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x2F390AD1D2021C17EE2F6957740D45E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was silent.
0x195D1BEB625ACEBF7EC21698D71F8CA0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x75281E64DB232E35CC7905B2D44068FB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shook my head.
0x8874CD36F668C38EE01B4AA76F16E795

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x240393F588A0CB165E935B528CDC4F5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0xDD5E2AE02F082DA0877C1CB1B10CB7E4
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0xE732BB7B4FE4C5153A57513F9DEE62A9
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xD2DD5972F8E328FE28411042F12F0CE9
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0x9D3C28F40917179C71FD8E7D510E9AD2
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0x3A337D6B7B9C38F4209E322473971934
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0xD00BECE0DE29498A92503F78E7C00060

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x45F447F53F8C087A8ECAFA3D731A2FD8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0xEE99DFD0BE2EB3566EA574D37CBF01CF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0xB7787D1CCA8BF1975E5613450E23F707
took the word--
0xBED8B556B31B04787B825DB699962ADA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x341189AFD3EAA45E88A95FA4D14FA33F
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0x24BCF86682E00C431CCC54EF8FC9218B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0xD10C8D5933273B68F94AB3D2C66C2585
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0xB1B20E10725C0A4365621327D1E4823B
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x3CE4FB056B97C469A4B7E786E53EA098
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0xFE7B037EE81C2345D92619BE5190EEF2
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x8A530E470B437EEC29EE24672E8899D9
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xD2F86CAA3D54D43934C6723B4CCF2D7E
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x93230058B35B8870D34852BF740557D1
silent.

"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0x39ABFED3C7D29DE2122519050903921C
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x922B8C711AF595F93EE9BB8C7111171A
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x065227205838FE5CB0564EA6C603ACC4
matter over."
0x7606B0F16AA59DC6186B28A9C1F77839

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0xE615715FE3B9C52AEEF0D6B5DBEDF45C
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xEE6FC8CE98B9F8540544768B243D751F
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0xF075DE85EDF02D6F50B5CE336A2F23DA
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0x922685E26A35E2DABCB8E2E765F76EB3
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0x86AE5B85E69BC02F21818F401894CA45
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0xFD966FB56B8E65FC224853888C79C558
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0x9F364A675AEBF68A8F07C1EB0C0595D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x8AD142A089CB0852D4D7423F6C0F9854
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0xC25922FE396BDB867D63746DE68B3D8F
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x4225FCFB1B0264D1B6350C5B39539D0D
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xE9B1ACD58B230F152387F41A4519DDB7
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x3398CAB242E5B9840536633055630B50
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0xA83F3F17A0C9A12F609A90709DA260AB
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0xCAC4D0E933F197EFA923E5C4CCBB8698
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0x83D2364B4715E52B73F81A06EA44F954
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x862B7CB7F87EE8ADDA7DEB805EF98A84
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0xF2F864EEA4B83986204CE5F0244E44CB
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x44FC125E93C50A3A9C86893E1FABEC95
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0x31754E36228F29E12562C87443FC8508
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xDEF5C89E4B187F34BEADA53F4052B058
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0xAB304C2F4BCCB23024F1B1CF18DB9595
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x2A6891CA8474FEFD7C639040AD62E142

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is very well we took her in."
0xE5CB40CC06D2D094A5EB28CDF29D402C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0xC6CEFB0BE8B3B9A835B84E764FC7D102
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x39DB7FA2C94710035D18A8B5894CD545

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x305A1F2C2974EC4C597972256BE054D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0xE524D2AF28C54B9706298CBD3B284A57
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0x17D1945A9C9A022E08FFAFBB4FFE72B6
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0x8CEB459ABCAC142BEC2ABCEE8A1C4592

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xD1FFEF5E1FF9D7856B171FB67E2683B4
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0xCD083697994DFCB2C3B4B46DB57F1249
would be agreeable."
0x95600FA643E462ABD724798B0A202CE4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0xE282270F75BB146C58462987E941B454
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0x3A93244B4CA6D196FC0B8D7AB682A8F1
myself.  I was comforted.
0xD2504B577E7D692D182EBC89651584DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0xCFCE014EB2A9AF87BFEEF45430AA99B9
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0x1F199261D45009B55F51C0DC1DA77523
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0xD0187526B3341B15FDA8940008741149
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xA0EC04E6323DE2ED4B9A30F5EE2F0654
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x8DBA0F1FD9520CC74EB836C8F484B2DB
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0xCD2CFADF28A507675A2CDA9623734C34
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0xDBA9CA26B1E77246159A9EB527B0C41E
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0x3C1D8500E99F15C2EA0AA4A6456980C9
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0x0F006A175590F04B2615DE24EBAA0B1B
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0xFC0F41951366FCD75D7185A465AA8D2A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x6DB89756686856E1B4349C6C4A3E31E1
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xAA3E7131129F35D1151DD11E298D219E
her permanently."
0x850F22BC0FCF4FD69A7C458165B5BCA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x7338948F7D808E9EE1707DEA838277A6
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0x08DFF8E729103D5FD7FB2AF9680D43CF
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0xD02BD0E026B82A50FC33C40A3545F246
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x356F9F15940565A7A80414C07C8C6D97
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0x43ABA0069CE918779DE34BAEBCDB9C1F
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x4C44CAF5765D1842FAFAD9734E90AB06

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x3DFD36C1DB3932B4790EEB648381B173

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0x4632747CD2092AA7B7D6C912E1105FFF
are quite wanting in those features."
0xEEAD05AB923EF58D8C2550009FBC50A8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0x830AF185AC7EB0A22A181FB4AB0991FB
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0x22DE3651806564E1261C365DD75B55AF
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x71077B9714844A7743281FE39CB79A3E
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x061DBB2C5449ADA85A7ED350A92D1E43
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x902BF25D7DCCC846FDDAFBACE145C79F
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0xD8B8BF9177D2223E1DFFBFDDEE78C5AB
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0xDAE1A796A78BF214786690DA04DF9358
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0xEC118D4598FE03D04BA424F2980367B5
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x836A15A2D6B4E53303F08076B0A72A15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0x7DC7398FC8BD9C44EF43A95855143FA9
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0x3AF53A20FD4BCF8BF2CF4C9F2B193E5A
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0xFB8AB6816CF4096CCAFCD0E25237170A
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0x84E1CBE02D8F11747B40BAAFD9D15445
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0x7A8AACA83313055A8EDAB66EA26C7CA9
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0xC2B3BBF879837F9CEE65464C9EE67B2A
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0xCCE42AB84CEE7969369ECE933AC1CF5F
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x38FF8B6B64932D6362D792FF97F372D0
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x6959161BE2076DEF27066B1EE734ACE3
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0xC94C77776D0943FAD5C6FE421A105035
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x79A67EBE397A50B16E4964A33976F8FB
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0x792536451403C261E8BBB07E3C7AF295

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0xEA89E1B76141B171BBCC96A41C5F7A89
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x00DEA45FAD528F64F457E75E6566FD9B
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0xB09E330102199056F5A340CEF4715034
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0xEB2B64DD08FF304D9A837781FA75998B
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0xBDFF6456E2B26CBA5B96E582DFD77F89
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x54748A1D1BBA9AECB8FD54EC3D3DF59B
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x5C3E3C728B82CFCABA5FF42795303DE5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0x40117EAC9B69B2ECEBE6AEFB09EC2AFB
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0x6E55E95EDFCFB921C51E3A2A8924760C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x4EE226FE8B9C0427CD2CCB0A1993775D
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0xC1480AFD7F18720D900A1B1B1C6438BE
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0x9F6A28FED1649F2E7EABFEE8326276C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0xA2FA80D635037F669975A1E6686AC521

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0x745E3B37CC77E33E6329E9D1E59182AD
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0xB9263DE1828E33E5FC3ABD306637D92A
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0xF74957B9EDABD5192265CD6603D60FD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x9E4A28CBC23570F3A27F1122B9DF04F0
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xF19956B3E2264782385623051AA36D15

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0x76EEB0FB06779F4592498330B62C4944
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x8CEF2599B6CAC68E7D0CCF64E0B9914A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0x8F7510CEDB89A62CC42466A920AB2CC7
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x6A21D63CCB7D3696C490000879736EC3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0xDA4174DA43BB6B083997B52253B7BC34

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, very."
0x32DAFF78EA6A7E1606791CAF43A8D4AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0x8B528EDB0B86CC3EADADEE1135F30084

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0xACFF3BEF94146941E2CEBC451561AF4B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x4C94AE4B40A834F6F9D48140E2703742

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x4B903E5E71C3C27EA956057325F844A5
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0xCB83BD294E5E96D7DEBC66BC4643E2FD
basket of the fruit.
0x017B5C7ED21F5D3EA9BC44DE6ED664F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0xBFA5A12978EB1A58E62E45B7066729E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x70B2F5B2514710422D563371A42391DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x58F9482B3825F87E0A608673DA81DE65

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x4964B536E0BF08BF58F2285284933965

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0xE52CE61FFCF0A9E0C33F912F6D08BC87
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x575E25FD08B93CB537A2FB663B975607

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0x76A7918F86F1B5E90DE2E85A0B64D1F1
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x30FDA5ACE902C0F71A2AD65B8CCB0616

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xE76422DA73783E3355077F3EAA21F053
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x84498A73563416A73132C2D43CCFDF1B
are."
0xB34440DCB34440DC5EDF80F6937E69D4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x4B6D2FCAB8282BA08DC35330D47F6D3C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xA2F5BECDD529FFE84ECFE95907CA7124

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0x9837D8CF5143823811F79E4658DBE990
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0x9E4B0E872BAFA30C287B742054FC3BE0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That village a few miles off?
0x529B6A39AF2BD747E1662F7A3FD4B3F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Aye."
0x136E1F75136E1F75568DD3E68720CDF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what is he?"
0x38D41CF74B14081354DE8862F60C0181

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is a parson."
0x26C86F29533059189A7536DFDE300A68

I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x6E2507D6A9D2F667654B8CBF2D570984
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x7BA9F3FCD29B1DDB8C8035DB868069D4
residence?"
0x36C882F007EF77D6B213AAAEDB3D88C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0xE0F51A65FD00DDB13E66F31B0FDBC48C
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x8FF50CF816B12A192632BB6ACC7F30A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0xF09A5802948A7F42B13B1165A1E4C2D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0xC9B7F16AEAEC9B44EE41BD7948FFDB18

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0x1571B686BD997AC87BFF5CC9A8EB158E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Their father is dead?"
0x491D93589DCDC719015679BDC6186F6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0x9934D226E6ACB08FEF962A5A17DDDA46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They have no mother?"
0xC75BF7E996AA05503E37AB14510DE3B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x82CE367EF069FF100EF7BC71EC857CC0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x66B2526FF715A22844993B9E421ED2E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0x34B90FB198F31DA6B2D16624495C3E50

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x6FDF23DA274D4578DB7D1FD0C4F23921
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0xBE88328556C04E3F6FCDEC167E176B39
beggar."
0xCC6A6B1EEE28A309492F36E04CB04685

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0x41A08F119CCFD6C865BB268636457EA9
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x888357EB693C999DB779F097787A83D2
goes about, you mun forgie me."
0x86B998E6E9930A9D8BCEF7954B9154E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x895FA4D91BC17C21FE2B09C21C52051D
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x840D4BB0AC6B9F10002FB5802A0BAEE3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
0x409A0655285DC8A5D001BD23CF4479E8
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
0x24A7FDACCCBC64B7BACB497A84E2C8A5
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0x2F7E21430B913024903FA03EF3AE3A54

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x5DCACAD57565CDF5CA444D0E4535ABAB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0x67F31FA11D2DB66E3BA61225B31E1937

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xC8BE0AD4B2814AD3D586D9C553B20D57
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0xA8893CD97D42B2ED00A82DA45239D690
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0xB4711F55824A7C28823713E4B02228D9
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x79E1872D62F1DE1C8AEC23E61D9630C8
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0x8F9F542691A3EF54C6FA7453645F59F4
to consider poverty a crime."
0x4EFDDB360B3E935AC31B60A9EC44757C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0x5601B2937AE35112C1DDA819F35B9884
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x896CFAC51607D920BE0A15BFEF9747BA
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0xAA6FC49BAC1A83360B2211703C08EBDF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x4BFE7ACA74219310B2E73DD16191E5D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x1D658B91286AEDE1986FE72136B56E34
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0x86967DDD7DC801F9004AB23C6817B8AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0xA3B6B83AB14521829914DEA4C525823A
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0x1A49C7D3E6D1D918DE9C85C5D3EA4ED4
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0x0C2BFF84C7566EC1C5C88A46D956AB66
the young people.
0xC1296B9287034C7B334DBF50A6986E5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x9BD8226342784B014272A75AF75D373C
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0xE94C1C4E28A10AA4265F32CBE6512DAF
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x8D13B3A9B3720CBFF41DF10F5D55DD3F
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x885515E68237C087617A40C3296B9BEA
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x84BFA5A7DE07B1CCEF9D13EF000EBBDE
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0x0BB31F1AED9E3AE2A4C631F3D54B9B4E
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x36A191801FE245D2A8F1DBE75A0B5C39
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0xD419E64C77D1C44F23B80EA505D82E1F
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0xDD37C404BFD916484480E07412D8E89C
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x85CE1AD66A73EF2900CCC8FBC1D647F5
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xA4C0837837B6A275A855102860E003B2
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0x933242C99014ADDD978340334868B529
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0xA5E00344A3A44CFB56D99A9B7AEE0FE1
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x229D5CB7ED7612BF2F970BBD87F34AEE
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0xFA82763B5A193F7E0E860E209A9718D4
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0x92501A7FF8568AC3E9ADCA03666FAC86
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0x8F547AE36524B8496E7F7E7BA15EA256
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0x97D490062A56522BED980F90DD9B34FF
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0xDA8B15974D9DF41C3748D5E184C8B9A2
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0xB19179CEA0A4556B92F3F927A3D485EC
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x065D77DD2632DD1FDE667F83AE78D3F0
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0xBE90D065FB446818C461DD81B8729B93
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x6560510307EE8984BE215823DAB49B9F
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0xB4B29EC03374111946E26B46CAF004D6
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0xAF80D4B1F1197FB66951A90B5C7A38D4
for being united.
0x1EE0C75EC57C3D5CB9B071B474743615

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0x9A5AF1A02A8FE800A6E86C5282BA89ED
ladies and their brother were now.
0xB53F1E01553AE9F2F1B97E714083AD32

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x3355C032F4AC0C4BEA3F32DB587EB402
to tea."
0xBBC7D3F4020CA347ED3F051AFB6B472B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x741BBDD353145CDBCD52A627DBE75459
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0xE1E6CF018819B407683A0D9DE59F0E5F
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x9D03C1C9EB0A345B6245BD80925280CA
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0x00BBB59E9FD0B55D5B51D9DF7C151350
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0x03A71616DCE97C75C363FC4F08D805D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0xD2D9C9C767C9AD2B990C49818701E215
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0xD9088210F846AED87A43E053357781CC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0xC480252287DF2832DF850362AD8EA534
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x51EC49049DC170E426BF6FF327AC3290
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0xC534DD52F6A98277C3B47E6A9EF49704
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x6E8E14811BF1800C986DF3C2DC4A1FE4
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x2CEF798428FBA0FEC5BE816C45EBF582
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0x3147532FB0F7D48CABFD6B173F55E269
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x8400DC8C11EC1A4A519AB2F4E9CA5DA7
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0x3C11FF56349647580D5F95E373F7995B
will.
0x7AD70BD67AD70BD6A491C19825A6A9D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0x88DE99D28E6A439673AB7F86EDB0C1AD
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0x2DB0600FDDF85643AD650C060F872FDA
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x90EA4463CE3E0DD1E806A7E2E037978A
parlour."
0xDEFDCF8FDDD7C6205A272AD7064A8B01

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am very well here."
0x23DCFA40F82EAC52AF23BDF30EEB1AA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0xD7D762832AE532E6D3438323EA4756AF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0x3E0C406CCFF4490E7C2B851E1720282D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0xD9A2551C9803F080FE921DC9989929F0
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0x8EB7CB8E38A2A14020866F3D43843E6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x2FE678357F7DDDE8A9D64CB530376A9F
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0xF2CB58284BD9A1146B671C941366BCFA
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0xE04ACC6E27B55DE7F85BEB75E5E72A1D
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xDA0C343C60A444AF5C94C0C7BE6D2A14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x493B1A630C43350FB5684A370187D64D
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x6DBAD3693056246C55B7DDA6AFE56EEF
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x4524EA107BD6EF9140E84545F170F576

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x4100E454ECD08397EB404A8E380672F1
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x70EAC2FE25B22122F231DDEA0726FBD0
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0xEA50EE49A119CF6190FE4F77E6CDD2D3
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0x5C57FEE64592685D4CF7D585795B654B
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x443FAF6EF87814A40D796297567D3363
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x58800C7EC73BC34972638202D3646622
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0xBBEF1F26401F15DC3DCBB05C6EA003DF
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x6026BEFEA9EB8D535D34552D6F397E40
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x9D2F49B247E1DF731EB3C3D7A9D88904
and well saved.
0xA25735445F860AB2CA1CFA185DECA743

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0x801998F27B1703D0AF6E3B971A7B69F9
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0x14A5252E41F6AE5A05BBA55F11874020
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x276CD903C5F56DC39587DB1269A73333
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0xC53C95F85067C53DD57990B9CD7A8E70
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0xA57E38FF3FAA08813FEFA231B6BC596E
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x1E3B2471ADDB7E5FFED180DD3F7F1DFB
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0xCB2D19AEBE1B1F55A7B02CE1431368A6
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x2DDF7B5934AF23B7CCE2C8DC6DD19C4C
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0xB9B5D12BEEFA0C1DDBBCF692329BD48E
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0xE71574148872A9D9D887CB354086AC53
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0x375D0B5C84D8BEB549754F4A90F508CF
fair hair.
0x59AA5ACB20429FAB5423982F3613FD5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x00E4EED3C4787B0C7161F5DC7D04DA59
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0xEE0CA63984E27EDE6C7A4578F49D5C0A
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0xE90FEC77DEC1A40C0C094FB9CC14FE15
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0x1678A75EFC26677EE3B3E053BED91DA8
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0x0D33D1C24438BD700A937C2B24207B18
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0x1FB54B84E760C8087E9979BC4CBA59D3
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0xC9BE373A2C806A02ADCD800C66E43581
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0xACDEC2CBD2221B07EBF9D0295C64D43A
of the oven.
0x0363A66EDFF76B360ABCC18653CF564A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0xE082543E98B2F1214D5BE42F97F42104
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0xD8C3FE8E1B578468794EF5443DFD85BE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0x44F5A39E3212AC29619416C544035AFB
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0x15949D2D52BA56FFDEEBB17431676445
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x9856D1E64B1AC834E8722FD6929EC750
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x83F8A2ED94D3134600E8B20A6B0E7751
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x4795EAD9C601AC560BF193F39008383F
from the stranger.
0x9E9A1630E79B3BBB16404D47066BFF85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x02B9CA9BC057D5E5D9AB99FBCB76D43A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0x7EA298E386A22A6B841D4ABA024C9EDF
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0xC291463F9D358094BC61E370F868F5B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0x2667E6AC368DAF4013BFB135AF7025BF
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0x16B27662882E95A26A7F31632B3090C5
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x5AB4645BAF798B7ED6A91B9732329830
immoderately."
0xF49C91D5A64D200380209054DBE1445D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x1D9AC53E9B1F3106306F5EA1D7FA5796
contrived, unpolished answer.
0x04AEC1500D001C24D98981536F377E9F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0xAEEE0EF8179104D8372717A70277EC38
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0x2C8FC1FB06DD14AC65E7D230B514ED82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xD83A920A8B39874A5FB60109C451B8E0
absolutely without home and friends."
0x447DA628EEF0DA492A6E9338D2461395

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0x09B5B0116804BA57E4326888A48FD9F2
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x3372AB6C90B8E1AF4530EC24030B47FB
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0x08D8DB32686F192CDBBE784B0F094441
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x2435120B2CF1E1B19F71F9C3963DE6FD
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0x33E3D3903817A1E347CA704BE2B26307
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x2993CA8745FE6E5FF78B89FAD9E9F602
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x5CC4BF385CD349A964616CF441AFB8AB
to encourage.
0x0C7D77264898E218FA477AFF5133F916

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0x05571B91D7C5DEB112E920C36B698128
every connection?"
0xBBA6A2B4BAFF3CFD601AEAF247CA66CF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0xF0CB8D96334ECEB712CE6996F3E89867
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x2F3B3C18CE341BD5C24378DD629A3155

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x60443A8DAC41D44A2CDC1AF9A310957F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x1122426F616D155C5AC63A2EB2C08F30
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xE8BAC287B3EEE099D7A131ED3C3CCD16
explained the quest.
0xEFEA41C6A8D502FA5B68F9CAE6C39A60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x5526748C7B9FD835741B4FB1B55241D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0x1C798F64A7C9648EFF1EAE9F3D91E434
St. John," said she.
0xC3B1F7F81FCE12FA43F7BC542EAEF28E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0x22645557373EF545FDD2520D9614DAB5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x02EB991A05F274E960AF3C98F79A8EA2
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x9EE2A0B8E0654D09EF6BCE111C479A82
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x5C7052A789CE2D2E05579E15E7EFC741
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0x5448FFC7504250A809F8E952E6E20D3D
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x716119312043024B8ABA58B47D7605CD
out tears as well as colour.
0x751DAE1C0BC21E7A35A6C126DF6B9958

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x91EB7F166C0AF6EE3988E1C1F07F2E7C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0xB5EA1C8B6ED590D8DDDCA6243DD6FD28
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x42611342C4E936FFD68E6E9A85F2A1C7
piercing look.
0xE0133C299810BB55807C707FFD310D1F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x5265A6458899D3CA2B6BA3B54258B431
secret," I replied concisely.
0xAA1EDE12E166B7BA812DC7750368B027

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0xCA6A4307DC9A2E286EB7200328EF7467
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0xD91BA1E4C9A730EACF6ED71A884A958A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0x1FE33911FDF255D5F728C0C47CBA2B1C
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x52543CA283A7DEA61D4CF21D5A141C6B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0xCD279F9817985F247AAE5AB45FFF3780
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x3AC69D4F3B7A1F98758127EBCA7F94E8
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0x0B5E5B7E12C6555E550A5AB2B1111E14

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0x895401A4670D762D2E24AFD2849BFC86
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0xE1C16CBB36377473DEE80C133532411C
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0x19F11ECA952DA610EA92343D8969059B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0xAEE7DA15F70D1AA31ADEB486B2B6F99D
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0x6235C8E943331053D0E69FB4D1054EC8
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x58753E02127122A3E267A08820CF4F3A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x4E2C73F9C088CC2F9C10580CB46D2A48
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x66FF6BBC50F90443C3F506AD411272B0
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x8ADD0E814A0EC28C42F97DD820E0CD26
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xA87349ABA11E8B6BD4D357E53AE2A185
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x65A9A5B0C9CFCDA4C2E6FFB4EE2E00EE
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0x92EAFC945D64687F502A5B2CB91BFAB8
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0xAED0B5D2B28B92E530E0A8272DA4B063
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0xC52DB2C5813E4957BFB817835311960B
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0xC473B0D010F1C4C9A9ACDE44F3C47ED1
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x2F14F193729D8FDC4909D5339BDB2987
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
0x856F9F595A4D7E9ECE3DB857999DAB96
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
0xE0EB904CCD1B4557A65D783439D14441
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
0x2AE6CEE33A1AADB9B04AA014D5BD528D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
0x830228BC4530AECEEEC07C67CC70455D
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
0xE356F7E6D6E45658E3B53CF1908007CA
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
0x9EFF5493380536365304BB1DB691CA22
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x367A76EC5F5F98FB8B2FC82F70D004C8
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0x76340D390E1E9ECD763F2A3900EAF292
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x80B215AB33935D0715ED121BE7474FA9
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0xA7B8AEA6E0439A08663BA67DC616EA27
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0xE07A8AD068A2C79D5F6D8270C53BA0A3
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x2F0EA13CFF73FB2B1C0676FF67E9AB09
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0x92E9FAC59CD9B7C9B0C215A6A1204E17
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x78E871C7DC83086EB0ED491D4F2900E2
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0xA5577C934DC0193D9A9C1E8E0FBA11A1
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0x7B1429DFBFE25E41BDE9465E9995247E
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0xFCEBF56BF69E2D6866B85D6ED172149B
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0x96102D7290B453BF71D96690705D6C75
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0x09ADF7DC4412047E0C1D5045A87980A8
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xE3A58F39128FCA2CD9D4E91F8CDA12EF
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0x1C49683DFEF25F3A09FAEA142114D58C
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0x0769832F8A0597B012BFDE36A1FCC0A8
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xB4271315BA57FEB728C0087FD90A6CB7
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit

down now, Miss Elliott."
0x11F82ED25F2F343EBD027421A70C8111

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x523E74C10AA04530D0B90857EC762EE1
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0xE374F75ADBF8888C36CE6A16282949F3
once.
0xAA3E441CAA3E441C753EE8F63F17E51E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0x0D2E68D19739693A870697BCD9E26D60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x848D9F3B9321FD5CB939583E12186DE5
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0x9B0DBB934ED024B76713B8B0AE951688
sounds strange to me."
0x553AE9DE96AFE23C4FEB4F8F2A3680AE

"Your real name you will not give?"
0xE8DE7F2A6D0E219F5EE948C4ADCB2A50

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x64C247ABC25DAA4C6D485A52D8807E48
and with as much acumen as ever.
0x5DF8C19D39E79F415B53B637AB4DA5D8

"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would

"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my

head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative

"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen

0xE72CB509CDC0DCB806631CBE11FB07DA
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x239496E9BE7A9A9BC78A37448A6346C7
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the

servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0xBD320E1C3BDC0BC7C229A2A592C0AA2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x967C606F7AAD6D22E3FD7487A2FB7182
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x6512B18C84D6810E19668C042CC9D72A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xC28450B9799F59D29A7E6B474E616311
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0xD60AE19C3F988BA74EBFC6A03C197062
present strength would permit.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0x40B02DECC012C52E9A466F7AEEBF7A34
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x146C18A8200A9EA77B77D74D02838347
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0xE70590A44794B348AE5DBAA02CE25BA9
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x79DCB73ABB6577BEBE33F1D7969A0104
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x9060770515BB26F919E15305F4FB0DFA
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xFF189DBF7035F71E1801D9D488D5AEE3
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x9A8C31DB2DA17B1C421F557D73D152B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x16529A57A5F23105946FE18B7BE97379
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x67C2E736CC72F4C725FA33BFE5F9C397
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0x1212FA30DC95CA6DA2E2005C50526BD3
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x9311176B6A64581119F95DBEC72F9473
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x3B4EE7F2C35781F7F67A321478855983
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0x07BA947AEE8F572125746D7A6909B666
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0x4762E37E884656C99BDE8E990BE5C712
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x61CE78672ED527E31B496E1D8670AB6C
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0xC94992BC5C406825F3D1B25A665DBAB5
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0xFA8C36E3D66CE68333B310296DB40A63
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0x19D0A6F42E0E727D48D57827015EF246
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0xD77086427877BD525E436B9307A9F4A5
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xEA95FA01430C9D3A1522540B4F724497
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x195B1041BE4143C12DB4D71521A45D4F
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x33E75FCD0F26FBC19C0CCCD58A339DD8
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x542743D7C4E86AB8ACA5FB902E013707
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x8FCCA814B6AA5DE5303D88F0A87B9AFE
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0x8EEC1D563DA6CA35932C121BDE188238
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0xC2A719B65906EA8183D128AD36C02AA5
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0x360DB51F758875F28E2207EC1B41829B
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0x2E2AE88EA1DA8ADFE116A8980C4CF5B4
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x71395A8F4941AAFA4DD97C35618001F2
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0x4A9FACF681FB6F62E1B31DC54261223D
that entranced theirs.
0xC55D0F9AE4DCDDB92F163B54B4EF754B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x974D87435580555B9849E092C4961776
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xCC868972FD301D9EF7D8E3AB2E8264DE
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x6B42A155699FF54857811B223914EEB4
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0x0C0372E324FD28B1602CF1098CB2799C
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0xC66AA93850A2037890D992D620582562
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0xF5150FCC2EC65EE0A19CD5480C9D2347

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x271382A41031E0D475DC89DA7910ACC1
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0x6738A9405B3C3A7F5C01C5FF098108FC
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0x24B5604C24C41FD038765119E7E52925
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0xE1B9FFAF628741DBFE26965931E3FC27
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0xA45F0F942F1C0FEFB1CC2378CE368AED
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0x04E8B236D644A444738E7789462E58EA
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0x6494D9CBAF0A4F1E0A7879ECE5B54C92
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0x8E0480694951B08CBB30E7BC69D49DBA
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0xB075B09166B0BEBE4D662E240135BF55
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x1CDE739597DE27FD8BB75F9835D5EF60
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x88154179FD63946215EAD8ED18FF1D5C
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x53A0090CA4A5987255EAC3EEA3162A55
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0xCC8843379FE3505883A63954421B660F
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x598D0670E912D973E6F581FC5A15C168
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0x675D0F377FB0C0FA549B59FE622CF3FE
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xA18CE5DE60AC86B5FADC56BF9013C52C
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x2570678A7623D306898160BDDC7A0AF3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x978C21A3BB86F94CE52C85BD8304E93E
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x97C094D1A3C9ADEDA824D4F4651BB720
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x24F0D6CEA0FF0C04D15F8DC062C7BBBA
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0x6E591849433084D218DAE495AB3BCAE5
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x86C08A83229A054F07B12F0E10738F49

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0xE1A49B5B69511416505ED97A04016E6F
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x7BF7647F994E6DA087B2FE23F110A877
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x4BDC0C8506659EFBF8186DE2106A6B10
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x286C52C5DC053BDC062FED754A960B96
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0xF3AC042AB0121CF2DD7D907C7969FB30
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0x43B3F8165B22C00464E0A986EEB27A13
cheerful--
0xB529EA137F457466E73989835D787711

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0xE82160984FF1B611473BD39927E3F6F0
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0x7233B8591099B4BFF3E3A26189F3AFC4
propose to myself?"
0xDE4AE96F8D8EBA209E0A9230FCA7FC39

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x6350928808129ECABAC7DBA64C37FED9
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xD7F0D424458AABCCBB1120E315390645

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0xBCBC6DB638A8A91E218D1CDE4F2766D6
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0x9475C50DF5B234F5F6539AD5585E374B
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0x6FCD46E368FC4037466A608DB3A2D56D
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0x48F760D171C26F5F107A0EF599739281
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x86E00B086C5A42DF209DAAAAF65148A9
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0xF5D38B245D92580FCDB02C3274104D25
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x22E7C1D6E8B23034D63A400C6EEA9042
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0x947E1559FA37E07499051C80FC21F9B8
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0xACB65AAAB7701C5893B02146002677F7
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x381A30906ED4737E3797E225B4C5BA9B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xA5E299953980B3B13006179C6C3E7DC9
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x275B0D67E0458A4B53BA5A9E71E6436E
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0xD7D8F8B4E0110111A00906C355FAE19A
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x806CA42FAF8602021E9BF77369BAD6F2
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0x628CD56777C2D74A85147E679D4F3D5D
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0xCDF250C0C3D05D1D1C05F1A8F375293F
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x97CADC36EA6A276671C773AC195BA9FB
delights they could yield.
0xDD1D87D22ED65D237A22A1823356E34D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x3F7B817F39D392EA63C02F62C9443E49
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x6AF61C8E974ECE5EB2BE27CAC0FCAD59
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xCE2B8131FF916B6A687B4A174F0BB4A6
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0xF01F7B522D474D932E74D3A63F40317D
produced on me.
0x08CDEAC714A73E8E286B898F24E17DFB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x545F7E6E7D9137FEDF5BBFE67799F76C
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0xEDFB50751E45E7E57722C30496A69A16
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0xA38A27E7BB38E8079AE8EA2E31BC2805
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x7A2B218B520238F7826421C57ED353F3
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x22AC8EA15357E4E7AE68B837F88D4E30
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x4AA7A61EA6C32135DDAF9E681E87FFDC
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0x290B6171589E082822DD5B3B50280CC8
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x865A1381301B38037415B471534CA533
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xB24C01791B7FBAF70DF5DC79A228F8D3
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0xA7D148A894C96740FAAF08F762FDF08C
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0x2BD7E64B28F3B24190C6F0571C848E0B
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0x74F1A80D3A022C484A1DABFAB0FFACA1
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x3473162418EF9245A62D7E92DA219F42
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x750FD9103B059D33E029DED813C11EC1
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0x5578D9F8F98B6CA3312382B291FD6890
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x0572C3F14AE119E4DBDF3D0B015C3785
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0xF80A0FC71EF12CFC0666CA7464D364CA
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0x6C8B2AF182563857DF2E266A19BD3BA7
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xDF0190FF0C691D637B2C8898980BD01A
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0x78054506863A0423CD1DB237BDB6E69F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x61DE7F03C46BA9F8D04F878527B9CBCF
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x91D77C1DB4ADAD9AEA005F638144CC7A
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0x7D503055A875CBC49090AEEB76EA86E4
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0x8938037693907E259A16D6443656F6AB
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0xF1444ED88B24A796BC96AFC34BAAFCCE
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x85F1E271260912CCEB481AAE4747EC0E
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x70A6D37773259C1223DB0D3BF6BFF500
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x4287B6ACCD0FB7417B797D5C3C61EA41
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0xA344B9604969AA7E9D01604C207B429D
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0x1AEA95E495D67008EAAFAEDDF6AB1790
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x0F11C77970493110C5A3D23358BFF310
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0xF0DC6AB83FD4E4A5BB3100707663532B
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0xC5AD2F1679A76CAE3867833A2A947D7F
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0x616470BAD12E1E6BE5CEE688BA688C5F
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x2D8A89494566A5D49BDBB5C7EEDD20DD
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0x932C441132DA520B5C593E327246E015

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x35C423060BF680FD1F64CA87E52355F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x6BE265323A95E4B291BE0186813970ED
myself to undertake?"
0xC512F74873E97308BC0D3EED6F5C7AD3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x6064285491A75E1D07A2A6B2B30D09CD
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x2AF4544AC4F7EE206931D03E7E711059
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0x80FB4056EBF36619FDA6755CEFCAE58A
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x4277AA6FA7C091E9E6C2BA8A5FE68ADA
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0xC6B726C51E3D6270F8B855E3EDC57ABE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0x21F59A4686E544FD55C7408341AE39CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0xFFE10A6CDB52BD9C222D6483762D8BD5
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0xD7A5007CC56B6D62BB123238BCDF066E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x0F5D60440F573DDB47C2CBE190119307
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0xD41C7B74D55C0491C743A8FD3FC8AF44
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0xA63390654485780A5D2DD44F6BBC29D5
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xCC18D4DA3CACC397725212D9A150A5A8
interest to me.
0x885F47213840A74D7364096D7282EE5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0x812C01152E39945747B677CA41F1FFBF
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x2A74797E3C0130A658719898EFF3454F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0xFE6B130A8492D16DDB5EBC100E9C1FC4
you to accept."
0xB9268127A016BBBFF5BB76FD30E15505

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0xAB524ABAEBAFBDB3EA8F872AB4D2965E
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0x5FCDE205D85E7E184A42583FCFB7B20C
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0xA1C379BFDB50BE603B91278C18FDB5ED
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x1F283865C3F0A51D45DFD516C4875A85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0xAA70E22C6A14B3B661FB3094A4442B17
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0x8A449213E3961A6CC746F638CFFABAA6
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0x666A58DAC091E147A82F7EE8CC60F80A
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0x5C3682D532871998A789086EC47354AC
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0xBA3E1CD38B0B4E579D902D1325DBD1C5
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0x294F515E293D53E33132653DEAD5B086
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0x940B5303034F7CFB76D16A9963EF4646
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0x24DB5E097CF4363268252CA0AAA57D3E
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0x2D1D234D4A39C44B607786DD8802FF96
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0xAEE3F9EE3C6ED710D8AC7BEF5DF74D4F
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0xAC14B0B0452D5DF18C44D0178705AFC6
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x171510BC87E9793148951D716AD0D427
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x45C25B5EEE73F771DE330375AB4D0768
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0x1790AE6682EDEE7004D97A5AF3C0088D
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0xA45AD560123B94B3605EEDA5D1ABF276

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x84C829F66530A8ABA45960A35F72432F
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0x8C9A8D8D1CE76AAD354D974F3847EB35
glance.  He resumed--
0xCA5A812CF7F1C162A4125084B41A58EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x2F0A1566B93BBC7F63D25E065AB9A1E8
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x50482DD607A9E10E9C9B2C4DF479CBFF
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x86F2F704007B4EDB35174A9E70646950
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0xF4ABFC044AAF104965B8373D4956E08E
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0xC5E65CD0472FB3139BB071CDB3D89EE4
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x0B480EE2A1B078C0497C0AAFF23D79BE
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0xD7288990F49E14C592150EDD425C98EE
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0xDF535EAB8EE53245DC1AC997434B81F3
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x2D39C64A73E5D56365593BC210E335C6
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xA2E96B3789D6EA9147F313FF9B0AB2B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x40CFF3343E1FB5A14B6C2A5D154C39C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x487BC882906548249F8582D4DCE2A96A
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x9BD9E3025C29FC84E91253E478D54548
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0x74E8992E0818BB01666E85487392AC13
succeeding observations.
0xA15C6235C0E72C1C0549F6D6CBA40495

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0x697B694826F9238E165654D1BD89963E
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0x10D007207492E47028BC27557D5DCE96
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xEA2FF94A012D52064356938149AA6A40
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0xD4CFD3F3E449511F9CD292EE6A4387EF
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0x962BB7DD2269AB9D738509700E9DC1F5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0x1D34E9502B8E9FCA0DE802CBB8B8980B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x4518B3BCDF37E358D3228445AC5E2E6E
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x314474DBAB1DDEE5A57490AE67D3B17C
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x7D8B250216724B0507188D59F79573DE
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xB2924D44EE4FD6ABF95C261EBA99B405
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x4C9FAF1B076D6955CF583BD9CC8BA65F
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0xEA8233C328D499D2E1B75E21B6C55FEA
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x7AFF4E069FB2685F95E3BA94350A4FB7
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x6A0DD1E6806FADE29D6B8529C87D47DC
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0xC96E093B77AF2727A040A0246353497F
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0x2B9A47DEFAD2FDBE4AE3C67860296393
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0x26C05DB33F19D256F91CB82FA55E874A
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0x9EF13526DC90283709536605EC62115B
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0xCB0D278E058249C4EED4EEFE9B2374A3
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0xD9F935FC6DEECA589127223936BB2F56
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0x96EECA53FA8CA62E8F5F395D93745C87
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x5AA4A38A5EC9020FA340BBEAAA99BA91
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x19D7C348DA3864365ABA998FCA22CBD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0xDDD561B0153B28AC994BB7E7415C355A
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xBA55B1608885157765C728B9F2263FBC
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0xC4E6D096DAA4551E9BE05C702DFFD5F9
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x8CB35325870CDCA32A16F6C95C1A6332
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xC522F485FB6BABA05B358C0DE2F43B70
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x7D3248F9007811196BC7DA973F8404FD
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x06A3ADCBDDDC15B407002EFB53F75811
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x213B0E980934FD4C093C6FD4883536D4
decision.
0x0D541E85AE7DFEF9F4CDEF8E3198B0D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
0x999800E7E00607D582393467CB310EA3
heart."
0xE581ACAAE581ACAA9C47FD786627DCAB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0x5FF8E2F21E7EEB06C28E5E0EE01B0CB4
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0xB8EAF1E51C34D90DB472886BBDC50410
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
0x35ED9EEC4CAE32BFE630194A4CFAD916
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0xD25D24ECDE385EE35E2444674BFD4C5B
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xBED798D273B681B5C6AD27F467E07C4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
0x080F2F208A770C9EA0DCED91E333B0C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You know what you undertake, then?"
0x483F7713EFBAC2362D18600130AC8BE3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do."
0x63772C0363772C030EFBAAB9E94EA6DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0x738A990DF4D1F87EAABE0C601BE1000B
deeply gratified.
0xC42336313B4847111DCD613B604C104F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
0xDA47B9CB5948AC25AD38B40AF72A4139

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
0x45ED4EB61527238512E22F6729188C1C
week."
0xE090CDB2E090CDB29E0E826089DE59D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very well: so be it."
0xACFD8206C2694FAE2DE4520203A498BC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x7ACABCE0BD2903ADF2D603A8C2E2EC0F
me.  He shook his head.
0x201DD5C879E36C473AFF8059AB5448DD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0xC17E5E39DA8109DF26AAEE5A6B389BB7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x4FFFEFAAC42C1E1FF14AFB9FF6A6664C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0xC5CB3348E876C3534A3A196B70541A1E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0xEDF05A92D7974869728564E7C2FD6BF6
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0xD194D16241631C2526C5AEE9AF130ABC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am not ambitious."
0x97577D1C33F92C14D861D04FC88FE7F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0xDF99F4ECCD15BFF9AF7A564957B122D4
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x030E77892A2C5C583AD03E0D5B126F8B
it out?"
0x562128D419C9ABAB1459800CBA06EC73

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was speaking of myself."
0xA9B008D7B3FE4297BEA739FA86A4466C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0x611C756B9202AC9073C530BD969A9643

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What?"
0x7195B4097195B40945C7FEF67A08E249

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0x2A583A1948B04AC0DEF03D9FD3D80AF7
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0x7B9357EF2F30820BDB3275062010E803
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x3B0460669B59D2D78C2617844A9BF100
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x0DC9D324E634A5874E47818BD5AAF17A
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0xDBB6A91B34C16E6BB7CA74729196133C
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x6A012CE67E957E9CE1D0000CC5159853
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0xF2472DBCBA5738D9290B09E63DDE61E0
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x6CC4ED16CAF50CF133FFF0870C94ED58
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xA7B19D1E783C5A1CF81571FF6D8056DD
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0xD70C9CFB869F024D8CEF706CFDA91941
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0xB9F73DAA8DFD2B17D1836C811DD139E2
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0x711D7594AF8993B994DFA70142094CA4
some means."
0x244F15AFB314A1CAE688FD7B00956977

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x94D8F1B6D0BCB723E5E4C835DC76EE40
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0xDC8D86726E818CD863102195C54A548D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x4DFCA98316F5C489C59B134CDEA8A691
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0xFCE9F54DEBE09A69B66644DD9DAED9F5
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0x5CFA78CE5CCFE305A424E09B870B85EA
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x981AD0F7FF59FAC8CC3E1F356BE3477E
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x6E6CA681F6750C6859447635AA6EEE8D
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0xD0D7EC0459CC710E1E8825DD6ABACBD3
parting for life.
0xCDD4A5A44D3F5E92651853951DE3344A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0xC988AC0737B4CE61E7020AC91CA208A2
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0xA1B0EE594BD38DFC31F85823D2DAABA1
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0x0912A5A6B272BE1DD73BFBC499B9573E
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x6BFCB6C0218A24E8AB22A1F2F1959619
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x8D095D5CCC027280B0297CFDE2B09CF5
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x5248C9D61F8C2CB8BA50CB598B0E8B1F
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x12C8AAA9146483AFA1600CA5EE09AB56
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x9F3DF0D0332C7F27343D2CF67C62E728

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xE8F4AC24221CDA844101C5B12DD12EFF
she murmured.
0x02FE55FFFCCABF87424FD4CB417E6799

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x72BA7DC23F050492E3E5C2AE56E33D36
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come

singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0x2FBB9083473D6D1C90C02DFA0CD55793
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x40C5DF1D5DC9CCB5D4A9E4E12C9135BD
letter.  He entered.
0xE602D806D4820055480E1C5FBB827088

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0x12668DA22056F670346F1F0960880929

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0xB20E11F4E37F1EA661F7261D604AE3BA
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0xAE57A11526D902500E6281846FBF06ED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x9DE57D5609C037C425783E791E7A953A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xE59DF65B3FBF3F25812A63D23B225A3A
demanded, in a low voice.
0xA2850081CA644D4BEFFF7211502BCEBE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x8F86384CDF4A8AEF15A9E7A565F3E519
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x7ABFCA85407DD17DEE67ABDF89216F87

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x1B383406B3B2AE42502B01B71B7511E5
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xCB3D253AEF424027517C24DE3C3C8B9A
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x80551FB709E6062AE3049459DD817513
enough.
0xD557E232D557E232996C6F33DFC4756A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x0273B7AF38F899F5ED74FB64C6514815

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0xE2C3624803295918549F7D54DCC5A63F
Mary.
0xDC7C597ADC7C597AC469980210E89CBB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0xCAAC816B9DEA15BC09FBDEA84C05739C
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x484E05220F57BB1860E0FCDC85D32B05
what _is_."
0x1EAAD9E8330C45EF7C78356A3D58EAE0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x3269A54F33372D787965919C3244D3AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0xC48E66A4FA5325CB7455AFB1454C2C45

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x7472B6E90139C26B5DC3E73A529E04F2
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0x4A85DFB8CD7CF1C90442EB2CC25478F7
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0x04848366BA0E23A9C3817B19A32C28D0
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x4C5658D28E18959BEA2341F30C184739
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x9B863BAF69C3B3E5B67A770A52A43CA5
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0x624C9821A2ADB6D09D6E427BA7C2C7BC
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0xDD427F1C5FEFDE3636E40E304FF103FC
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0x1CF01BC265B768EE13BB435238349E9D
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0x423976381E7571EF7CBDDEF8E8F010C8
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x49EA45A37FBF1F7142CA690CEDE010A0
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0xF72F161C2E060EAE9E60CFCCB8D80004
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0x9FAD48167342210A770036ADAC0EBE2F
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0xBAA5E7FB8B1562CF25FD0C1DD88D05C9
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x8694FCE49F530F574AB0B0F459926CA4
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0xF86E3ACCBEBDD5D46A98173A67CD3CE6
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0xC9B9EFC51B8C5F44A2DD80DF6480FBB8
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0xA5CA2FA0CDAC6693619366091AD0CE44
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0x1A6E6A17E4B441621EE453388C500E03
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0x1525F7A54169CFD7521CCB19A3FF7A0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0xD4EB06C718C5211B39E4585A2A7D4823
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0x915D6FAD376E24CA42299533DC701233
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xD0E53ACCAC6BF7AAC1299B3EAC652FAA
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0x7DE65C37595B8E47B8C12FBF35EB7C52
and so the old grange was abandoned.

CHAPTER XXXI
0x30E73DFBD52655B995AA3A6EE806BAA3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x0FF5304C6CBBD5BBB6D1ECBA230CDAD6
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0x633E32E6A7224F7A3F932ACA50B1CDF5
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x77D78558DA04A3770ECAC335F33708F3
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0x82B7E29A3950448CB3F35B1BD978744E
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0x3B5FC14151F166EC79D2C1325CE4FFD8
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0x9247CE034531089B881E620259B6332C
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0x0A08A309C45FA2136EBDA622C7C7EDFA
things as are necessary.
0xB9CD8B6F5CD5D55BBA52C2341928F7F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0xC76F4B6E29875910AAE62287E8A9CBF2
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0xEE3885BE063503997B16E5103C5935AC
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0xCBF23E7F367D5647EB46A398670E5214
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0xD4D25C9064317D995DD78398B1D8C7CD
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x0C20BAC337A4C4642F0D21D6FAF8348F
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0xB48C0A9F0C2A1F808767595DDDC48333
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0x08CDB097DB0DF52D30D0E7D14D9B2CA8
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x85E972FD9393C342592477BC63563162
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xA763EC879F0C4C7B1164A12F62654FED
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x974767186D7CF831AD629BC30B619B29
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0x9F826C9AC4BA3FAE409EBFE3C45AFCEF
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0xD1C4987115719EFC36740D640666DE40
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0x69F5CF0EF723FE7D46EA8A1B1E4E6BFB
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0x5098FF9DEE5DDC7E83DDD681F5E28C4A
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0x24C283DE46351E65F8F8650184C0301F
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x75B76A465914EBB6D0D6113A79C2C796
on from day to day.
0xF7EE71B24D09C7949DD35998A6BC178E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0x8F0298B926C264CDF924B9B61263F919
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0xF38DFC09B432E9D8BE07E7B4E1E19602
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0xA3D123946F280333E63A1F51FC763674
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0xBC0B6D0EC3DF2995D498DB7CC82BC7D5
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0xE09F724E17FFC85B59CAA1417471B739
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0xA7C0EED8819AAFB71A1E40A41C72B59A
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0xDA23D81D23D0908731C89BC43C299A65
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0xFBAF4F053ACB5E2A1A02863813651CFB
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0x4D1309378EE612569E5B7CFF58664DE3
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x5590BE4D6BA590BB833ED120B87B895A
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0xC5910F61B12831C74F1177225BA53D22
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0x279DEC7DDD6FADFA6A24062E03BA1BAD
gratification for disgust.
0x993E01401CAC5165D9FF6F6679D2A399

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0xC19A53F59AACFD1154979833E5B57788
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0x950CDAC2F3A4632EE9CA2F08B3EEAE38
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x06607579766DB5C664C4020E4AE04AC5
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x1119FD93F8E1A19A0DCCFCB2A345B34A
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x701F2846EC88955FDEDB220D795D77C9
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0xA2E3FD964BCD77AED15EB03959EF1497
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0xE74190E9F2CAB64DAD122E4AA13BED8F
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x3BFA589812372AC3C550DEA8EC90FE56
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0x4FC14006B8F0F4AB2013E046492F3E77
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x71C9D6A82C78BB6662A36F1FD607AC61
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0xB9F0440EEFF7577D267BF392D5BBDF1B
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0xC56101F3059FF13102C79F56294E972B
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x5E41B5D55EC36ED0E2CC4E25B17190A9
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xFD2E663AA7A528AF8E55A2C8541F9FE7
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0xF5C6848DEB604F5984C27B71FDDC550A
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x002F5FFC3F6DD8D1D508D0DE67EB22E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x367913CB45A81557D60D9B7DD1777B99
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x476D8CF38EFE354C1C537F9C8EFE77E7
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0x48438087EED3513575506ED786906693

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0xF2D9F7EEA7C467E8921F289B093AB6F9
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0x1ADD5813EA004E9AC29002BDAE546737
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0x8DCF4BA998DA4C53B91A50E15EE0D559
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0x2DE372A05EEC4461D686524560F25FA0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x2086B2345729083A92AD35A078A8A401

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0xFBF844BAA70BBC1AF225C3675A568443
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x25A8C831E8B964C33E10B0AB201FB58D
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xC5AF3CD1D65F64BDE24504600D1831A6
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0x041430EB5712D8D95794EDC92764E04D
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0x3E2F0881ECC4586CF4174798319CB7C3
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0xFFA03EF7D6BBEE98A072E0548918EBB3
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x3692455688ECD3CB9A2933B1B6363949
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0x59182A167230BA84C76B30F6F7997581
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x6765505317F652868DF0B36B5C566001
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x55CA259C6615C0D2EA8BF9A9AC8F5521
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x0F67D6775FA9C347C25A056B1ECC7FEA
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x12F318B45456D5CECB632F7F72EDD51E
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0x571098171E71EBFC53957E0C93DF7283
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0xD793542FF40205B6DC8F99ED295375F5
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0x4F869EDE56F2C184379667C6A87909B3
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0x1ED37FCB4D8CAA48C7288DFD97144C17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0x8C808E9484FA04DB4772F4DD605BF994
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xAB4AAB6891F3EC0CFDE9B4C85BABAE71

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x62C1CD105A54DF4D7706C9B0EDC5D791
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x8D6A2BE6A9EF1744F9FCD4AE193346B0
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x60BDAB982AB6FDBF644AD0C69F9951C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x7E396F551C5436DAFD9F0E121827A0DB
asked.
0xD2AECF70D2AECF704CC40C34846C4034

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xECC4590764AED0DC020453C4538321AA
scholars very well."
0x3AA67D0E0731059433C2346DD5E31FAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x2BC10997DC1F04587353967ED4D6EBC6
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0xC5CEFA9325F27E835914253EFBCB42EE
I interrupted--
0x39A60FE282C3962835A109614022CCCB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x98E3C671ED03112264D74A45BA34AC50
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x2857B6D3321AEADDEDDBA8C16349077B
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a

was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0x67DC35FC823D41B6F73A485109FD4961
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0x5902ACB8A313FD8449D6915F5B1A0D47
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."

"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0xBA550E690FEE91BFC81FE0957591D99B
is dark and empty."
0x7FD167F39279D4BC7716FF66DDD5A7A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x47000D94DFFC92B2EA031B2851DBB93A
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."

"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your

good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x3A325EBB4EAA85FC3A6FF33F120D9FE6
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0xDC89CD68860C924A65C0C4EB26C244E4
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0xD87FF3DEBBBDDCB367A64DF5EAC1FBED
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0x831C8A07C227969D2E0DB7A3738E7BCC
steadily, for some months at least."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0xFC61ED6563BA1F7CDED71944AD674CC8
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0x9FF1451A15155EAB8DD2513A99C57E6D
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x2E76CC3E677F651696BD0EEB5946650A
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xC091B8B81C7F04A4D30F32CB9B82B4A4
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0x7F5A2D11E7EF9236F65E12139412C289
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0x18AA1F002956A220407A57DE09DFB103
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0xB372DA587CFA489909982A2DEDFB05DB
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0x339CFE9809080D903198D92258118B92
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x8C2DAFAD87E0FB4ECFAC93048CB2F35C
rougher than it.
0x142FB629E21A9714A7218053C2BF61B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x0A47C9CBCAD225C96F626822F365C2CD
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0x87889F2B1381C5C4D37D90E642B8983F
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0x960D4C2E54E94812135D9A0AB8D3A493
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0xBA4E1ECE5219FA0E94F46DB66E670BA4
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0x8428AACAB5E9AFC20F23DADEFEB6F9B7
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x6F91EE1BB925A793DEC47B654CA637BD
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0xE174E11DDA3110CD14D0911DE6377A8D
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0x754D0F06D5DFE19461E26EBCC98A9D56
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x8E8AF7D03CA18A5639695BCB2A23B3D7
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0xA630F4E14EE26CB350AF5C82405C01F9
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0x2BD145D3A0E86AF0195EE110DD2864B0
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x7B0D2737A459C1FD56714E2F5670F576
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x83B094EB5B7E141C35A6C8053544B256
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x1F39CEA06416D78A43FACA366B4A0A60
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0xE747752C0FF1299C423BD90073B5E4D3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x51914384E7331B4605F25C4DACCAAF12
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x19E7D2ACA168E6DD02B043BA58FFE29A
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0x9506A975D1209826566555651F3F5981
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x773C41C88E310DC8240218C91E4CF035
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x9FF6871A5409DDA26B0E84BDD148B669
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x6FA5BB9FD525E79A8BA000F43F8796D5
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0xC35E74ABB55F0B7B2D5060BC5352C688
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0xC4FE530E118FE9E738E1A9855DC1BEE0
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0xD9929725AE15E90C1D50525B3EC78470

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0xB7CB6542005DFD672978216575C4B726
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x53BEB78970CBB4023B809A412669B6F4
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x7BE04CFB335AEE3E6A93C3176CC6D914
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x4BAC9678B4CCB8DA7E8B2E6F7ED32597
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0xC003AEBFF2544B9D65D12A69FCD9414B
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0xF3F2F3E2EE6A3AC056D6D6C64A4B1445
exclaimed--
0x82A912331CF2E194BC4919CE8430C762

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x395883EC099B596B17CD9BA5586B0932
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x66D2C1230CF0A2C34114E61FC1CFDD26
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0x2B10B9E04BA35CA181AF44D70A27473D
your back towards me now."
0x5CDA227D96D309BDFB7C0E49C5E6ADA5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x39EF1A714931A81D9246BDFD970F21A8
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0x6D8485CE21C36AE9C2710E7C7A454C21
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x3E7F17BF653517D1A9D5794757DA893F
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0xC878940B37D49F7B1548B9C519004BCA
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0xA76B04473B61143418FEB83B03335A44
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0x657A97E05CB0EBEEA93DFEC6387B5192
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0xF926372BEB6B36B95924809A17949FCA
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0xAA34EAAF929AD7CFB7E47DB5C595094B
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0xA944E7DCF001016296C013799923B142
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0xF74788F1BA6BBDDED0F0C48C89CE4AC5
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0x68C02BC9D4E3ACF17B95D72DD656A809
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0x58B4A8B6C80812BA9065193B0036A4B2
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0x2A149421683C6F5057DA003196904D25
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0xA144E1A719A1FFE38C2B68E1723EF681
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0xC11C285B0A1A0BC27EBE7D06F33FB455
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0xA1E1F352F854467FC25DCA61874B9494
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x1B69890FBD552E56BDE80A58D939737A
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0xCD464CE6D00DF1D6CD39726D03A5A76C
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x0E0FC9FD1D6829742AF6E367FE158CE3
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x9204D495745DD03CB2DBB9E1DC48F0ED
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0x69CBC72CE4E5D7EEB5563185A56D9FFC
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x61E9174771B4BFF967FDC8FE1BB06447
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x731ECCAB95761F68C0FCF4CAC517FDE7
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x3F6CB4232BF1E2BD3EB8937210CDD94E
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x2778BC660DFC9A660B2470073B2C0593
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x01628613D8F5EABDA6F63B9D6A4A83B4
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xBED800D055C55C54DAF7C7ABFA74551C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x220366D06D6FE293DD8737171F8B3C5A
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0x61DE648452606F50014EB6DEA1FFAD10
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x567472FC2ACBC94CC8D9ACEA3D9FFD66
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0x7D3D92C8FFC833323AD53F0282EC73A1
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x7F2F3E9C1EEA320940FC2FDE3AB2A92F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x9A21CE5765A5BCC084521467070D297E
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x32C6847CFBCD66315554A0C29C7305CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0x58EA5FADF92842E59685066FCDE15062
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x6D8E24B7E7C0D4F23B37B1CB1190DB1F
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0xE6BFCE842F2B5EE6FFB681C549391C81
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x68B3DDB1AE680F1EF3B421DBBA2E26A6
pointing to me.
0x329007CD9B4A8EAB8D3AFB301178350F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is," said St. John.
0x83D59609A94A8A2ADF42B8EFD2688D0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0x6DA8F22AB817B5185110B8DC83F30B39
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x225FA697D598AD6E0A0CE71C4776E6C1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0xE128243BF611D1B45503271B091B0555

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0xFDE83B3F2F12D254523A850A64ED3ACF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Quite."
0x64ECED796D0C64D2C4EFFFB113273569

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you like your house?"
0xEFB2B59301BF3909431620D5BC31C3DE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very much."
0xE10D050E1562775ABACCDCDFA10885D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0xE5755B9D0E27904E5C2883DD0042EF07

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very nicely, indeed."
0x51C36F61E474BDA1CECA37010FBD51EA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0xCF8C8A472C5A3378354460BD11646989

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0xFBF5DAD2916FCFAA1154C18C8AA23282
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x2D60F51AACCC5ECBB49DD5913B8B9EC1
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0xFE436AA65684E44BDF1DCE2D8FE5DBAC
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0x63AD4C44347CCF01F0B8D0465C20DB00

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0xCB5866B40C130E015859295550236F7A
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0xD7A877ED31629054AF33D90CADFFE43E
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0xA5278CF19EB394E21AE70289A025C869
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0xCC59BE6BF349D9324AAB44D6683E57CC
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0xBD9F23B9AFA4A83CBC7E2C36A30ACCB6
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0xAFA792607258FC699D4B7EF6A7F1F144
merchants to shame."
0xEBCE2848B97C5688104A9307778AD10E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0xBAB9A0F95F2646A968D4DBA1E55B88C2
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0xC8688A22B4E66AED91B76EC9C6F61270
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xDBC8CF54847CB06C64413C6E72C8FF8B
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0x30A80270580C2F3C3DFAF37DA792CB6A
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0x009A24AFF6D21A6BDB9EED2002EF4321
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0x194B2B15FF3091A1A034C82C55265D03
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xF64290305083B5080922AF7D95EDA6F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0xAA3D190440C5D3300368065187023F57
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0x85F3C842E7329FF378AED5A08DCA4ECF
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0xE5F565EB32A934FD166739F6E2EFAE23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x2EAFA678B20FD626FE22FDB6F9071F38
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x4B8CFE6212AA4A0D1C0D1E8A750D4332
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0xC301F65B1D9D93E7CA2E205EE2748CA3
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x17A6044A57ACCDF78001BF63E646B0A8
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0xDC13DF83DCAAE8EE63FC71EE698E07DF
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0xDB95A6F1E0B7B52B26F5B9D2ADE64EB5
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0xF91054C9659438D0C9E3EA9A2573F3D9
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xDFE1FD0E7733895F9FFB92D95CD55E9D
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0xA4EE98E943FAD4EFC11F5370144C4D84

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x2BE851D2C6CBA50A9EA5855A8D911515
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x163322477B26B52A024090590ED47834
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x84C30EEC6FC123F226185B444E3A5F04

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x4EEB16A4A2E0DBEEC946916064443B63
John.
0xDC7F03F7DC7F03F7AB831824871651A5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0xDE30C5B77182FA96D2F521141EC7921E
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0xE7B713D5D0372C65B098811E992831D5
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0xA6590664098605424E0F023FE8C4DD4B
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0x3271F703D58B672623F454EC2BCA1B31
her own.
0xF4CA8C4855E7A555EB4ECAAC25DE9447

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xA23762D2732CB4F727DCF9D85262671F
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x5E88FC1C5D5655F5F9C876EB1F9AE6AC
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0xBC2CB18634E0AE210D4FB2D7117F33DE
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x571DC1F6100A1BDFD2B05730CF72693D
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x1F8CF1A2DC6C8FA4C0D2F013FD775D33
papa."
0x868C5490868C549055B749A928C04A6B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0xD16965A430B074CCA272EAFAE015D05D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0xF70FA5EF60B3D5308D0359DF49DD7139
it cost him thus to refuse.
0xBB50BDDED1D8F1F7F012878975E8D1E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0x4D8C4CEEF518AAC7466F0BD8FE09A043
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x395BFB429D56778D5F84703DB13AA00C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x60E909884BEABBEABB3C09DB931A0F71
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x2C4A0A1C200DEB15C66DAB2ECB5850B9
returned.
0x8D929232AC2B3A2CAFB0FA1935017394

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x4FC215A29542A7A54906E00B79192660
blanched as her gown.
0xD9032F5DC42A3C5942DAB7E40420495D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x10773141898A017946EC892D96ECF85B
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0xB5FD67E5558D499D690909DB555034C5
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0x269355C880AFE45046D9A92ECF36DA3A
at all.
0x743940C3743940C31AC6CCF95E84A4D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0xD67D07993AFCD3ABEDBA0A99EB37D8AD
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0xB0D80A9F4296C9AC5083D62F08085D91
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0xE8F4795E213D9748BCDDF5AE41530096

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0xD9A33C8FD2D0EF614D370FB4E6D06B30
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0xD64DFAC42C3CAFBCAAC7C110819D67A5
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0xAAA166DA00C7ACA423BD213AC634E7FC
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0xCDD5487CFD5EAE261183033639E4B907
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x71EA51E265C82FD3CFF2A094BECE7B2B
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0xEC5C6214F7D543C4CA289A181F6186C6
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xE560C70959D921FC2ECAAE7D232C15EA
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0xD779BE8C6456D05B4D91C074096404DC
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x63432DDCF90F4FE7C5A479AE5B06DE92
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x452C70FE040E852830591E422DF5AF51
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0x3CE81F773F42B967A8DB2BB41F18000F
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x5577E6D97A5CF4B7C49E82DB0C27142D
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0xF3323157D60D9E5DDEB3F195EFD152A2
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x5B0B832EC283EAFBB0779A35570FEC77
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0xED5AED5862EA490E4BA81EF1DFF64814
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0x2A52683371D610C3B763447548DFFE83
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x160773EAE2424866562E973BAA548C16
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0xA8B7ACBE1AED02F89D9478B399397358
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x8231C31FAB99529190CD2687E710BD0F
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0xDDFC688DF9FA1FD97A75FEE08118C5C9
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x121412F4FE129A02E8CCDDE5F1FCB164
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x3A9CAC6F5A6A7878272788A180B45266
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x6A5F8F363E66A1B923A9A5C81730D987
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0xACDFC7EEA296E183B62EDE56A7D21053
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0xFDED6FDEC0BC7EFFC7DA391C25DE790E
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0xBAF8357AB596BBB4753262E80AC5D93A
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0x38AC90A1E222B88D8BE7CB230233D19C
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0xC3824E7DAF0043732E79F0602A1F7470
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0x8003486984AB807B1B5C2C87585D9289
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0xC23587B8A5062B857C5EC6BB42B9C5C6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0x78BD2935F542E1FF574CE15FCE2DEB5C
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x1247D2FA31AE48078262608423020A3C
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0x17798A4424C1B21C5C62C530D7B6642F
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0xB69225F49CA9833AD212FEE794ED837E
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0xECF102FE5AC98280018CCCF31A66DBCD
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0x65DA9158B2FC2684C2E32F0D8E52FF14
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0x5D9D21504332B2AADEAF1D0F7A482041
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x6350F4DEE99027AC9BDB7FEF496322DB
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0x9B9CEB0D72D14811AF2AF346D72B6A7F
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x4171BA575E565624FE3F02D442027B65
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0x1F9C74484F31F118F999D6F74888738B
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x2290E1B4AE7444E9DF1A7F7F742F6898
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x4E07030FABC4F336226C115007B2B5AD
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0xB87BF64ADF4390270BA78C6E36F6ADDC
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0x3868274AE0C31D019811B0CD31EBF3A2
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x1CA943E66797595E816C446221FA1BC6
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0xCBB65B74336A2AB98349EB79E2636037
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0xB7AB35D96DFF6AFE1C1FB2BF76CA5C82
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x6CD82B038E05F5A005F45BEBF18A8337
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xA7A71F37D9531F9110838B6CD76406C3
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x77C14A09C7FADDE3BADE44F7CF0C92F2
duties of the day.
0x44604ABF1F4121D1D6C26A39EB1333EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xEEF076F1F4B7DDA6572ED4979F318344
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x0CD70E6B95AE5A9EEA9B9E9C4C2C52C0
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x5E13B604A64A3FBA32B5A932086DF07C
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0x8A897C3E88F4CD179E20E618FE95187A
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x8C5B805FEA34B426B9BAD1AAC7CF1F5E
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xE75917D034E242DC7A7CDD9DCB135EF1
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0x009085FB06BA04829A98898F4B100005
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x163ADC2E7F3D24B7ECE1C486CA6CBABC
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0x50846E9DD910DC07BD8971C297631BFA
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0xF31849C846677C159C732CB9683A4A85
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0xBDC6A0BE5EE98C421438C451B9D1B0F2
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0xE14EF9E4E55F24245C0EE69538860799
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0x91681982DEA866EEEDE9EE1FA098B060
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x3DEA1CBBEBCD4DF007697F38C1FBBAAA
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0x1EA3480B26F931C791A53CE35BF3D518
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x749F09B97503FE2CD311518F695534C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0x2D0D1C17B8569A1D35999B0361F430E1
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0xFEAAF490C482BE1199539EFB994B381E
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0xC0699BC456F17810B5EF9B9C64390FFA
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0x6746FF9AB24824113B1375EC721A4CBC
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0x109E3EAB852CB2E20B9BFEFAE468ED8C
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x123FEB4A5D6FB7696BECBE27893077A6
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0xC7EE0F30DD1762589941D859AB4077BD
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xD10C910BF9D2D6553B7B83FC21C993C7
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0x5E32F19B56381D0C5103365C2C753B78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x75D8E56C9B94D12325D3E24E989C6E0B
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xDBF07B14AF06FABFA782DA365CAF9DA5
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x4834A6DABEB127AEAB212DAF4834C6F8
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0x75BCDA98609661251AB099248F21700D
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0x1B603D1B246C5B701A8536AD1B472E92
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0x920C1C62B9B2E6B9349AE11A3828706D
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x9E960A2832252E7C12C05700A6EC05A7
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0x297C1BB555CA62B7343C2343BDC34057
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x1622590C40C0909ECB74716CA6610C46
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0xDDCBBF1971100478F87CFB564B2C1EC9
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0x49DA3E6803272ECF5E6B5BF7B13C72A0
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xA76324E4A4243BF2B4D1A0D1D08BFCDD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0xE8C7A7D95D6A17ED8A09024D3124EAA4
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x81C0D4A67E88DC3D97A9BC35A0AD6818
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0x5DF2E434EDD114CEE1B4B716398B1F0E
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0x48E91225E76EAE3C4C30235188172861
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x6BB294E0DE33E2479ECB38CE316C6460
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0x8FC617F85A052453F4C612FE5578CDA9
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0x9BE537B807A0870657E64913736DABE7
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0x8726EF7ABA2334E1D7CE08895F5B1DCF
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0xA6566AA9F73BEC6A6558A0150D167DCD
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x0D8F62171DD25CF6DB674CEDCB1F5C7E
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x86D66ED8B58876BD6CB23FAB6863D73D
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0x33D2F71C8279B980F0321C8BD39E2A75
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x9B169321D933A02EA75BD91B38627B9E
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x31EBB88AB459E7194E4D9D52F167F23A
acquaintance.
0x2B1ADF834CFECD34A95E8DD79AA3FF5B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0xDDD5B8A6693E6DC9A42917BA9517D2BB
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0xE8C858E944CAFB72B442C0A2A0EA4C5E
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0xDBDD85E1E7B8DB69FD616B9A02660B9B
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0xDEB43AA786A376F14A948FEC13D5AC56
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x198EC7B8E5067DCA265259D849F1FE35
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0x049BCDD2C2857080F0DC0B6444917303

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0x0F63379F7D3B6E8C18C176CFFC321A16
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x41A207D4BCDC515710E172DDECB0159A
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0xF848DCA82AD9022E48BD4417351287B6
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x4E978AA4368E31312D9A1C1CDB8706AE
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0x0829B360A456369F51E5DFB25CFA3ABD
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0xE7E17A0C8A906C73564902C4753A7C6D
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x8C2BC8E0C67F8A6117E6CA595D90F5C8
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x43AD8E6F01FECCA815A60DC9593D9EE2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0x61A18825233E4444B13B76005AD61F36
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0x15F440AE4556CBAF0C77051134261B5F
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0x9019BB8BCEE952CC88DA2E3B489E1F79

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x53017F12249A6E9285815452E6E7A110
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0xE65265AD9E87A0D542AE83AB8E99BA45
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0xCCD1A13598DEAB7EA63E2FE3481976F7
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0xA5593947722CDFADD92A985695E794D3
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0xDE2D3A64D90CC13183E21F4355C2BCAF
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0xE4CB11AC57196828D055A46F602C7794
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0x1E86E9E6B1D0370A59ABB6DD4FB3BD64
day.
0x667B07E7667B07E72237BB5D6358BEDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xE7DBEC064C04E26D20321FFBD75A1ED0
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0xC9ABB305AE44309F391579E1DE5B1E27
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0xF57C2D8CA4764FC46688C3F58B918AB7
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x28A45FFF16CE56B5A433896029412AD1
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0xD6604630740EAB3C4C181865D913D7BE
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x55A296D916C1D921CAB0B4D8660FBE50
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0xF577D588B47C57BAC858D6F7E9CCD02C
Hall.
0x8CF7F42C8CF7F42CC994A3C16CEB097F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xE55AD1CD6569FAF4FEA0C74D1BE5B343
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x69E1DEE1E2C70DC502C179F6AE99FD1A
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0x9AA92D926F37D167F32CABA6C678A65E
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0x7B9C1BE02860E0B48B3AD39AE76CF2F1
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0xB82C132D6C98499B25BDBF43174961BB
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x7BE8F6EDDCCCC9457CECC2BB5B058CFC
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x3AA4972CCB23FE6CA28B9912ACEB1420

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0xAD4482F75D88F48200C5D392BCFA0F94
high family, papa."
0x2EEB995090B2190985F1C243E9B675D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x090CC232F540F988C1F8E23F8819BB77
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xE963A3E3D5706796467E738B08DBED51
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0x42BC46FFAE877ABB87E14A6A63950390
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xB4B149AAC9A77C526990B55C14682991
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xCACE858F7A9184B141D440B7A7AFE100
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x8B99082E49CE09FCD777DC0989AC6301
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0xF6451DDB573F1DEE81FB5B25157FAFC2
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0x59ED0AA5DDF2D683C63DDC89B28E3685
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x66FC8F72A0A59B605C95C08B95326130
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x327E917C23C160ADE1D3ABA9E9893C24
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x36A8C6D7133CB39EC6F9F0053E1B32FA
compensation for the want of fortune.
0x4D7FB048838607882303E88BE68D0346

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xF64ED2F05E91E935A74A4759EDB1F495
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x3D179A160537BE2C725ABF320CC47581
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x83CE5A620AEFDBE4BF1557385295BC18
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x76B586ABB4A502004140B2BF92A8B82A
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0xCBA5CF88DAB711985CAA9E821F713618

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0x10723FE324197A3222B711241CFD8A0F
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0xE289F39D5A0399F51DC49BFEBFC5D8FE
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x929685F63C11BD54DDBE7702B2F5EF25
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0x04B3F0FE725DB2826D94A67F1364C6CB
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x15D7F57061EA43FD0A243BB6416B7425
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x021FE66BF7954E7898AA825D55122451
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0xF4B41C97662D8B26DC5E885DB3E2598C
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0xA7F043AB0A803E43D8A94E3F673BF72B
Rivers.
0xF8D478FBF8D478FBEE66C27081E365D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0xAEFD9057CC13BB1DC139050D94C4605E
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x198630CBD9FF5C0EFED3B6A7DA138489
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0x1C0F8A64D189BAA633DED62D1011C1A2
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0x823F505CA3935EF1A8F0691DD4142A5E
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0x8792D5F744C024BBAFBECC4E56FA9733
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0xC5DC901DBE97AC16AA0CF8B269528387
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0xAE7AD4AC92ADAC50DDB20657EA611002
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x06691771C905B966D38E1EAEAE87C648
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xC7747283F97B62249319F86F1253444D
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x278352807F5D783D5F4E87B251C32B1B
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x7EB7FD7B139C4C991FC47CF5B21EA7A9
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0xF3A87728B03B0745275CA60746258DF3
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0x8E9B2D1C4C4ABFBF9EA02C0D95584CE1
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0xAC146899E114539B212FE944C85D3813
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xC589FEF6EE11321801CC4B2890BC8782
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
0x062B825F788AE0993062F7163F85FC17

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0x3FD51366C91F596CBAE781720AFFC345
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x650AE1CA78A2AD950626EFD0CAC00E7D
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0x83F2D009D8F1B0D1483FAB3388ECA5D6
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0xAC2EC2A5313CE9A0AA9E04BE1BF09411
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0x88B089AD300D15C0750BE80E66C9DFA9
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0x4DA77E30A39A0BCFB690B61B9FF969A7
him some good, if I could.
0x2F739D81039D76E807368D705D9BCE7E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0x530651AF861401EFCA323BB277B415E5
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x16DE209B014EDAD56779EC424D24C3C3
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x52686847758F6355DA5C1F0BDD445911
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x853CD3F85FDB6CD19E8503F1131C47A6
him talk."
0xFFF727A1B8D0751B6E14B239E7B9B72B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x6262642F65F3B4AD522EFEA827B953A0
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0x15430415B6A13B22D535FD2A151E9375
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x8A9F9F179E753FFC61D9A284BB806692
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0xDEF193341A84779CEEDBD962AAA5FCAE
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x81228CB05122A8124F9A29CBECE9DB7A
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0x94FBFCC1AECB03E1F5721B4D1C79788D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x675A2164BABE8373836B4611CB1AFCBF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0x030528B3DC80909D30AE6D45A03B75FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0x47CBEE55D9C8090DA92C1D0C1DD7CEC5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0x85502CFD0BCDB920A54723682B12A6B9
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0x3AE9BDE6655E60B5603D14B5EEB8AD30
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0x096A33BDD5D4B472D2883061F7E28817
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0xD51ED22ACDFB57BEB0FC059508C6C8C9
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0x8D3D8D7EBFC95EB174BB03D5D437F1D8
rose and placed it in his hand.
0xB430A755645E31667E598D79DB00A393

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0xA613EB787A9706437CB20A41A572B011
graceful and correct drawing."
0x1CA6041D84ACD2AF1605863D729DB8D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x24C0A58990D2BB851CF7BD55CC10D903
like?"
0xF0945F0DF0945F0D6A8F05C6E929849C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xF52F22A76F13C1C0A7E16AA157C0511C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0x171015BFE31D64E5E461E67D2AA77254
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x9BFA02A4B9F36D6A91192DA6EBAE253B
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x3832452DE2C1D6CCB8FF055EF920A102
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x2C179240151DBEF92AC7D732B8EE1C37
deem worthless."
0x371D5F2DE79315F4764132586AB78427

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xFEF3D3FB5BE8DFBEA6AE4DF045C54F29
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0xF20321B4C382E7BC79C9E4ACA85C83B6
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x809518E0260B694DE8184D1643BAF8D1
smiles!"
0xDC801C31567925289D80CDF1D6457055

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x5DD62B3775FFA7BB1B4E35E40AC2591E
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0x11B3368BB5D5BB1F8E0BAA96D9D3F3C9
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0xD36BCE2A76CEB1C8BD4E3F7AE0457660
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x05CDBF62BCC7FD25F18D10C5671EB77C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0x8C974526B83CB102F066F3C2D59998E7
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0xCB363E6AF762950C82823E3FDB0A684B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0xA6706A98288D1162FAF8164A1BFCD516
or wise is another question."
0xCBC75F222E28ABDDFD2BE7E7E8D0E0B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0xE18A863D70056D572E386CD95516097B
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xDDC967934F2017D876EC0ECA9CACE0D3
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0xFF7EAEE3DC2E4F352896DEE0B8FF039F
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0xEDEFEAD5547036840178E647FE15E54B
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0x195769A0C209E7EDDA7E8C0E296CAE00
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x9D1E8AF56E551AD121CA30C5B93ABFFE
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0x681F55B201F28EA20BBEFD152424B872

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x2C17DE3C05D03215650940D1AF878C01
take to yourself the original at once."
0x9319D9F5838294980530AA47D45D4F1B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x243B9DF0C6A92593994BD1950ECD97E6
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x9F75BD51BC3FF0B5BD4ED0A1632EA140
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x1CA826226EE06320FCCE415ED891EDEF
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0xEB41164F32D2191D128DAD720CD38E5D
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0x48FFFCA2B6C4F0F1934435534DCD8B41
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0xDCA790823B614B2738D7DECB906190B8
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x945090AFE6DAD4934508CE852E56F2C1
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x41D0BE729C3CF0ACCF2642126DE76DDB
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0x2121438D5F1303EBFAE2D7E098832687
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x3361ED88D6F18CD7B5101E7B9423BA10

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0xEC189A861C301560D9616386FCDFC0C6
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0xCE312D0D7AB0D65DC0AB1ED5C102B683
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x19602B072D0A5C527740694C72D6234A
ought to marry her."
0x22A80155F4805E456F2D0E860726F2AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x0A202ED579526F285099E2E9D1075EFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x210B8AEDE9C1831574B92662C2A52796
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x6532814CE2EC0853D8E4CE3926583EAE
often."
0x9EEF3BE39EEF3BE3B9C35B14BEA73BDB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0xDAFAE0220FD365C256C1DFAA59396F6E
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon

"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0xD5BB5E0D5796D16404D37FCB6D4D79C5
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0xBB8254E243A200B0F664FBB028FBB042
fetter your heart?"
0xAF576F310D1BA455DBC554C04AAD7FEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0xE4C8AC5EF5293C58F1D63AA038292490
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x5B66DB39A4332E3422E096762AA4A2F0
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x40BB27C12C595D4D2750E31B27DEC58E
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0xB26BD25A9FE0C131CD2B27A52D537AA9
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x2FF17C222AC7E4622E401FFB9AEDF908
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0xE6074B56B130FC0D978895E8826DBB2D
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0xF18921E603110A35627A2DD4EB0C85F8
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x72F5FEDE169BBBC2573370CFDB35DC20
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0x5BB9DD14D886083559FEA9C2D10F7DBA
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x6DC7A7875CEC730761BBE7B85EC83072
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xEE819A312CF1B902BA6197488DE68307
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the

I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x932012D976B876A89C60D65BA0E75152
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0x4A437315BAEBA54BCD5B335A480B2C67
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x7FF0AB8E9E80C600CF5855FA1F280AF1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xA902E00783F5DBB5F2999A5A9C82A21B
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x66565FF3B4ACD529B269B41712BA7173
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0xDC3848F7D2BD216C90DB0E84BB5DFCF0
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0xDA622EE15462E29E1FFBA48CA627FD11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x540A5BF91381423A5AE9CE04BFD9703F
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x36846A715EE20F264CF77492EE704545
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0x279DC1CD91EA1B4358C4A3F9E6976F2B
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x81ADBED6AD0B76D6CCD359B0AF93FD61
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0xB695653ACFDACA70D0536FDF7ECE7DD5
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0x3876790A51D4263E206C337E497F403A
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x05C8F2ED65DBDB7017991DD06E5201CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0xB85C75AB155FE10BF7B4F74217CB262B
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x92E61F667CE953FF6F90C768498BBADE
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0x08C3F991F07F7957FA024B06D8F6FA92
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x31F14DE1C8F4EC52D2955937D521C8C4
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0xFD85E96B97117873AB79685A98833D91

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0xB851BC796C5135C65EEEA09DAA4DC735

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0xDB232D517603A76A6CBE1EA24976B4D9
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0xD9A2FAC18BAC789254B5E3B2F748DBAB
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0x7535D67538890C4450F80E9569883A25
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0x54C7F7DD7A6CD5732E01F0B00D00DAA4
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x4EBF34EBE9FA22E2F4B24B71554AC388
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0x55EED9B0B58D49FF7E578D4997E1C905
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xF21F1886EF479245FD6D05DDBF622016
live for."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0xB3A44E6B4E4AAC490AD29B88E2AA9AA0
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0x33076F6254892ECBA10AFE2BFBFEF0FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x49152D519106332490010C66275EFFFF
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x62E2F30123B38739D81AC8F309F57EFC
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0xA526F432F9AEA4FB29EC7B20F20919AA
should do."
0x265FBE3850EC9EA0004F7A31B861412B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xC90F4C8365AFCC070CC1FD32B5C43843
wasting away."
0xD41DD03B8D763DD5B4737E5F15653D6B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0x740368FD7C82EC00FEB9EDBA2AA83E13
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x2C05F9AF06A8A8BDEF1571CC9475362B
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0xB286CFDADC653D413C3AFD610BA4C3D2
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0x34A0039ABD99DC0A8A099DB0035D84CC
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0xFB0819422B62AD88B2A5439F45B1A0C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the

0xA5A156E5AA5D47E19040AF4AE7137F8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x4F1FA6B1328F724FBA0CBD22D9C1F566
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0xBAE3CAF384F44256A21EA4D7C2EC7A50
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0xC4C4D44D9BD7C3B0F6A690F2D2333F30
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xE3E2AD5F6FC7EAB679C244EAB8B83B8E
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0xB2A1F15A2A87FDB55ED9DD07BDE5BBE2
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0x7CCAC691E4807F704904D8230F9BF3B8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0x7E7A089C4C31293F0BC820113ACCD449
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xEE86D1F3AAB78FDF44F32A92E457DE4D
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0xE52280F113FB94E0B320C44095BE5973
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0xC5AB74B759D13CC520A60393D283E9A3
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0xFF398E38B4D956EBB36A2ED5A5582084
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0x4BA1F419A2569CBCF60677F72A62C652
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x3DF782DC4C0EDDD9E0334F59AE562B1F
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x11E0B02B4668E260D2BFD1A53BB89229
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0xA70324C91410D59FD3A9E1CD0EB1417C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I smiled incredulously.
0x0B767A88A2C6CFE3BF47728405ACEA53

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x60C85DEA516803084EBB3B83B743C08F
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x99024CF81F44699622AE03B81D160BA9
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0xA4A9086033A964BBA3EEDC6F90078E99
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0x31B8D7342D03A91B55A09C40F59D7EF9
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0xD583644299EB17A7A6AD68F673691164
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xE395DC42D4A4C517E92558F88A1E0EB1
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0xA0407B004D5BE2896D617FBB05CE09DC
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0x8F52F03D5F0344A95B75A8976385955F
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x41585A533C5BCA42CDB1A7CE35088C90
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x2ACD2149DBCF0B7AD37F799AA7F58F02
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0x1CEA20EF4D9E038504462747C401AD04
still suffer."
0x71D7EB503C20F39859F7B5E2F18395CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0x2DDAE41FCEC62527FAB881DA6B161F21

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x69318BD4F7BCA95E7FE97E11A8528F4F
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0x18730CC6F7DA664988411D41F4526DE4
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0x1E66D6A04C1932D9053752F4D68340E3
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0x2588FDCC28777ECACCD50A7E2030419B
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0xC163B04449BFE8257FADC4CA72778CDB
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x80265F3ABDC60102D13D181A563D86C9
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0x54EE2BE62175609076780106F6E58565
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xB4A3852749F9FD8BFD5E1BE9C280336F
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x7A5F3F3619AE0EE5CEA113BB86FF6595
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0x6C525F3BC2A6EC10B5992BA28D7759E8
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0xA6CD5DB2A783982F5E3C85A7D55A3C7B
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0x9BB1CAA7C264E49F661BE0CF9043D76C
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0xB84F4CB79795FE6989215C68BABDE8C2
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x397265729284300132DA41EB642C4313

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0xE40BB259235FAF7777A4E73E62B65625
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x4C702C6C81F539FD84506B346E2B976D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x754B4E3D5366E75B0AC9780510E30BC9
World, indeed!"
0xD28666A8E08917DEDCCE7E46DC76B164

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x9AC3C08ACAC31DB6D8F65FDD24949AD5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x294F2B866425A88AAD816E21537CDABA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x9173B257B19D0CA649FAA082F2B740F7
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0x1A992C5ABA69D0CAF0978CC84A2E1D91
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0x3283F5B16A91312371D26FA20BD3E836
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x2DEA199F8467E7B991D41069BEDDB0AA
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xDF7C3507B3522C0E61AACD7B70BEA177
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0x581373F1EA5DE82C677D71A3328E1044
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0x837FCB218D9CBBDB10E3EE082A0E9707
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0xABE4A808511DF69F4131DD45328F3D82
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x6CBCF43379296C4B45C631E3B8F79497

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0xF020C6628CB99434D00A119B9B5BFCA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x9612EFDF50C7C63274DAC5AF192564A7
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x41A0713B39049F1D577A308ED7A8E821
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x91FEC21FC44DF6F46D07EBC6E1A8AC07

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0xAEC680E4B73136D2A4810E55BFDA72E0
globe, however!"
0x42D02EA427B74E1D6D07C7DA2D053C23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x1CB469291CC8875F5B5A2FC5D64485BF
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0x9B1D59967843E09892191A59CEB902F8
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x917DA697C751F4511FADEBBC25BA1D1A
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0xFD1C37DD70AFF5F12D1EBBE26E8CBDF8
forgot it.

When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0xD3B6BD5DD976B7580FA109A3AF54BCED
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0xA34BF42EB4963EB9767DA95632ACF52A
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0x04C4ED0710296B6017F5456D2AA86B8C
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0xF43EAA6EEB7832B34D4E0B5FEB0C6162
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0x59D89DB23C2A82FA87198EBB70759D59
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0x67257B007E4C01D1B430E734B7646ACF
took down "Marmion," and beginning--

   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x7738EFB22C91A272DD7B467BA94EB9BA
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x3A7C810F6C0ABE17C1F6461FA249CBC6

   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0xB9271869737FBFF2FD7097F6B0CB84B1
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0xB837A0534EC645A507561760B6BF99F5
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x042AE95EFC6CDF1A10FC82750FBDEE0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x4F374E858B1181EAA77B05B6142C1CB7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x5AA891659AE1F5AB368AED2162186B5D
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xC4DAC72A469DC88953BEDD7A6147F26D
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xB4B49489737743060CA5D36CAA8E9374
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x5F5505D2FAF4DF02B10E7BDCB24A3420
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x31B1765D4634D2D2BD304617860286DB
vale that night.
0x6ADC5A510BC497C6D84093229F8C9399

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x282C188ADB7B17C02A877B6636AFDB38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x8F9610D08DAA01FB7A7DAB3F3A05A02C
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0xF7786A815F9A2ADC920BC695AC634527
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xBF37E17D530E12ADD6CB581F793E431C
boots.
0x0FA526600FA52660FF2A4FDDD4011641

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x742A102409CAFF5EDEA960FC0B1F4842
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x114AF143CA9AFD0409D8DCC58132D812
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0xBF354C59443F1F2BDF02A1F8B0493144
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0xED20470B954D05CADCA84F29B27F25CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x6FF710F538111C947841127D5DD605E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x2855451A8959A141E81BB53AA75585EE
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0x923AFF6BD2C2AC2DC899AC788B87D152
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0x8B193B3B46735BE00322E1512320B5A7
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0xF6BC2362702E04889FEF16E1CFCBBE9B
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x2D9DCA071B590593640822EBA1CB29E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0xA763FB537E7D672D9AC725F036CD6587
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x9B4160B9C2A0E34B9AA1D5A491CFB542
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x256B1EC5ECD9F260B4C7F6018FB025FC
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0x100533FE98A6287E7E60C50CA646A091
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0xF149F1F51205B0EAF1E4D72F97B813AC
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x972022B73EF29F8D27D503E50A9AB3AB
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0x8E2D7127603F9B1B8FDCD86D3407EA8F
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xB68DFF55B54D1CD4DA3DA1140A5C0733
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0x9C17F6E9FD3B8492E2F5A5C04953B772
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0xD0412F4BD246987A67F28CC43F8F8A50
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x3784D9AD7D01337C18282C7E82B05C28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x1066A55395C1EF9D727C7A23CF592A3D
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0xCC55F5A6174582A99EA2FE473F2CBB5C
health."
0x6FA4FF509892788E351AC5C7B47E547F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0xC477A7D5CC393EBDE75CB3960DCEFAEE
What do you see amiss in me?"
0xC67BA97DF15601BD7C58A84F0B85DC65

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xAFC45F8C9337B6F435E62DE113A61FDE
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0x9C551530649608EBA19563B5DA3B9F0C
silenced.
0xB0CD7FD906675365653BEE85E9F325D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0x6431980FA2531FE19BB9A8DE1D6A022C
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x9BDE0090F60237A7E4E3B937574EAC2F
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0x32D6D282D9AC6155563FFB342B3C94B7
was behind him.
0x124CFDA5DB06424856EF89FEE68224EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x5240ADDACD96BBC0C3A9B562EDDAA38D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x12B8E5CC43994A7168BE1460B5F6FB3A
alone now, and return to my book."
0x5992376DCF62326E1C5F9DBF521895FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0xE7536DFD867D9F4A96556A8CDF47438E
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0xEF45187A1B9F3238DED3D90CD337BED1
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0xEC65A709534205E9317BD3903745E003
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x2A4D72DC31CCB4B6FBD5CAC135563DA4
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x1BA7AF582D51D1EFF20A331484E1255B
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0x7F1FE0E3CB177C4B3FC1560D440B4A03
I would.
0xEBDA90A5BF40A598336E99B8D1834161

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
0xE58907645A64B83710D3B21FD21DAC9F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
0xFA8335D0B5FC7C4F54AF0D5D13792A11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
0xD3117E531D2F9F12019EA525B867ED1B
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
0x23C7FBE3928302489CE6FC42BD9843C0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
0xF97678070591643E66E581FBA992C056
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
0xFE851429D81624F76D5AD624003A84BE
and my scholars.
0x00970456DEE7FD837166F146FE20818C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
0x68D06FC95FDE076CA6CE76D11246455B
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
0x80EBD46DA87DA7C5E400AFC230D56F67
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
0x9D28737D50E33F75C40F0AC68420058F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Indeed!"
0x68A8EF9548EB45E6F42B9154E4B42F71

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
0x7E99EE62A3CD024BC7C2CE737D0B7DEE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Does he?"
0x010A47F0B4169857A9FE991E79D18112

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
0xD5F302A45C06E11BE7BAAE9B26FFE519

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I know."
0x09031E76B546B22071178BFB83180BBE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Was it your suggestion?"
0xB3C317BD1DBCCFDA3FF4D0C96246E70A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No."
0x6CCC769E6CCC769EC67D54ACAE082CF5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whose, then?"
0x962AF73D92BBDE34BDD68DE1C70FCD3F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"His daughter's, I think."
0x62B14102D326CB0D2565AB5A0250D001

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
0x2EEF9546D2CA3206533B44FAA800BCE5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
0x274BCE1966F84DABBBBFB10247F5822E
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
0x8CADEBB40EF7D755A5B26AC58D38FD02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
0x8E3A4E11728570BB1CFF71AC7F67699A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
0x85EE0CA7A4449BBF988125A7E2793B97

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
0x5B5F333A08E45DF28B1A231BEFA802D4
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
0x43DAC519D6FF2A15083208775E4B563C
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
0x802515A0949AE1C615AACE9F771C8FE6
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x29589F2B8A5B57FF0DCD8C7AA12E8250
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x340EE2882869CA72148F3A8298F92068
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0x3CDD598B0457DEEFF4906F3EEFD0C9CD
trite or novel, it is short.
0x8C858F0CA69D5ADA3926269550DB8484

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x119C28EA396A7D552C479081FFB2416C
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0x05AE051C7F4860DB02EEDBF920FA24C1
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0xB60B80175B1697038322265CD576E09B
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x6778717C25A25F28B39FE5173D1F3880
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0xD9DC6830C6BE30AB712947271802139E
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0xF22EAFF246498868A061A225A64391F8
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0x52827CE9444DBB9A8384E3F6F3113A25
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xD73BDD6943214CC01D7E3DAB0F377B40
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xC44C5090B2C298275CCBFA519268DC43
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x56904A185A353D454AC917C715A077FF
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0xCF7FD72EDCEE3FCED26D4EE10FDF7915
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0xC52C3AE88DC3C9E8D2A6B7F3CDA1479E
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xB38299FC69550DAA1C086158BE328325
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xE632BE81AF2761A0B28A6200A1CF6DA8
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0x76907DF3AE72A525EE2069A26E566776
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x3FE2D0CA3C1077BE20A9EF577872DB1B
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x3F11C3A93F8B52367A0CCFC4982AA320
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0xE9B4FA8BA999F595ACD34D035DF9E94D
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0x61C7936AEAE40DD4EE67C9F214EE6188
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0xB73EE36F2DEFF7BEB4A369F35B25A22B
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0x890D011801C3E4FA8549BA32CE2F5127
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x65BF672C4C8D54CBD39702F3FA6D92A3
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x8948C730C388F17422168A3C532C81FA
Rochester."
0x738CE02BDC5C5A26F41D5290C8661BA7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
0xB6B7A20EFD11C1BB46D4021F563F99D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xF6AF3389A60AC605F818438957C2550F
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x06A423C132F1C4E11573F57F6A2B21AD
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0x387BBB855FAE2769C7082D37F9839FB1
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x2DC38BFCD260699E616EFDFCD5F02C5B
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0xDD1AAF0DF50EEFC030BE8094B7C2667A
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0xCAD174EEF4B3640215113DC45CD3D3D6
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0xC355A707844A179B8416161FB7C3779E
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x67E4164CAB6A9D2FD1C84903E6AE8420
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x058418CCDE3111DFA7E69AE357D3DAD7
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0xD334CF34C2B15E39A94602FB009DE653
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x07D200771A824DE1CFB2A3BD614F3EEE
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0xEE139B9A737B5E7B7E752500DF0B09D3
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0xAE76A36B1E4DBC9FCFE9907F156972B1
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0xA3A773B7E1BB88A811DD0AD20937B749
odd tale?"
0x33AD237EFF058406DB35513A02F536F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
0x6ED6B9EC4BBB90F8AEF3589A41DE1338
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
0xA2B6A844DAA7F4AE39BF8B509DAD364C
doing?  Is he well?"
0xDA5D3AF1275051ECEE93E2032C3C7AA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
0x4C249869AFD3416FE0C5ED2F11E27611
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
0x936FE09846BE57AC642BB1D464D9F5C4
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
0xC21B280C4C8D8A73A6CEAD72DC123036
which requires her appearance."
0x3239DBA90669ECF83D700D8FFC15B8D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
0x6504A770734840BFFAEDFA449A1CFD37

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
0x35B1AD0B1997C6CE157731608125A959
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
0x783860E8B6099F6EC49B6F00CF86CC26

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0xA1DB3C7CDF4C1B8ACB96F7A958D74095
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0x9E3A415961C2ECA32340542B0D8C4BE8
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0x341C25E99790796792BCE5C50867EC35
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0xBFAAA75834A30309A966331FCC0D304D
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0x5425B797790E7B93E94D29C28491A5AE
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0x4FF6ECA48812DADF5800C79EB2AAA554

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
0x60A871B3684E5C62E9991C6BC034FF80

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with

warmth.
0x9709375A9709375A5AF17C981A58DBA5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x1144465805114AB1044BD39097BF480B
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0x58D83F2CFEEBABA2F5FC98D13114DBB1
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x4E23E005ECF2724CF059A170023E3EA5
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x3D487FD9094CE12EAE36739932A2B258
down, fairly committed to black and white."
0x46930E1D86589158A99C7B6FF6047755

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0xA3D343E5B5A288E80A6A844B0373FEA8
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0xEADFF9247E665FBA5CB0152E30C1C257
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x47A1AC0DA75E7B53BDD0E787A3F9A031
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x4E5BDD487CD7A390AB3EF16F54D55FAC
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0x4F3370D7BBC852E33BA3AA482CF44848
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0xDBEF153D6653E458B714A3121B64A6D3
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
0xF0F0F7A00D47E4089C586358551C0058

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements

demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0x2429CC11B03A361876291FC6BD5631A8
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0xAE35A41CA50515365FF605ED6AB06A0A
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
0x1B2C24885D41BBB6046387AF242A657B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
0x05D1A36D069915459919F21D5ED9FEB1
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x26BD9E5C1AFCAC25F9A69A1972B23206
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
0xDB7A5F3B3AD5A5B3FD00A519332D6418
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
0x22B8861C0AD0EDC9EF018D9FF65E0427

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, what did he want?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that

he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
0x0173727680622FBAA9BA5154E769676F
that--nothing more."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
0x1F6A3683895D938D928ECEC615F6F773

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Silence succeeded.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
0x09276FF98957B6F5624DBE83DA8F6020
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
0x5DA35D7F4E9CED878CCA534AF6BA3EC8
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
0x0839D1B5B8169695165AB7E99EBDFED5
will and the necessary documents."
0xCFE835A07D74943473353062C9EF3EB8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
0x71DC912B5BA1FE7238362BC25A977A8C
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0x23894E57EC0CCFD68C2D1896CFA61147
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0x6099E523268B063AA5524157508E1443
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0xEE102F7E79D10E8B1ADFCD8360F61D3F
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0xF7033B08D04D9011C038A95FFE05712A
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
0x73331F580EDCBBDD7B694745651BEC06
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0xD4F8B650ABD60474E072AA399346977E
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0xAACED98C608CDF2CBE3E9C93505655C3
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0x7C020A6EB9B69B2B0F177A74C5F22C5D
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0xB05CC99EE012680AD5EF60842A0997E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x4183DE94E3B4CC5B41F398E36CE1176C
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xB5B20CE8CC4F6F27A2C4C86F0A4D040B
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0x4E9CB033E4A0A90E5DEBF3B803859C96
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x46C14321C9FC21E8B352DBAAA0D38996
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0x24AF70D9E23D841CC625B634D0A0BA2D
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x568364840DCBFE296D7530D72512DB5E
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x64DC2075D8B5891159D9B026BA42A42B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xAF8E83FFA7498BA66D0B81694D610E6E
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x73D2A89FD163A2958219EA76716A5D0F
will ask how much you are worth?"
0xCFE768549741173BCB1E5082A491AF8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How much am I worth?"
0x0771991EA720AC756E48F5A9AC4CBCD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x4F111A6F3B057A8E2A15EDDD2B62B7AD
think they say--but what is that?"
0x8A2F6907CD1026BE18D6FA13563919EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0xEC37C2704EFCA63796552264A02FC631

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0xF07D020E0386432A367380C62E6E0B06
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0xBC1D0B7CE8E4FF7552C5135B4E6C3321
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x4AB203C58929B121EC69A68E1D1EF057

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x441E526E4D907D8BA8EA672F343D9EB2
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0x9E73E2077EBC86ABBE25230E181F032E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xF817CCA8D7077BFA3189269878ED67A4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No mistake at all."
0xC52A5841A82051E8716CF167DDB91C8E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0x8938877FD4BAEA2BA54B358158A38F1E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x542FC093ECA6DBA4C5544E543BEB9F0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x859C20825B954CCD88E350D0DBDBC7B6
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x74CF48EB9F4A02308A023A2A1CD15433
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x5B1787C5CA86BE1829DB1613868ADF2B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x60973A108B383D750DF0592F875B1030
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0xB50107110C2209C0C5876CA5F33951ED
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0xCB10B6BEAE0A0AC67944CB20D58B804A
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x9341EF75CC8DE98EBF888FA88ADA7F43
Good-night."
0xEB697C6837D342A3A15E57798AB8C5CF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x0F7D2FB816FD6B7DD03A15508DC80DD0
minute!" I cried.
0x05C8586AAAC609247DACAEC3BDE00555

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well?"
0xBF65D68ABF65D68A3333903C58ABDCD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x855ACF872E77E70D0C191EA157AF0E73
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0x57D006F52491E147C22079A41DE8321F
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0x6DDCF75B575E20DB73F7591C8F56B4A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xC9620E3F25AA4342762DAC2784106C5B
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xF711D80D57E6C09A1D8AF02E0396EAD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x0DE5164A5FFAAE1E7D705601D51AA716
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x4A6C143E01CDE212C7D0F227F1D4E02A
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0x26732C0589142F074732C27D25C763D5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x62F6707BBF3422CFF8089328CB4EB682
about it."
0x21A3D1B6727F3AD46184A8920E52C3FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Another time."
0x697CB099447B4A2C7CCB59ADF58B5E86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x42BEBE6001F2A6E2D46973A65ACDFCD6
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0xD03DD2CEE2D7D2E2E5F305F7A6D4DE8C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0x3CC335D686D8940D9412693E5194F1EC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would rather not just now."
0x1D8DBE5155A495344214629DAC0B5EAE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You shall!--you must!"
0x01CEA27898C7EBDA0F1BD2815C0984BE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
0x49FCAD394E312D0484170B12BCEF89B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0xFD2F8D96689E063E36B7D9B2E1A0B53F
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x81D3BBF9C231A5C64C4A13A04A614CD0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0x874E34AAFF9410FCD902DE4EC05C2D42
persuade."
0xA6E664A690A26A6154B3B8FD72B0CDC2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x488421CE2DDFBF7FA60AF83DAAE07834

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0xEAEEFB5BCE4BD984B7FDE66A956F88C7
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0x47EC9BD6D55AE3CD3C56A35AFABABB49
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x1BD46830E8DFC0D936A4AAB5AC9F9143
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a

0xB7EDC5E572C8AAC1C84F745BFA331EA4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0xD0C78DA856E202339BDC8EEDFB38F26D
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x2B551ADB13E64A20E9CA168DEC6765E5
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x351FDCC9BE5D12F51A493F1608B9D5B7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x58BD77FD141CCB5242799495AC4AAB08

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was

christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0xA2D965ABC76221670C55F2CE7A101C77

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xB41E9DC7A2E7945F5573178BFE998BA6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0xD9B290EED958E521AC82496F917673EA
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xE53B932B5BF096C9060AB7941AC283F1
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x51351E010CFFC6AA0CA3C830169F2707
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x6995B20B783729457E3CD009C74D0947
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0x3246452658BFE28A1CB045E52B187E81
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the

matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x0B53D2CEDA280165D8B67F83D2A5E35E
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0xE81823132E24B8C8CE185C20EB36B112
explanation.

"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x408768CAFA3502D935583999FEB7D262
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0xEE1EBEDB218D27469791512F44B9F04E
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x5B15278BE35F31EDCC74C32A5DD64A39
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x82381FA75638CFCB70590923C72BD8FF
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0x96DF609A8D659C0B3E59810C69959F1E
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x0EE7971F65D72336458035AD460CA018
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0xB9A21076C273CE349A16DBF70EE88E49
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x7B5FF05F716E3681EF134DD35B6D6BFB
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0x27F6ECF2A3CA83DA5DC1D13560C32107
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0xB90C2EF268E2A92064A2308715D285A7
against the door.
0xD3EB3156F1B4B76F610B67B94B68FBFB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xA448B6526F28636F967B0903326548E6
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x7986E6D0C04834774679C97C8B86206D
enough.  I resumed--
0x305CD5C1D3021C630775CB42E3508213

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x4366EA65AC10E78E919B71055D9A854B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My aunt, consequently?"
0x63CCB16672AF19532CBED461035FB81A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He bowed.
0x1E49FE9AFB547F387AE6A4023E331B78

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0xA32B0B5DD06245A19ADB69D1000C69EC
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x07A047EC123E7B5003B9F48678734F62

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0xB7F70C5524B3318DD247A95100CF5C60
the same source?"
0x6558CE10F3DA4F0FC8F6FE29C3F39AAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We are cousins; yes."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0xAF2F10C1AA5D0B6721EAD03774ADDBDB
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xE9BDA1674B661CFE761EADC51E5295C0
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0x86215752239F7AF1114835A8841E0128
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xEB12A1D154398E5E9C2F6B6BD46CDF69
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x3B611E3444775A23B56A2B2C9D814ADE
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0xC9D6BB61CF43D537C714A211DD54F6D6
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xB74898C89310D8224D1DAD59A95041CA
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x1C35200237681EB68948EF13C36ECE98
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0x8FB94B159FE8715C18D5CFC973024DDC
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x63587C6B640681F2515686885A50CD32
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x922FFBE93D4226536BCBC7BE1561A9C4
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x7001AA135277A1D1A38531A37A4329B0
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xC5830C7C17D2B391F4005CCA94710020

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x4802BBF589840EA241A93C0825ACD179

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0xD9FCFAA993741736C9F28413CAE59A24
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0xA7CD09EEF2CACA167068B306B0801D83
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x1E56231DED8203E632BD3E4A5B644C69

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x95CAAF21444A573D5D62E6F56DA63FBA
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0xF8835980F17715EC2AD872898B72E20D
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0xA0F251F7604C7634D193D063C0642508
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
0x5F8AEC679AB9258AA2526BDF6F5B3271

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x96BC16187563D65DD890B2509782B976
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x5D7E5281D185E87B0E21FCBADE48BB2C
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0xB2413A9B757C8D31A531FB3CF50884D7
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0x6F3B07898CCA8E32174FC29B799E9DEA
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0x1B5B179A190F8E28E38E4741891B61D0
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0x042CFCDCCB598B6AB19A78E36C9E158A
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x543BB303A9E005D4BE2D28EC9639FD9C
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0x2CAE65283336A789D7061E49EF4FC9FC
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xD1EFF8B8C4BC4EC7A6DC1E5E9B35B952
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0x8BDD6C7DAA8B61584B03E634265A58FF
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0xD947F7087573FD7F8A1B8A0C8015D6F8
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0xBA6DE2B19BBF768A00060BCA7B18A268
enjoyment.
0xC496EED51BCB50EC99C80E4438E1786F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0xAF94FEE9838E805F7AFFDF2F3543E635
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x7D69DD9915E2189EE712C0714297E1F6
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x7FF5841B1D9B4121EB29D449EDCF50F9
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x92DE30058D920D5E301A8463EF5BB3D8
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
0x70D9BACAB4095491691795154BACA8D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0x8CC386F7BAE2A69DEED6AC0202A9C2ED
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x81784EDE041065BF697C26E00D711F1B
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must

really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
0x7ECCE8CAFD503E3C0853DEB7742D2622
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
0xA0D104C3B963306241AA3750E621F923
like an ordinary mortal?"

communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
0x33892106E4433BFCB56A20B58F015E52
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."

comprehend better."
0xF0303275C0809EC7352BF7573F7FF4F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty

thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x76A525FDD19132820F0EB37FC95C0443
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
0x18D3E6A50E0333C9507D02715822E9C8
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the

fortune that has accrued to them."

other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0xDDA98E4FEAAAD40CB23E28699D909CAD
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
0x07F2197ED0EC73E399136562774C0148
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
0x62BCA8C900C1A31B8BC990C8E1B49356
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x83B946C2B4019F6DCBED1DAAC95AA6A8
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x65048AB7EEDFFA470BFA2ED28EA253D1
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
0x1E9A40453570EBEA4B9F47281FC9326D
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely

superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about

"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,

the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
0xB612E2EF149D1D93C003F2E3A537AEED
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
0x88A850D79D95FD74C3A13E1A6467BBCA
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,

"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of

conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
0x7DA8348666DA75DEFD14119DFFBA5D3B
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a

of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it

fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or

0x4501EF4E84690381B4BE7D86C26F6D60
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0x07E99E6134B6B2966A679CE93E4DD824
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
0x175F597F441A0DC339EF426885710817
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
0x63EFEEAD5623393390008C32A7F4D789

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
0x45EEB9A5712148D0CB692467A52940DE
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
0xF6330CE8FF7425C0684817A4C59D91D8
scruple."
0x4C97BCD7241DD2F08FDC0072A7446215

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
0x84840A98AD3BD071FDC3F357266228BA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
0x208E0E850909F0A639124E8CE95C9A0B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
0x36A321344B4E0FEAA72032A044FFE712

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
0xE6DEEE2CCA7AEC48E8873CF7D9170905
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
0x68607A0166ECB82CBC3AF62CB1038407
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0xB84C2D2B5924E4B170FEB48AB572BBA1
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x0385DF7EB7CDFADD7D7723C40E8E510D
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0xFA796ECE2AD51C8E8962487B7E59F1AD
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xBBC3C8A1B269F886A252DFE3DB081C89
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0xFF1DBA0DEF6860BF400388A4ECB6F529
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0x3518BE2A5F850C4A3D79A297FA3FE555
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x73719B131E3AAB73BAA3324C50C8E716
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
0xA2E7DB025A2FCF392062FE4C4D101871
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
0xBB3820D2B356E9E10D9D7D16D171A832

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0x76AA74E7AAE78D49006FB4D31A2B0CD1
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0x33B9382D043537E88B8D1A9F153126EA
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0xAD7F0EAFD7E47E457A8422317CCA3958
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x5AB90B4873A52F7B4C4B8FB0897356A0
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xA0CA50F6981BF1478C89B5FD9A9032C1
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0xBE82063C56BA49057E6E1F9648491DAA
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0x83755AABA48EC0EBCB2DE6A45904939C
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0xF08596FF0023B21D74995793273818FA
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0xA4D262A9CED52C0EF92C91150D634309
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0xBED913BBE8E0DB5F4597F78633128B93
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xC209FD2082C83875A61C4E26689BED28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x57729E25FB2DE45C7085A881A7FEBADF
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0xC258617C04ED42EBF84DFCCEA04AF979
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0x3D24D7773E2FD5C850F314C88CAD842E
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x6733DF97A08E1809F2AFA16A942BC4DB
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0xC802F06A2E771CDB8E7004AA82C76ADB
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x15C888F96293BD099B1EB2279E7F372B
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x38D135D8AE08D5354F7224864D3519CA
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0xABAC3600D1D1D9E49A34F543C38C6AAF
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0xACCA48A426F6E74A081F000A92E193F2
girls.
0x803DA23F803DA23F1167F265394AAEBF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
0x77EE7E7261CECCAB33A02BBAF78441C2
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0x20D0A36CA15FB0B79B733F06738976FD
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0xDFBC96D889B1D4940A52A4662A9D7439

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Doubtless."
0x92128C4C874086561F51C9C42AF0F5C4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0x60F5D3FA7429AB9AE243E64CD9069FED
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0x95E24C4704613275E6DA08023A37466A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0x07C23694D442D877164ECF879AEEF3D2
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x81512801F7B69168B45D2100206CC958
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x7764A57F855CA566D13BFC2B3469D68D
it and disposed for full holiday."
0x669C3F0E6069879E2D166E1B26A51E28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x8FD6CF53F09255706718D5C7D8C5DC0E
What are you going to do?"
0xDEC73F3C549C73DD9299B8AFD2F4B20F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
0x1BB21F8E4D4A0B77AEC16900002AA5A0
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
0x45EBA31875F4AABA6C42410850820521

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do you want her?"
0x3E616CEB1D24DFD66BAA54C1E914EFAB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
0x7F42963CF7FB2DEEC79D251720A758A4
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0xC8D7C6A8864FBCEE7B23DC43423EEFBC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
0x50D379247E2993FFF331EFF0FD91EA9C
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
0x01C8AE6CE07A5E9A810B0138A05C2A8F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
0x49C35601EAE4097B805F2ECEB35829A7
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
0x4679D689BB3A5BB63A88A207D5CFD9F7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
0x9186836F7AC025651BF1054D4DB2D1DF
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
0x671DF9555463F95F0CF576306F31E1FF
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
0x2198C0EB5E37149344F7BB15784CAE74
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
0x9AF49D86581E35E868F85B5445ADDAAE
now?"
0x8625AF3A8625AF3A55B0B1C56DA1C010

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
0x1DC3396CF75174BD8E64A933360C5EFC
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
0x73440730B39E247727F36D2C4966B469
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
0xF7F0A5FD722715089EEEF988C973E8B3
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
0xC52A9C70E8C64FDF969C26BCC80E93C6
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
0x48BF940B02CFFA31E9C8666771BF0E8B
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
0x3FBC0815201C780774716C87518FE627
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
0xD17098BA1E5194EE0FFF0A3653E4D7E9
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x05ED8FA708F0032A2B1E6D38C560B6C0
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x3DC59DD41C2CD8A02FE55E65C76890D5
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
0xC7C284D1067FA4D02C544656E9386047
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
0x138D70E510124B93C9B689F81123F18B
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
0x63890222A89809EBDC10F0AA7C1A9813
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
0x8AAA5B2C5A126E3A9451D852C4F2BC05
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
0xB04EC5E99A648F7AFA011B983AFE0F5F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
0xC94E9E2704B9B94518CD94D1369B7561

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
0x027CB0EC513DCA56209F5AA80938E47A
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0xB8A92EACE047B3F763ADBD1CFD6D75EF
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
0x3F78B3B0F2BA471A1204D3BACD9594EE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
0xFA8BA8F7D4DF2E43476557A0FFC75D11

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
0xF5E9CC0CB2173B998062D33B14C40245
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
0xAD31DC81176D88A8EACC093AD0047B0B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
0x7AA13232FD724A718F6A10E2775F829F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
0xDAF2C6997AE5E8F78BB07C90B8BB5D14
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xF555F5DEC77080670BB8124578ADC270
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0x8FB8B40109191F38B871742F7154D8E0
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0xB7235464F3EB3D820A4ECBFE35A60EFC
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
0xA1403E10DF92014A7F93F8B7D4A798A0
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
0x1B5444EF07130DB25122934965B547B6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0x5B7F82E68AE65BBF803D0BE3E207ACA6
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x2BF083CF3E537A82C75FEC1FCACD285E
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x759819C11ABB1A7CE14A43582334F44E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
0x486EB7590EBBC1E6DB94AA4DBAAD33D2
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0xEAB4E7DFD875162DC61D9A34C0F2DDAB
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0x217DA3851E240BFA998369027FB42492
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x4A73DE1060FF57A760801A15B48FE2F7
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xD68FE0BAB59BAD3CCBD52E5908F4545F
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
0x8FA4D11BD97B1127733496D0BC737EE7
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
0x05E0B2CEDCFB812F684A3C952AA4BFC6
hear, Jane?"
0xD0C7A6A2FD000B486DB0333CEA62E0FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xCFB21BFC8AA36468C7FCFDDA73274115
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x63304C93BE4B354242E7285C2531E316

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0xCE9FB4E4306FC5D2C1457C9005A20763
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0xB6C6842EF2B69E00B5E5939FCFDEFE04
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0xD384056B6642EEE1141115C1CE3850A4
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0x3B7236AA3F8A8624575439B6286DEF32
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0x39B7EF9DDEAA8311A900DB017B97DCB1
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0x572977697529D7970176EDFF5475F045
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x01CBE4CCDF725E478A0FBC739D5B9462
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x0C15A0909110448E67521954568C86B5
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0xB8918C716B461DF312586CA34F9C1048
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0xFB36205EB6A8D709E7D113F93D8CD5B2
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0x8D138DE1370A9384A79B1EF82BFB9007
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x68A4A51938B042884ADD565C8F2399C4
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x621CC613DC0DD13955A9723A7F46F3D4
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0xC4DD5FA3414EB3AB5B079C55D3FAA24D
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x9CDD4F2C480DE50A68DCE6422A449A0A
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0x03269F4798192DE43AB1FE636C21282D
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0xDC6F5BA1EA6E604F0B87B9F0905CEB41
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xCA9B70BD2D0459A417A7FA8C96286E9D
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x8E9C4E12A4CA5E8E45EED095F305850E
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0xFC16041ACB436235A93F0ECB1129287B
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x1356BEE83ADC70B15958D89FE87840D9
without.
0x3674BB47176F1F611F01545A6B2B5199

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0x7575CE598653072C15F45F5349621C69
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x40BADC1E29B0005C516D2877857EB242
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0xCC05FC6C93F5DC188B5100932CD9FEF9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x83E8C029F316C1294481F8AFA9A6A176
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x41645771F8FF9E6821C2CAA78285C190
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xAC1BC4ADA6B0E39BECD2102EEBA737DA
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0x871E29BD28DA6592FBF959B06628BE77
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x589240FDAFC915E99B2C93795A47765C
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0xE9F9E709116BED24B041223E8878CB1B
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x75E1D959CFBA6E116A65FF63A7717E7D
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x9AB6AA75BC6E9661DB71B2EEDF7B9006
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0xD56DC85C74AD81E186A91FAC3C3828B8
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0xD6CF454F51E05EB09F8B355DC291F88C
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x2225E15D9B632ED0A24744ACD73E0FEF
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0x02C9A84C663B2951F1B2CD4E36741A76
improved aspect of his abode.
0xC27CCDF7CE6ADAA0449404F32AED81FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x306500B26769732D1115BC60356BD0A5
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0x305B1044A7A20FA467F8BC59C95C2197
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0x2735E8B1625DC32991D1B7E9BDF8E490

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0x789FC1F33CC651AEE646F223C777F504
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0x53B68F4106723BC93A719B8AEE173C19
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x79D1144380A2ED73F2CD6DFA98378B59
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xCEC677898CD5E114193C192A883FB389
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0x0A06B0E8196B461083615C403FF674DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x8B5192FDE51623EE5A9D3D155A97AABC
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0x9D684430FB262CACC2598B4444F71BE8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0xB90538229DFA9CA8D2110439F5A6D652
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x625A1D166DFF88E882EFC7A9716C1B24
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0xC3F486F038C2651F0D7A2E1DA8F923E1
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0x5A55CA9B45E79905871274C62BA01004
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x20E42DD8C72CAAEBB804F7267801749C
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x565CA106CA705321611749AFF98DCF18
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0xC95CF1776C5D0550FE0924CE3197B7D0
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xAC913DF9D4C8BF6B47A07FF83C839308
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x032D8DA229D75BC68773EF6417ADD66B
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x604075A9112662F127B69E816F65558C
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0x4C9B2696B013FACD5F93C0E81E1678FB
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0xE5E18662492A973C757DDE7B14C93D4A
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x4E549715A89C7CD9E7FEDE368294E437
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0x2A9DAEDF211A6D903EB7C5C2B9B69322
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xE9EF0100F32A64982C853AA546871DE9
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0xE4E069B0712C0F56ED07DB12295BF8A0
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x85F9218AE83E4A22E785952B3ABCDD4E
column, gloomy and out of place.
0x559068DC6FD8913474BBD2DB27E6A946

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0xBA1DFA261D83F589BC229FE7B3AEF93B
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0x9AF8D3855CF04F4F50AE4F6C75063EE4
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0xF2AE847C9D07C397A673116DEC56CBA4
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0xD8C8E041BEF145DF70FDE3910D1B1B84
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0x19BB241A8D8EF5A1819261368E2C6242
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x73D364E3284583F2B4C8605C811CD64C
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x3C73AC0D17503CCBC30F700B57FE3EBE
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x5BE14996CC1B6256CFFC695958E7D7EE
career--I see it now."
0x25F058878EDC108528952FFCD1795B68

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0xC97DE85AE431785D33C75E0C14148539
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0xABEF0C952E07CCD27F982F7B5EC8DBAE
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0x7CE62AD7AAAD9202D5EF3EB0693F7D03
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0x6D6B8A8151086D700FB500422CF68958
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0xAF06F4932DBBB7A8DA97DB18FC836C60
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0xBDD8590EA463CC2B56CC039F293ED5EF
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0x3D7642C89A40EDFBCDE6DDACC9F6F161
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0x83150C62C331F49E83F8F81ED0148B0B
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x0D17A02F5255FD93B578B94873C7A0BA
into the house.
0x0699A0492A2E9A14E64F31A42EA96671

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x549072AE023F91737F7D990C3882DCEE
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x3E1751DF577C491FCF83CF25AC70986B
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0xA2527FA8F1CF1BA8A2434A87BA819893
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x2F03E5A916B1C3C5BD78A582A5C9A594
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x1669D26F91D4D6F385B17D84B3E5B2C6
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xA9EB1C9953037A23A8EA731A75E8C53F
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xD005495E8C9D79953200355050B8C6EC
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0xEEF83552FCF227228F15B9884B98AC5C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xA2BD17CDCCF9A89CB0AA30C89328DFFA
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0xDA14389F53D7AAD8632E0975A75AE89E
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0x5B99077D88495B4004E2FADEE581C9A1
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x46EEC03A68A2462076B83D6B6DD28C9B
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0xF40E0504EA9344F41482102D2F8607B7
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0x7489AC69C940B38AE45B4F927099F39E
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x874A6CEB29DF6325ED5A7B7A26F23C8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0xC43A8FC31D0208CA268FDB1C4138C56A
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0xF4F9DDA3EE3B8699A23A250FBEA38928
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x8BE0652CC769FB4CDD52343C9A09CCEA
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0xD99F0E6DB9770C1EC245BE5852DB9C26
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0xD1970844D23B5A8BE7C3F11DEEA79597
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0x1807AFDD26BBD40DAD5227B46AC32FD7
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x15143DA0954F90CD421F23C1817BF929
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0xD1A4AA1B2D6ED1A35A04121C52CB0E3F
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0xD09486BD47F6BD7BA90785050018A1F5
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x1881BF6B74B8000527B9566CBC209E9E
mother, who was drawing away."
0xC9D9C22292E1AC5B7DAC5BEACEFB4ABA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0x8BC6F9182406E1C23CAD3CF51DD73AFC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0xC22A5C5CE02B6D8374268D5AC25AA8F9
the way."
0x6A58D20637A8CD5191DA78F9B387E4E9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Tell him I will go."
0x994AC23AE7039BD70EC4005CFCBBFAF8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0x2CB49FC31FB226E8A63CC71911A2CE7B
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0x0DAC4C005969CC563DC1FDF684D98151
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x60896E4BCF74B7C707E07F50F27D21F5
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0xF5FE21831D726BCE89544CCF9D433E82

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x3E1C95854D80A6ECC2AB284EFCEEEBCE
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x32C32A19B2EB2F9EB618E58C0A1C1E16
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x660BBC1FB38D57B0AFDA821EA64A27A2
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0x7D282C71F6FF874352F496B4D27B65BF
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0xA8092A68175492B6A4F1A9E1B53A091D
with himself.
0x7202DF6313144C28490242B868DA186C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0xC97DB696F3BFD74C5F1FC34C29816FA1
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x4DDB4A530005C73E7433DC99EC19B3AA
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0xCF2C6E9426E3FBD66A0874E6D3D8E125
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0xD8C79FD0BA3CC126431EBC4D7509C81B
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x966134B796DFEC41E8179EFF697162CF
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0xA7F4B0CD141E046B020E3A764AC5094F
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x99DB2E79895FC820E227C07280CC81D1
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0xD78F248296AAD4F69146D9180D456401
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0x0EED9C010B80E63EA2C3AFEFCF293BF2
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xFAB6C7DA4BACA8B84420961F0D789E36
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x8404A097D1E4B919DB9AD124DDDA87CE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0xC04D176DE404778490FBD2B4CAA71A1E
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0xDF8F17E936D8B37B4324938FD9C634B5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0xEEE6FE15DC4CE8C36D4535FF5C6D1EA8
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xE93C6046DDDE521BC03D4264C9EC5AB1
ensuing year.
0x84B797D9B940D03DAC148B2F740D3D45

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x84BF00F6035B725236942A99CCC2AD08
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0xB40E34FC8EE1C6B3EF95441A5681E191
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0xC4208B0D862E4D09692E30A0AF330275
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x9EC6D37E678A1A377B1EEABF32C621FD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x4C194E63B186983620F52E7E44B27F3A
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x526F714B048572EB26C6B671831171A1
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0x93BA4126E9582DD2A85FF905D2FAA41E
yesterday."
0x772EB053AAA6ACD95C7D69E6E88D5721

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x1C0C9BA1415E1942077F773F81C6F2E2
he was serene as glass.
0x63847C0D606685792B499EF9C318045D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0xA3FF5A7F0D22D17A0E73D357493159F2
known each other long."
0x37AD962A89F2AE6D76613FE288700F7D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x617670F5BE2A479E891A410A64252D45
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x17FDE2B8BD8ED0B0A3ACBC860EF2FF07
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x1A19F1B5C896618F8EC08813D300C2A9
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x834F1C4E39C936CFC6AEA6C686B92C98
can he refitted for their reception."
0x24F78166EEF9E790C8E16033C36E8524

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0xB2B0FAFA3DE646422C7E00475667BC09
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x5654705378C2A47D72E46705D5942A8B
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0xF3086C2E78487F93C2FBB2D93EA077DC
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x5C1102838CEA45F58048C5C055ED52AC
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0xEEB55366088A93841CF3069177FAB4B3
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0xB605A5CC341D691A26B7227E8160408C
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x3120CD118447A84AFE9651E7DB8E5853
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x551B9E875C0A69964FC3F280FBF52864
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0x9D46C54FBF5B8329831D2F6C9CFE9EE0
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0xC43449E9CA4D27D3F42C944D39840E52
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x55757F01E39ACBC839D273822D15E540
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x8947AD7F1DB4183BEF6153DA3FCD0E03
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0x000442775FAC37155D4C1F1F68D9585A
frigidity.
0x87C7703DA9FF90D8E17E87B0F597D321

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0x16553931B4E188FB91E39D6ABF75CA7B
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0x7223EB587784AEBE311C0B5C1EA41F19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0x3813BB246DABB2A7D1F775058E2A681A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0xABC03C95CAD6072676DFEE3A71957087
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xA02FADFC64079BCF71073CB0FF9C36C5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x20603C1A72173185BAA63C729956E05D
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x408B88906B29C4706639681F2EDEE321

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0x066E6EEBBFCA904539C0F34D4A7429EB
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0xEB10AE71CC08C16FC642836EDE4DCCB3
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0x04D06B70543E6A7F05DA226A9AEA046A
returned to his papers and his silence.
0x524B6C688C1A87A78723ED2D585AC788

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0xD158C95785C4BAF1635357BCDC8505F3
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x0D207F388B1F2756E1CF7AC42B0EE7BA
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x385828C39E69C61637908A9277435C7C
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0x5B903DDB5E35D398D6ED1DEF634C6DBF
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0xF141816AB3E3B30BCB33D194E226ADCD
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0xD44C1DF8FD3D423D1C984CA546118F56
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0x3E83E59AD3F35F9FEE2ACE1983BF8044
plans.
0x6E0681D56E0681D5747A08765D06B2C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0x12142F19A4E0B9D025033593B165AFFD
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xB118F403E1FA04248E0CFA14E7F19F62
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0xBB9FABD5A636F98C9500E917EB34123E
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0x478001320ED385DA8D1289945D0B147D
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0xFAB2A86B1A5DB72A548C9E1A9BEB5E17
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0xAAEF2A8CF75A6683DE4B15DFB181D389
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0xDD6A9A3A13957EE3D7B7FF0D8A44384B
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xA686BF3345EE8BC717D42386DDADB821
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0xD7AD74EE8BD1059EEBF732A35DF6CB68
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0xE7A75DC3232F6C031D08ACF24BA9800C
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0xF0AD9921CF1AA4DE216FC115F62F7C20
the task without regard to the elements.
0x5E98DF71F76F17DC6F80D27F9E07A307

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xEFA05AD04B9B2A43821791E09A809318
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0x68E7EF066548B023FBC6C9D656D3104C
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x3F8CA00E528C40B1DA4BB91459E6DDAC
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0xDE758DE36A9FA6D93CC293A437D4C1D0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0x66D00A4D2C325C690E1E04CED1C7D266
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x53B2591649B8BABF722C2B219539BA6A
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x95820C36F9667F7FC39F313FAEF63408
was a special annoyance.
0x99EEE0301B6FC880D317154C1FBE43CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xA9D9BF3A00388C966C436E2207AE967B
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0xB86CA3A0D77AE4D91B5A33DF75133254
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x0FC7D7A4357DDE9F0B8C1B1E9CFE4B38
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x751D9561450AB72D6E2EE9EDA040FE56
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x0FBC40D69A06444842C5424383ECAE4F
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x9260B356DE4894616A0ABB18BA1C8F94
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0xA4A21763FD6410C98150E7B988C64C7B
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0xCF437DBA46077E2B6237E0636993FDEB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xE45315E6B988C94F5BFD01BF9F045145

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Learning German."
0xAC6C4B8F2B3C6E7DC2D2CD472854C00E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0x61D84862DB21A3527F041A7CE69E3C4D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are not in earnest?"
0x7355C0B9B6FD5531E5A8E59090B84736

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x0A3ED9D526E6851AD07FB8777E6AC547

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x423573793235A9A788F1388F06DCD8B6
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x09E47C4C2EE622AB0D94D347240F2A48
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0x9B82CA9EAA4E11E26027BA75AE759E95
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x129CB7CB5D11B8312B1FF62E86DFD342
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0xC71F32CD7B05E088C79042CA72E2A19D
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xBE69B3EA825B6A1F2A0487B2D61B1045
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0x9CE6D564E79EF9B5654C1D4E4E52A694
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x5DACA2DD7E7CA67D8EC1786D3ED6DF1E
barely three months to his departure.
0x043803EDECB48506373872736872AB5D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0x4DE6F04A038FBAF2FE962B8EEA464A87
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0x5C96D38FF00B760F14BDD857DB46EBE7
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x7D81DD1BB69ED69F63226CF4AF9A528E
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x22F9230653BFE4B6E91760B5F50FFCCC
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x1DA7B7CB1A70D63E84352F3C8DFA51D0
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0xAE1405D34943F93B72FC7051D4A3CEC2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I know it."
0x7A50BD17087290BB3DD8102A37503B38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0xA2A88895F70CB2C630572C1752F6E91B
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x70BBCD19AA29D317ECBE3B21D731C54F
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0xF591A9AA63D1C33C654C65100FA87193
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0xAAC91867D3058FB9EF90E0D115BAD24D
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x3725A12A581B30EDE6D264739EAF7EC6
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x73C245518236FA8B77B5B5BF78034463
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x24365679E64860813AED53D5AED70968
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x0C93E6165E56E2076320A7171D0B8B89
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0xC340F97CF4AB9EC61ACF3D7428C47A83
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x866E4DB2D039CB7920C8EEE70BB43A41
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x8CAA20266CFED8FD8FF72A102F5B3EF6
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0xACB08EC93C062913164025A00F0E9676

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xAE231F1FCF034B3DE2EC98B196A41D85
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xE0FF99C8FE0A12412119C59351F4C4B8
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x27C317C662DFE34A660B10C8649C809D
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x98989598FDDD64182D4AF30F043FEA4D
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0xCA39E855E4E1BEEC9681A83328B3D66C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xE44C129F4832CF0EFAEF1A6765D1EAFF
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0xD9E6FEF8B1E17FA043B72E698AE9379C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x1DF284FE6969F308A1692A06AD48B025
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0xF5B03D8527CAD0ED77FB561D2C8EC7EC
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x115D61A7C225C1BF2672E6751E844C14
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x6DC5CF6239151DA91362FD43CF79123B
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0xF016CCC48E59E6001727AE788A48CF83
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x74705D7D30FC75E9ADB8E6D938BC7AE7
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0x201F1235C902634FD338FED50ABADC20
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0x7F151A92402E079737546C70DC38CA7D
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x757A428A7310FAE8D518F240D3A2AC65
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0xD5B501C8520368F7D3D10E4941232AAF
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0x831325D1B3FAB3C4BD343B79CCD9F98D
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0x03D6469CF5EE4C6BCEF7721C61751F4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0xA93F5FD3870B017F5ADDB3D1A1997372
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0xBAD4B49B0A7966521F475D7B4F63484C
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0xABDAF1D3622878BC7EBCFD069A955616
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0x16165E36D82FE6E825528DC014F1CA3E
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x264A8E578ACB2EAF906831855A94233C
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x460965B31EA0FFA62D41FB536594639D
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0xC285E25ED0E6CBD37984D80025657CC6
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0xD6F059D3CEC8973AA17B87CCB6D85B5E
own.
0xF3ED8E44F3ED8E440A774AA39F4B1583

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x3FA853701E56476E92DA0331E29071B1
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x8271E91DB8996DE9353C7B39CF0D461C
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x2024C3476CB7DC27AD477A918357F692

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0xDFC180A0C38E01915E46386F0FEF1F15
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xA52CA75893706BEE610E8133EBB83442
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0xF438DCB080099BDE84A226B0D2E0E725
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x373ED85326F756DACA7294DB9A5A7EB5
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0xD7000E6890A4F428D1C6EA7488D055EE
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x53BEEE94A4ACACE69D5209339C427932
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0xB964320EF1AB1985F38AE61EA087939E
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0xF5F074DE1BEDBDCEC7B3D253BC9D5218

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x64BA62DBB24F293BB5B085B0E956F275
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0xACD11A56D4748F610D169EA885F061DE
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0x69813C290440F6A8CAB79D5314450C8E
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0x163226B743E4AD694920DD6E43369CBA
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0x42ACB7F38124E85F90AEE0A9662EDA38
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0xABD2EC4DBDC7E1A1F61EC068DC97DD15
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x143C8D1CF85FAC45447623B5E050C514
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0xDC52D440CEBC612B17B8FE88B302FAC4
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x7998D13641CDEE22B633813AC98E9BAF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0x07F7623702E5C17922158630FA99FAE1
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xCC566535AFDB901AD3EF10A530112184
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0x9233D436843D907D8EDFDECDA7EEAFBD
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0xED80D04F697110D7D2003BCAEFC7CCFE
then I felt dark indeed.
0x1FA9A6AD0F502C1336A324B551EB677B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x61D318FE883211B5FA7987190F9506C1
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0xEB8D6C625612C3AE530AA3444A5C5EC0
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0x2659069151BE210B46825745246A18DF
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x56A3CAE0E0A9838DD44D8B63B3311795
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0xACCB8B93F16A1F72E389E2DB79D029C4
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x4E6D1A05A109C8F37CFDCBBAB437D832
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0x8631CFAA3996D03BF68E4F82A2DA3793
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0x5DACEB37CA9F715E005009DFB088C829

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0x51E91221C80BF73A33E49CEA3331B6AD
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0x41C786F56635FC3D5A6AD523A88FAE5A
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0xB8BA2BE2690FB98A9501181360D5D49D
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0xAC22EC88D5A3908B07FD84B044EB8D2B
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x0218DD2CE30DECA0AF3A07267C8B327A
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0x7289EE7F2C298B0E0DC9B158B4847ABD
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0xCD365F3C4AF53E274F04969AF76D7E84
eyes filled again.
0xEFAC5D68D954F17D383656EA6E829BC4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xBC7F3842F4DB52FD86E8052D2A3FB7D4
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xF5EBA0CC3B7845DDFC7AE7DF2B2F9D95
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x22C02A19A7EA7D6D31F935A6243EEC29
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0xA5FC9D5DE25978122CA9152644EBC487
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me

as to its cause; he only said--
0xF37790D95AFB69F6E8AD38711805D9FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0x4163DD49BB5E44F4DAB16DCBC24B9B14
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x35B4EA29530F6180CC6F611E3F9120E4
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x8C089E5264DA2E1FBDE35D20B340FF12
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0x97D7E88379E05F6A42B369CD8A8A5E89
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0xFAD5EAB1420211C41898712A1C2F9F13
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xE04C052C5A721FEF113D94B751CADED5
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0xFDD2BD69B5E09B31C8887AAFAAACF076
said--
0xED2ABE6DED2ABE6DFFECE641E1E5B044

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0x1687DA455594400C8335B1630DD678DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0x1C9D9F735F255AABC4FD4F24E225F26B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0x5EC5F609FD5188634F09CE941308FADC
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xFC68461FDC68FF1426A3FB130108A2F7
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x81D9D057215DEF86321CA193512AB35A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x5C612D1467B4E91AF2C059F723384486
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0x688949E20CF92F1A9792D6DE9E43999D
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x7E98FD787CE64D752EB088179FED70D1
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0x215D6EDBDF93ACE5A68B3150C56996BD
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x2F50BA8AA778D0514A658101F495F405
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xF436B2C147D97848C4B957C84A968ADB
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x699EC739F6C45E66ABCB68115DCC73CF
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0x67C73D3C5608E40B2CC7FDDA1595B583

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0xC08B5CF5E527609693BC970EF671254C
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x0F02A3A4A9FE09594060259E4B37466A
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0x67E4142270FE8D4CD5E53CEDEABCB638
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xB3F8D33F6EF07567C0B0C48A27001CE3
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0x4108932DEA4B71435FB37DD072361017
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x8876B0692C458131E6647DAB0C02B83E
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0xEEB3D2E0ED11E93DCCE5545E6375E807
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x2D85B676B2A06AB8F5BEB00CBE64AF42

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0xB238AAC952BD0A8F9625185B110384CF
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0x171081AB8D97F5E8A56BBB0207CDC151
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0xC870E09802533E66502C8C38B595BCD8
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xF831FAA03F6A62A68758A0907FB3F155
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x03EC6847352A39834F476E8EF7A56A08
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0xD0D92B41A23AE73FCEA10DD1AC92A4A5
last refuge for silence.
0x54451C5C0D1BD0111C911CA4AEF9F48D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0xE1401F167379EDC9F4058BFCA92BB951
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x13C88367E67DEDD91378677A4E29A9A6
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0x32C1946C7A0D43C039EBCAC0EC4C725E
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0xEA8428F7066B9E7B78AC3CF48A5F50C4
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
0x7ADCC29CD9A70236C46AB61FD5010D26

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
0x1BCAD5A984D94DD90079D753E35195E3
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
0xFE6CF726B42A4B4508EE9D053B270428
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
0xB31D0700FBE3FCBF900773824CB57165

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0x8E00F347281FCA379AD64DE6F8094EFF
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
0xBE18AE6E95D1F568787436637562CFB2
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
0xEB64E20A816442F1F23A2A15486FF24D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
0x460205E4FC7BD0A265CEDE9246534237
sails on the 20th of June."
0xEDC8F54F3982033B95966E3FFA75EA6A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
0x935AF8B5FC8B929B4E91E2551501F43E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x490C04A5B85DB23E9B9DC50C08B84DEE
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x0BAE4360E390CA228F9B03F45F378166
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0x2168241E5C6B5821EB520B2AB1D39A02
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xB1D1FFFE3596A15C5C2C581D97A88E3C
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
0x51F7EF8C189A28F9FBE0FDA7BF78E81E
same enterprise."
0xA5311BD761EAE466CBAE1123C822A8E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
0xF5421DD0EBB1B72A05DDCA86FB504965
to march with the strong."
0xCE29511390EFC6E7615DE36851B7BAC8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
0x926FA9953E8006AFFCCDB8C248942D2F
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
0xF816A9B8706A07D876F009294C54B01D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
0x3BE5D5369375C715CAA82A424F5C94DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
0x1F872BEC0FAB73EB27AE047009323BA4
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
0x8755F6CE504E46D3353EDF8D603F898E
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
0x30FAB251629881A6C2A90D5C932F1ABB
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
0xECF27DA8F61DB2ED382CD842FA0700BB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
0xD4B73B1D3AAA9650FFBCFB3F1E19CABB
the first to inform them of it?"
0x69ED3B70C09DA2B1271FD56DB9305245

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
0x591639F3938A6D2D252C9780DCDD7148
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0xE6D4E4ED1EBED98619C86BAF4A8813C2
rivet the spell.
0x16F4766E2E3651077766E6015AD0F96C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
0x94F5089F073FE66CC328F8CA6901A83F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
0x613F0996AD00C111F408881CAD0EF6DA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0xED2AD94349A2DC12A6322819EEECE5BD
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
0x1BECE79B64341D789206812EE995C4E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0xE92A5C7E3E726B8E490D8B5505A57F8B
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x1A0A5A1CDD354EA0ECC12C0DEBE0CBFC
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x2919509947B4D5AE98DABF9EF527C9F6
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
0x0406BC31F4064410FD7DC28A47E363A5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
0xEAA1C261E948A4C567B974D087A65575

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0x5748A663C4EC36241031C84629DA46CC
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
0x08C742475712AD35769F4E60BFE24A1A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x6D1C220CAE1EFF575530029257E30691
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xB5FCC7C6EC6ED10675B746D4CC78C246
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0xF2175951C259B39A24A1167E8FBB5DE6
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x781985CE828EDFCDBD3CA0C1752D2AFA
service."
0x4902B5F2760C68931516F6062CDCA229

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
0x2CD109E723785D58173D1CC227E63096

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0x0CAD5AA53904E08DF41B25D8ADD77688
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xA81474947D4B10A5887F1769FD4B63E4
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x54061F6252B884371D007B14E3A04296
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0xDA6151B8ACEB02E4C9194C3C13B0F1B6
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0xD77440418B7D70778E94928B9A670FDB
for him.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0xEB7D12A1D61F66FAFF453A10A5C79CCF
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0xA5BB0EF8FA6B0CEF3322302EEBD4DD0C
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x3FD575F15729D250F8F5962C647886D8
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x8CD2A06BEE7760F35A6AD2572FA69F7A
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0x029ACDC98F12714071CB1BB1FEF20940
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0xD2AF81236FAF58AD691763B3B232FFFA
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x6FB4B34E6804193A3559D96131E8AD79
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0xF9B6A77E28D50D41FE5D29058AEFED9E
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x8B97B9C1291785E3D56A422EEDD4735E
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0x2ED527141DB23826AAF7D6C092055ABF
bear the weight of your human weakness."
0x204F1ACFDFB28ADD99D90DA6ABB2CD56

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
0xCFE2751A90129D13E9B5057404FF5CB3
labours."
0x31921F08AEC9CE614542FFFFB72DF4B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you

your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x7450B709AFFEDE0E273B7D5E9D481B13
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x3FADF2E94A344E8DAB0ADA798A823682
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
0x479A7458F946422A7DDE737E39F8C1A7
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
0xD483E5A84079853AE7A0C89F230B201F
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0x0DE1189965D14215D97EB8FE76E5673F
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0x38E2B6FF186B6237530918EB432825BA
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0x93F6EEB52DDA8F23BC8CEA14E5A1B183
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
0xCC5DDAAD50C11BBBDB7499EAB5A857B7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0x152151571D396EACC684DE1A265B8BE6
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0x6482844C3F01BCAD72FA663E7EC8B5AC
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0xAD31A29AE2A4E9B2E146E57BD81FE796
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0x971E7B800D825875D8F83F95FC9172A5
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0xC3D1CFD43FFF6A65225FE30C20E672FC
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x72954CA601FAD088E6BED6E54D7D36F4
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0x8226253A2F154F46988ED1FD128A8C92
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x87D4FE8BFE609950AB6F776F7D9567F1
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0x347959475B0B362DB98B89239D39BD52
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0xD377A315C9919DFDDE867F02EB9C7A32
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xF0F9C06DF23A5DD3AC269CD197BD37B2
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0xE0EFEB5AC1626F9898A2D105DA4C9646
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x343F70C3BBE21C15A123FEE03C2DC2D3
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xC390070AD0537C12FB75A8EB55C8190D
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0x4AA75B17A63A5C025611BE9B78F9974D
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0xF0F45AF660CC4DF3474D509A28EFDE9C
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0xCC3F14CF1A99BD0AA3F0F99598070E68
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0xDA054ECD4590E06FA80DF2DB2E740586
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x7718EDEECDDB41FA2DE1329F8A5117F6
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xD61C71D2578CDCEF67A5FB50014C2297
be to me invaluable."
0xEDF34AEE7018FEECB08371E6798CC49B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0x001111E5860BE9EA8DB9003827FCFD59
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x24BC6CED0C835790FA7B28DB4050D948
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x65D8D396BF50F1640C7F4924858490CC
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0xB1F7CBFCB4476C1E6DA5DED37679A469
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping

hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x2536B9A2E84B2969A5DBD031995F2E01
think, before I again hazarded a reply.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
0xA246D0CE1C0B8C85B9CF3A0F335432A3
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.

"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
0x842BE8A4283CCD4D78E826B85BC1DF27
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
0x366A9C63ACA426D8B8F53E03B22FB910
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x4DDB40B85EBDEE83CCA48DD00DB1408E
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0x4E9EA10AFAEAEDABE242E5671C402BC3
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x96F1E9636B46193EDF899A5B9DA59478
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x30ECD820AC210ECAFA4C90A163E9F20F
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0x7E15E4F173E73039328ACB154F22AF0D
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x20484DA7020E55D8BAB17380946268A0
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x31F5377B39389008757EAF3AABCF3CBF
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0xD36287FFD5541F451E9663E9191D19CE
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x8455319F595F6FB3D5A4757981034D42
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x4D4F79057C31C6C201EB02FB4EAEFECC
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0x178EE3CBADC4EE464F613C2A0E9C6361
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0xAF26C3DCD4069E65227434BAAF440BDD
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0xB5412D5796FCC0FA20D084B79EFFCC40
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0xACBD0F19495BE175C2E193B3FE7C5EC1
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0x7D9A5B6A35101D6D8503A63F84B26D17
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0x59D77924F3C320E99DA64F40BCF8F775
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0xE7D41B9F60FC40C3650064648ED9CED2
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x51AEB627B1EF33714CE97E44697D393E
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0x1FBA0B503BF1AAA25EA6846DBF2F048D
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x85B4A8706C050CE01F7EC1F36F01413E
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0x37C999B1BDE54BCDD480A6FC7D45D248
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0xCB82F9450F877BCA34062A09EE04D2F6
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0x517244CDE651B4C236DA65BF231EA5C1
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
0x9987EE05052CCD2E5DC5F66F748054EB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
0x8282ECA360D596D6540DB8D0EEA485A4
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x64321DABE9C3FCC1D6C31202CB7FABF5
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0x61C4BC03AE7B671521F9CC88455F23D1
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0xFA046D60E3B96FF232E8CB88123AE304
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x358F285C295AE9789D8ACB70F28BC954
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x0FC5CA9650F1CF929DDA9EE50A0A3471
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0xF8351B55AE01FD19E5210D39010A0AA3
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xD0088B1181B59A26756D7E6D4E8717BC
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0x2FF58C79E4BEDC879057905C28603B10
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0xFDF384B19FC0DE1213E2A7061E847986
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x0C4F8EF52A457C4DFB8194C9A1E3002D
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0x1D25FB9C266ECAA3BFE3D1919EAC1971
I will tell him so."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0x74A93AEA4242B964DA47C7A738A68EAF
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x4E2F27EB1C348F224D453865041F36F7
his feet and approached me.
0xEE7E95DB544FC00A0E44299B1D247E07

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0xAB0857B69C586900CE25287C5A9F7877

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0xA4463B5643334604029CB330F865FC94
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0xAAA988F2DD8EF74AB520EC9EDAF1843D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x9354FD84F5A9AF0B63AB11C71C5958A0
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0x2F38C77460FA9FA7CD066291716F896C
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0x554AC92A7126A62C7A701868FFFA0518
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0xD041E0A9889FDBBA9287E7F658182C93
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x27F7A0326D877B2CC405DEE367E283AD
sense will guide you."
0xC4EEA13201D6569CFF7EAF3A30E5A748

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0xF5193651653718FC907E524B5227FA17
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x8E1E923BCF905A79BF9F2A46A1F99BEC
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xB2B0AFB6BEE02750A7E33447446D5489
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0x6AAEE552D7BA804224774F0D7649A7FC
continue."
0x2DB87A225372847112ECFAE2918FBFAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0x9D65FD03E7A9489F6F1BA426DF4E1286
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x538BC094C219C47E822DA2D9CC845174
have said that."
0x429AC932CCAD5130A07E0A5DAE85C374

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Conditionally."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x4A73C31373A3B4B0C049F256A50A1865
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0xB501AB714B27ED77BDFFCA202E3AE97F
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0xD152EAF78DB3A000BBF9ABD07DB013C2
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xA5FF07617A9E73B51F20D4134B33E774
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0xEE119C8574907736270663CC18353F77
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0x8D9FD0ECDB562C631552C7F50C12633A
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0x1B38594D791280A95FBE5E1AE3D2181A
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x12E0740C2373608D14AF59577E092E72
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x7A7E263878175C2D876551BDD35EFFF0
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can

influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

my limbs.

you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with

myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For

them he has no use: I retain them."

"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0x5E3D8EADA8970DF6C6383581AA0445C0
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0x3519DBE1FB803CD867A78C4347CE4375
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0xEBCDCA2B884074D0BF438EA83F94F224
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0xCF226C7C27B5D487ACAB5B9CFB621330
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x7CA2696F7BE85CEA4E55A9A196729017
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0x5607DF9E38CEFB2D30AA2B5549F7E8E3
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0xA5E39992795B44E18093077AB1DC0873
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x86F6F8DD1BB30D75C1F87373E56C383E
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0x38A2EC5D2EF4901A1A083AE61F9EDAB1
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0xD0CA79207A15950B182E100EDE85DA09
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0x3CA2A7A327781D8FF18B5E91BBCCAF51
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x542CBDC7591113A58545D627699533A4
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x75E6B3AA96AFF65E62E20C33CA61EE71
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0x011EC5CF24B336A555D90843D26808B6
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0xE283D72AE7CC3451571424480AA032FE
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xE11B3E0B7271AB9552FE6907A31D642D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0xE3A9966C12B3A6552E9259D63463076F
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0x95B28DE8B90E4380289DD151E6E99877

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x54A9014A3FD99A436BB4231C4F7B7623
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x16193875EC8AA4B37993AB106EAA2B6B
this signify?"
0xF99F0A4CB63B50FBB6BBF4B227AAC957

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0xB0F84C039D8180DB805267E985B428B4
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0x03F93A65457BBDB067B9A7422F915A23
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0xCC5E4FD029D7018B476607BF08899E72
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0xB8EB6B27F0F4EB9A54606AABC914C0D1
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x6A733C8E94974627353F9807A4F0C468
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0xB062FBCEAB0F0F3091CA73FDD2E0CD91
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0xE2D08915676D01A8D9CAACC98F172E00
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x6873246C070CD4D6A04F6532EFDD8FCB
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xD88F897BB84E8007B6AEB959F8A2FDC7
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0xAF7ADDEC970A5EF770835A12CE78E501
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0x1C309DFBCF128ED1174B8A321337B143
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xDB75F897B2E2E5D4634D429E4BD3FE1F
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x381FB53FD00F8173D0929D6AFC78BAED

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0x2791DE51F310532EBEC451304FF15FDF
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x2B6CD9D31CE42D01FE19EA19B46225FA
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0x396B3048B8B449AF94B71638DE7A635E
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0xBDA93F39AD5AB996894E1B58117E7C0F
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x2D2462C9D794B0840484BBC0A9C526C0
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x48E0368EBA0393E9FD2B80A32B215349
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0x7B065613E8A6BE06FF27896445564F3D
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x22C346E1284C367EACD34752FA545921
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x528CFB5FA80404197B7DC23674B809AF
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x80359D47F6B3EE85E07B4FD3FE02E236
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0xB7A3FC7B2BAD48D1F2CBEDE2097204B4
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xD53DA4B67DB819ACDD432AF4A3E5CC00
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0xC969909F794176427E1E39150DDA04D1
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0xD99181ED437F58CAC1EE3215D7132BEC
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0xB17FCF6A341D75218B750C022EFA414D
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0xA391950EECF1736FFFBCCB60888DFDE6
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0x7EDFC8C5D4F9EAE6DDECD7E50D01E017
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0x7B2510F833CFA13F909155FDF58E3810
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0xB031B3AA53219FA74ADCE7535C1D88F9
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0xCF868BE8349A215C525A3C35A9C117FD
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x83C8E6E84DA902F17B2E3BF3DD0DE8F7
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0xEAEFD47CC475570766DCD2EFF2819FDB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well?" he answered icily.
0x9F5AC4F85E04832B2C379D7DF8C357C8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x2FD84E2B1A4ACC6FB77E28156DABBF9D
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xE4EBB63EE7E5B2AF808160EB8547142D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0xD09F810769E125CF137BE2E884E00F71
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0xBF3A5020D68B6194EA6B2939EE73A73D
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0xBF0FF0B9691699BDA33F74E3FDE709BE
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x6DBFC0A5E2151327E0C7635365820BB2
tribes--and unwed?"
0x87363780605942041B1C7FFBBD6484DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0x8BD4CEBC74776F7C59AE6D4EC5A6ECA8
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0xBDBF0CAEBE5C727290364B3AD38A39F3
yourself."
0xCE2D9F68E8A3877DF8CC40E41E85424C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0x65411CD608C9BC31FD5E289E044973EE
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0xCCEFA66153C987C2FED0E61FC3F6C7DA
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x991DCFEF9F4C36EAA68D4382B612E190
heart and--it would not do."
0x17DF08BEC6ECCF9133560B2AB3048BBA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xC20A55522945CF59F40ECAFF9CEC374F
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0xAE32CC51D06A76E36E6610897F92CCEA
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0xDF5327CB51196A206CB79B0290C1E09A
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x9757A21D50825907CC6D3E5659964778
nothing more--don't fear."
0x1E6A018B9C35AFCABB9FF0B3387D6615

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x206EB38B5835BE57F02ACA09028A4C08
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0xBFE05698A8AB76B4562CBE0ABA0D3F2A
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0xA6B767D6C68D25544E7B803B54C0388D
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0xC474D7EA46AF346486ED9CD68DB4040F
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xEEF19200B6922F62CCF3B0E2B9204DE3
eyes."
0x9204CD6C9204CD6CDA0F71F435A5A4F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0xC6BC80765E00B12AB8E8C6F17971E553
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x12A2CA26F4671DF7F91D4592E2E6181F
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
0x0DF5256A5CAD011C079A9C4702108FCD
offer it."
0x4D95772E76806C5F7D96DE9D2D49AD3B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0x4862D9318BDDF47C452CA55AB1547DA9
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0x8F9E9156A070672295A2FBF6F88ED0E2
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0x66F3C5AED0E01D0FEE88744A48F7C338

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x1DFD7349DE5ED03033CF0870C71BDFD3
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x3F5D8F2CC4D0CE45E603ADF867EC2EA2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0xEC410E8C877623265A5F9BDFB24B9335

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0xC6B1F920F312A3BB74B18788B1B732F1
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0x25E3A20A1CEE9F0696F1F1FF00B709B2
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xEC3103725D7744A74F87AED6C9C9ABD6
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0xDAF3ABD0C963955243122D84CE931536
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x1EFC119BA9A531B067F421C49C13D644
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0xF31879EF7F9DFF52E041CC76C785106A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0x6449E906F165E5A4A35D42D75A438EBB
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x651F9E1F27800D3F6196B99E4070D1EF
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0x314731396B9D0F59C90D4FDA08228E37
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xE9DE2B6B64978C72B3E80281A7A8EE7A
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0xCCF0A101565EEC7EEF69D6112F85FF96
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x8898C164B2B00F190555FA0067895B1D
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x491500D7E424CFAA3B32057AC8A20870
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0x4F5E6DA39F41F50E31B41A7AD3369544
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xF9BAF4343CAF012894EDB041F0ADD163
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0xFF2F3098C92979B6927B81E381ECC3F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0xD0133A4A8E8298B8227F838C5F9A46DC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x98AAEEAA581B4C15EF74C4D3EAA4F06C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0xF2C322B024271701062EEA848D1444A0
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0x1964FD827D86FE2690276F177118CC5D
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x2C2529F048FC37DEC9926BC12B14B0F8
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x98FBFCB5120906961C499A9DAC85EF7D
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0x602C33F7A642C08771951EA991A4613B
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xE04E5EB5C24AA1586840EED2E0401BAF
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0xAE974E8B28E107715B6709B2E394ED74
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x8FC59A797DB3D97A16713884675425F3
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xFB9DAE3DDF9BF617DFA63CD6B1EC1FCF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0x93F2172393356A72ADF56E929BA06A20
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0x6DC0658A71CE735C4877783BB58481E6
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x789629702CC28CD3E1CD51B738B6331E
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xBFF77E29AC4E72551D83B5C792EE7417

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x14B7C371F025B4CFEFAEAE03556860CE
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0xB18D1336D7F9160C99860511A66AD0CF
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0xAF8B1AE124446D0D5A7D59D52BDC4E25

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0xB327C4BD3D0E626BEB07E6CA3C5F9888
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xFE4EB7E0FAC8995612FE9E258E8967B8
stairs.
0xBDA55EC9BDA55EC94CF967D421085C63

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x388EA70C24A410DD69159BDE484268E4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0x807A47402155367079B53614470AB263

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then shake hands," I added.
0x2F9F45CA14C9C225CBEB2D6A77329E60

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x599C48B2A15C2DD1001D6327463E0BF7
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0xD1BCCDD98B283A5D56185B17699785B4
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0xC3152167473B0216B2742D7D664B0905
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x854245ACCBE3B548A97F8D64C4CB814F
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xAFF6EE44A21654CB200A20338A242914
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0xD77A5C92AEDA608D0A63CE1C5FB1D0A7
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x8E884FD55C332A67F4AFE92A6AA1EC58

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0xFB53D7BBC9588A22482B346146524309
down.

CHAPTER XXXV
0xB18D6FEB78CB9144C8AF474C5192846A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0x95BE4FDB4EEFB1FAD14BF3F61EE9373E
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x1126B2C46A7552269998040B40799A11
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0x24E2FD5EDDE98FCD7EA791DE97C84CB7
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x3B7D5432228D8627606A448DCD0143F9
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x8D5CCDB4B975DD9D304D292CE6F5163A
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x0EEEB661BAC75B71E0E84D1941C0CB0C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xD7B73BF37AB083365E3CA64CFD0A7480
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0x040EEBC92E2ED9B5556D59AE6068240F
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0x5187D18883C94331D8F2B4DF51DD825D
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0xE805C5AC51DA7E01564174AD596FE22B
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0xFE0E9614E2FE00F9D7D6718FFF1B94CB
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x5474EAD0CB0267D95F4C1E67A6AD08AA
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x0BB642B01B46E09F134A75BD140ED0B4
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x1C6AC65762ADB6A31DBF3C89F6F6ECB6
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x1B31AB7D6BCB01466AF0F28FC21A5567

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x16EB5A62ABBBDC0EAA9E2BA162EB79EE
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x96332104CF5B2247692D796B68A0517C
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0xA8C67C3B1479FD9A0F5B7F777C2BC3AA
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0xC717C81A5A3B1306939F40C3EE097230
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xA466DFAE9EDAED0C5035354073F9D6D6
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x7B0ABDBD362697ABFA2F7F04EFBE1B15
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x0B2D921B95732558EE4DAC681071214A
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0xEB1DD57619ACDE5795A5BBA1DEA9785C
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0xE645A993FE75F3C0690F95005881DE86

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0xCD45B7CCC33A4F055A3225D7F190E4C4
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0x4A1571DB0D27E11465F2C4F49F7A99E9
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0x38CCDD47695BAF9CA76EBCAD3664B88A
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x7CF0152FFE28E6367C8C80EC4C9A010E
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0xC9CC891699724C298D8AABBD0CAC2FA5
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x09BB0F66849A9A435B5F1E8B2910B431
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0xCB75E1DEA6B84D52294D3EFD559B8077
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xEA48956DDB7AAC50C5AC32B3EC8875C3
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x4B96817646EEB895D706D50A296929D5
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x4EE05B50C98661B3B7955EB10D9539F0
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0x46E02ACC3D551482E42FE15AFDDCE83F
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x043B42E441EA2777143DD787F8204A9D
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x34B1F7843F3F3A29C7DA5D421012EC7B
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x25429AA7DAD429AEB5113EBE7AB7D7FF
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x7A9E4F895623A975A30AABAEDBBD73E7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x8FFE19359ABDD095599CDE2E25968CD3
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x82EF1BCB01B864742C71125B34509929
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x22F7745E242D7E24FF8C74764D046413
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x68C48B0ED0C93AED67E7B21EF77DC340
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0x35DC5AF1C2BDDCB98C36B137C80AE10A
spoke to the point at once.
0xAD737B9FE050F0231AE1851FCDD9C481

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0xEFE1E6CCAE7AADE0A63DA0864F114531
friends."
0xEAC6E2780171CB5898350AE60E552BA2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xBB1A96F5602329DA07A55024A4986D7C
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0xCD16CAB4A7DD747572DA8A1559116A0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0x677ADD7F733EAF7DF93D7DCB21B6752B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0xB8462C6FB2110D90696EFACF817F947F
good."
0x421B1C77421B1C7708C60BAF2E0B7433

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x2936B9B03889571F57F7EC842655439E
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of

affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0x01657CFB490B4B4AB071F4F31968587B
strangers."
0x9F4FDB8579BDA0B622CCDAD8651D3938

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x8F23AF65AD650BF6E2067F11AEBAFD53
regarding you as a stranger."
0x329045A5F044D875935279123A8D771D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0xE92D4E463F18C99EA3CCAEA3FC4BB9CD
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0xE7008BC6475E6E3991F23F37FBD9D078
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0xAF776E1F71A8AC9F43E05AB8FBFE1B96
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0xB4CCB98C7ECF1D84E11BF36BA5D62F8A
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0xAC5123C732F7DE89CCA6E67E5FEDE164
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0xE2F91C7163BA81434340BFC56084DB5F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0x9A10F16E48428C6EFC26E3E2744B7C07
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xED57FD26C6CE297CE8ED3E7CB7627DDC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x17BA1C7CFA03EE72C7A7F15C045BBE32

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x958BB3AEF05E282A1988C5F935F86993
India?"
0x0A24F0BA0A24F0BA8495D31A3D4C273B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0x390B1CB6E829CD27F4E39E8EE0F3C365

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x7BE711EB93996CF944B00E4265C72428

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0xA56860CBC7DC674C721A0169F8C8C274
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x90CC37602084D619FD86B2DBC8078738
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0x6F3428AD789F4412A691F41E7FEDC53F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x1BCF39DB1B1FFA90E158612BE13538B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x723A56C27A0A63C7F1459C429B776529
crash down.
0xA9E69FB9F1E775948989B4E66C78D1C6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0xB0556F1E8B27FF78D21520DBF996E61A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x90D1DA472FB3E45AB889B5692EDCFCA7
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0x45CE12E2522278824177A4B78D0C200D
You are killing me now."
0xDFAF1B39FF2A824395FA955526CDC7E5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0xF8CCEFA0D47EA03E04CF1B5BF7B3793B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0x900BAA368D80E37F498925B53F3FA13D
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x5959FA686E4D604C84F471BECC141AB5
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x175A6C9EDA965B5F543D7BC5C79F8F12
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x4E502C86197C66816573A0319F63E227
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xB009519108B469C86DDBC1A0D72300E6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0x49A89EB77C5E15167B813ADF9503249D
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0x9BFB5296883B3CCC2D0D41AE0675EEF4
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x11A3B3DDCBE33FE03B1C29A6F41D31D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xC23C7FBA8645D23DEFDE7772DA995840
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0xA8191B3060CCD0E9548C5AB59BE07BAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0xC3F69A7FDD14F8E9312D24748AF9D71D
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0xDA29A0BAE50EC8797C706B35F9919F87
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x52E4C5195F09068A9964AD97B791DF96

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0x2C387421269A7FDABE0A9A189555B511
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x7B0BF84C5AB7F8DE7F59E9313E6CB593

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0xA31FBA9E96FDB6929A8D074475E975B2
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x0D97870EFF7C755139FD1C63C235A822
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0xD6C417A2058BA33A0012088DBED0DA52

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0x8439EB7D12E6582F038D045CCC74C308

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0xDE419E2AB64E3B181B7478DA560CA170
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0x21D167311DDB00785523340F1554691B
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0x75EFC857ACF0948C4853FE717189B876
spoke at last.
0x631A6F1EFB7292D1E5F088A106C25B94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xC2903A6ADFEF520E96669BDC863AD6B7
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0xDA923B94CEE842DF49D6037FF71ACF00
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0x7DFC84E560501B51E526629EFE64C8E5
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x825CF9FB15FE3FE2031AA30BC8863A5B
sake."
0x8C3FD52C8C3FD52CB17EC0ADB55B0104

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x79709B892EA7A108381D9455AE84AFC5
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0xACA932129D11ADBCFC934748B7A2E179
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0xA822B7029C05DDC427E9D64F6A60CE1E
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0x7B55FBEFA1BB7CE0A694A26B7AB91220
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0xC88E46FADA9FACE24608356FE4FCAA5A
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0x4B3797541EDE367F6664397D0767270D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x6FEB2483872A586E3FF48770AEFAA2C1
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x2948804AF139DBF3639D75036D4D20DD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x9A1EDAA9827A1C9AED66596F3B82127B
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x8D6BFEE65007E11D1B03DF25DDD1584D
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x93FF0B11B075B9148FD193E1823CD635
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0xF43920CE179ADA72BB7E4A06098AB3BC
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x17D97BB8181FAB9AAF87700271C839EF
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0x09F71D43C9614D607AEC251F3911D969

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0xAFF1075EA761DC0FF0E0509C65013B19
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x95B085E49215A3B8A1F25631213BE401
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0x2B7EFB54B0A214E4CA1D2204ABDF227E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x50BE9FBFBF6329487BBD3D3CAECB86B8
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0x8879D3C74B4D0A69F2DB3F7D881190CC
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x9540ED93F75D1F8507E5D43DF9E52BED
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x64B4B272717E25CE64D7470FB0227304
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xE9112A4DAE64097178F686F82BD10C1D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x8BC5F85F20C33A890F46D87DD9DF9B9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0xF348DAE1C758EF5EC8D34FCA40684882
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0x0A892784F14C0E6CBF04A0AB1D57C828
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0x5F0B8700A1E1B03B0985F36FB30B7B6B
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0xC7258ABBE50A384EA46BD9C643E482DA
leaving it."
0x61195953C1301F469353C266A4D50967

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0x4FB3C0E674A4C94B1E346BF2952993FA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x77161EE585899C364D24CEF9ACEF2559
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0x899A3FE538685AA5ED34837A244AEC8E
some means that doubt is removed."
0xE68B74C3E331895B8BEC11F576E0B9FE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0xEE4D511F9A95046FAD05916E6936730F
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0xCCF03BA50A1A5AD27427E85DA0ED03A3
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.

Rochester?"
0x173BEE94283941B4595038CA4C6B7D44

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0xAEF1FAB43B5E442524544499E6F1BC38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x541712280938DB0521826E9372F5E5A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x315F6EA572D2D598684E013920BA9D3A
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0xCC3E36B3B9AC60261871ECC8258A662E
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x6C25B00A51055ECA62BCDF8C4DDE8D90
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0x094EF0940824A045B9D10AF686C5B20D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xB394A64DAA882EE711D16B3D92D16CCB
was soon out of sight.
0x3506433A008A0FFBB8B99AC7D4ACEA51

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xD06DB771EFA684640E57CD7FB519D811
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0xB4C5FD1B6C897C5AC493A0EFCA214298
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x4CE1CABEBCEFDC4CEAA4DC14315E4610

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0x6212B89B82274B3628F32DE0B4B92902
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x54C22A44EC446BD9616CB563359A04E5
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x64DE5C8B6EE92CA6FAA334CAEC50AAD8
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0xBC9D9C29173F28854CFE7F8951E86500
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0xB8F2CFEBDE5EBBB3C8A63E1B0E98439C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xDE85B7981190FA722FD4312A2A2E61F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x685FA01953494DF76F5A5B5D481A5E3E
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0x64114A18A47A5767ED54221B261BFCDF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0x93CD8BF45535852AC9DB64C64A889C6C
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0x0F0E7C3FBCBA000711A157E1040E7D9E
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x3CAA8F8ABF3E6AE72E6982666115AE94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And

you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0x9C9609BD1F2E79BC1DA2D502B830BF22

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x419927AB880D31DF2AAEA2BC9D61B91C
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0xF7166DCD02B6468DE424BAF460A669B3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x293D1EB73F3EF1EBD175A780250F73AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am

certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"

0x4B2007FAB5C3F6CCEA218F3BABE6EACC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x7295889D692933775D3A2BCE705B1DD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him

as his sister."
0x5E4B2A46EB894EEB0076B5DC54D8F9E3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x6C6B2C0D49C3078C2C6D2713680D3F19
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0x8C796FBC110CE5D2F08C002A34A7C3DC
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to

impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0x7010D19987AB1F39065589399F4624A4
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0xCDA2E599D5D83261FE9CDF6B0BFDAA65
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x6BE22C3E3C633DBC3ACA17BD6A57207D
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0x211C3EBB255842FF47A201DEC992D9A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Not as a husband."
0xAE7528A9434A823E9D4B1A7E6FF223DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
0x718909D780C0851F32E869E03F842AAC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
0x2D93487D665E1F61573DE36A9F4D9246

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x088A08DBE5629C9A3F49C1A102758DF4
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xFF7C9A9451A5CA417DDC25110F71FD3D
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0xF4FA392F42A50B3C8A0B47A577DF3FD4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xEA1B57BB4DC3FF510948A71817215039
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0x1AF495658AD811FF439F8772C164AA7F
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0xCB1C0D31EFF41C87C242393351978A9A
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0x7B5DC8ACA1EB5DC7ADF2ABF391377BE5
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
0x0B752A9F88E612A89D6B3A05EE7297F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
0xECFD05214ED5734C04F5E84AB81CF89A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
0x09459134C06129F9DB6A24EAB6740B18
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
0x5445926A1F98ECB1790A5E43E0DB0C84
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
0x2E5C5970049E133A54C1F714C74DFF69
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x4CF983CDEB36D3640BDBF3D667A8A228
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0xC71B8DE8352C31E69469EE2FFCCFF7F3
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0xF58E083A0470FFC5D81EA653196854C7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xE9E8A0A416143025412BCA7F2B0A2363

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x691F9CEC9DB829A4ED1EB70C846DFEBD
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x5CD57B6AC8C47D75B82713786A8700F5
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0x05EC3D4796BC36B2248CB149C8C74DF7
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0xFD865FCA1C5A06BFEE8FE4743D7835D9
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x254735EADE1A95EA985B4853980456C8
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0x8819BC858049D0CC511A74CC6B29F978
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0x8F1125CB0C7E0DCE49C586C9215769A3
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x0A4CBF3DB3E14F1B8F56904586B239B1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0xA739BE3E60B5B439CD23E54908CD55E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x433C2573ADC8A898DB24AC2CD8389DF4
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0xBF6D6768319550B8D7190A23D13E92B1
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0x8535A4F4A65D8BEAAF665D511D7FF91C
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0xDFF8F7B949761545EAC4F9A04CCC8CDB
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0xADC40B5113E510BBDC6C531F9ADF86F1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x39C7E896C99E54E5BB3818727C6F2840
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x97F1053F04E48C39B11BFAE057E1EFE3
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x7DF954E372F45B8A68D607F0C2DC9663
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x9831DB7651A130BFC4197EDF9449244E
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x060FC8DC95E623D9D8BFAE0C43E16735
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xFF62E79F6722DDE7AF42B9482C46514A
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x14417A56E183B8D7352DA24C35B2B5A3
had forgiven me once more.
0x880DCBD60D5B392F7C7CB3CBA040AC85

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0x907B2AD03AEF0AA8123349A1564961E3
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x319CC5C623155BE1D708E3EFA250EAFA
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0x56188DA5F0250B94620385AC30CA886D
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x5F64036100E64BC058BFDE9F5ECA2C28
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x0643D8510FDDDC10B3B4844A5954CF93
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x443BDAA5F925A4A40EBC7AAE56ED7F97
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x32B6AFCFFFDB0AEB042A53AAEDAE608C
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0x8321003BA5340C63F4E955529D850447
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x9899B60AA2F668159DF4E0BDC6DA7A83
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0xAE41AF7A3C6C32275BF20839DDD94450
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x37BBB4360093FAFF0174932014EFA40D
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0xCDA992854FFEC171CF409971238CE477
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0x550DB5FC8670E1832BB5E69A67E3D00C
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0xB2F941F69B6302D7A1E7EF59D0750720

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x024B4B251314159B0A21675193EF0824
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x2307C89F1008C593148B570DD3E6CBC4
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x31CF4BD74C5A6089643476A7B4E38DFF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0x4BEC729EE43AD27CD3261D52F19E2351
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0xCF27C41AB9D908D184BF4F850EB60276
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0x3812C971F20372129CD84DD7819A42D1
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0xA1EC3280F3AF883E27A459EE04D64E54

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0x343A79852574FB69895675D732FA9F12

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xC043E8395CF323541231EAC269DB6246
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0xEBABA02EC617F97E22BDA88C4FB7AF5A
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x752EC2280203BE1C5126A6B74DC75AB5
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0x1024CFFCAD8254D825F931B95EF7426F
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x506DE5BE010A2A0DD20A4221E0953BF9
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x000D7A88F6058508A94F9C46AF221B8C
Lamb is the light thereof.
0x2A01219F23586750C768CF199AD0E3EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x81D1EA6E2789CAD3923C24DC71041B1E
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0xC47F49C16C28359BA0538A508FB7A1EA
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0xC7E1BF8C9F845A25EC4E5A9DAD004663
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x7E77C7BAD32677414905AD706BD3A352
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0xADB27DCA780A97D1EEA8EA8BEA369F3E
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x0BE2D7010ED67899EA7F115B8717B3A4
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x9066053E8C680FCD78D29C5B5C6BC455
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x2FBB270F6271C2E168B97B8DBC7DF033
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x456C76AC4E4AA8FC9F6990FE5CE98E12
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0xC20CE521F1E7200AA0323DA671B2C1A1
could not but feel it too.
0x4741E02C6B0693DFA14AAB5BE54C5AB8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x682D02852F434DF9D826E10DB65EC4F6
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x0BB258969ED1DD28C65FB572913B3AE4
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0x6A1DFAB987CE100A145F9D825EC2269D
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0xF5020BE00B6799EE45066F085FC73714

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x3988CBDA587A50CC7A02C601FE31B4E3
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0xE3B315B1B2EC577B8AD15983FE2005CA
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0xC5A2FA27DEA44FA9A9EBFC43DA2ED1E4
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x3B0824303A3B7937C1A72C7E3F8075A1
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x1251815D7E077B21B4164628EF446AE8
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x527234A8741CB7B223A9758B69C24C4E
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0xE2EC4F7BF71EFAC928BDF4B83127892F
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x939F0601B2ADE42B6D3DA9C4CE38D51F
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x57E038FE4403888D08D1AD0B69E079E9
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0x959EE07EBAC4175626DF0FBE83FF9FC4
from you!"
0xCCDA8D30C4796EDCD99911A7A5FE2248

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x5B51B111CE9A4DC07971929B38325AE7
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0xF000F21AC37A24B2FDEB737F10A05BDA
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0xFEE94DCEF77AD757691DE13D28BEEB43
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0xB6B3F92ADEBF6ACC428769636F272B17
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x9978436E8B7B9DE1CEFF919FDDB29155
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x57C5A747B0BC11B06361F131FF62219B
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xD251EE62B564D6822575BF95315BE0DA
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0xA94350AAFE6C4C1C126BC38DB3D54D7C
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x425DBB4BFA76D725EFFE9478037688AB
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x6BFA8407A958D24CC0F1E742C486F873
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xAFF28556FC0887B49C9EE1906D676971
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0xBD11BA87C3D5DC4A9155AB6BCE72FE28
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0xA07E27A324DA21D964C39959862B3548
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0x591F34074A1B77C435E5668E26ACB758
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0xD08301636DC833E5519BE3AAC07E6EAD
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x91C545DB51A1D664A1FD8FBFB407D426

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0xC54910890E253C10878143885BFDB5E1
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0xB8BBA7F218B292FDCDD1F705152C657C
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x9C913FF8E5138074E6E3C4C7DDA8645E
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0xD6465506236E6A0E0A30C9C3C142DB6F
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x6BF81562D64CB47505D3C6EC3F089139
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0x3BA68DA1D6CFC3E27EFADB76A74B1A88
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x5F7A3CD64316CE863D375805B84DCD2D
dim room was full of visions.
0x7E89817E59F5992E478DDE1CFF3D0FBF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x8C0A4B55F002D06D29D5AA1878525B8A
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0xEC41F41CBD4F06A77B87F0B3F6E379C6
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0xA047D3470F7194DB2C410D2D8EB8F5C7
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xC74F534022D10758CE299BCD7B9A34FF
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x32E3105CF7C3A0F2BA7252429EB0A290
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xCB7372A59A73C7EAE5E3EC55A46D8111
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x824C73075D85080E6E7EACDFBB684674

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0x4B842338AAB3EB9101AA2CE38A9BEF80
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x241EAC5578129D875807EC02BFFBC32D
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xA4784F4CBB65EAE9FEBE1951AAC46DEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x3E0610BA6B184AA8712895AFBE65A480
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x9C07187CBE4CCDDD85FDB98179E7FD29
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x12DD0B450192220C9600A15D2625604A
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x6CDE479F45A0B5616EA4CD737E76C3FD
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0xF912FB3739BE5DBF957CFAF823D757A1
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x4021B37349FDE27DAEECBD6EF9E1DC1D
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x9CDB47E9E0FE69F3B9184B31B9F4B74C
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0xFC73A3DDD2F678E287CCF8FB0C7D507B
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0xEE0AA17B19DC9809BF8DBF38738C7FB4
shall judge.
0x84986B02C99F111FCE27717DC01A255E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x6ADB6C3B4F74B94E3C2DC47C6A341AA0
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0x6B523B9AAD3CB09029DAF4A18EEC69BC
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xAB0E6199F51B5FE92207CAA9E981A2E2
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x243BF4490A65F19AF1991C2EC115CA03
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x2BEF321CB7E74F66015237BB1C9679AF
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x81022D9DD18BD4667F13ECF4FE1AABC6
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x2607F9B55E571BCCE0A065E29E4E9A48
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0xBE9D3C73F780637AA065AB603B1A5E92
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x8A83DBA911CA5A6BCE440379A17E777F
bones.
0xCC0F59CBCC0F59CB5A06E74BDAF4DB6E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0xCC09AE71FE2230278206594BC5DCCA79
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x05F02E514D80BB55943916C505378131

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0xFE4B8B0521363228DEC1DFB60994B871

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xEEEA2B6335821E1B3433977B74688DC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x8077A4C775F02ED2BF365573780AFBAF
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0x0DA6C0C04F11240FDE04FB0C48238577
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x693C281AD4D1050F1C21C1D29B40F19D
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0x1DB562E7F531B21FF207E3BA5742C3BD
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x45A2887A798D46FF806BFBDFF8C1988E
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0x93406E99DD79BC0D024140CD3919C590

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x0CC81CFC78CA57CDAEC5F2001EDAED7E
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0x4D2AE2CF114C55B5ABA6D8ABB7E32A9C
garden: it was void.
0x9A0EAEA78D5BF9C9DF3ADB9BA608554A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x1F9099BAE8FD44323672F05A5C2EF0DE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x926EAFCBB22EC2D45DF17C0009E8B53F
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0xD0076A07D51E10DF64535F827948C8CE
loneliness and midnight hush.
0x6A96A16AE6DBEB07D3482EA5C60D46E8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0x5884AA68718512BF937D94C135C17981
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xB5C2065048ACFBF7645FC98268267502
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0xEC5D54309B4EA55A08D8B619F358B59E
best."
0x8D3D95348D3D9534D730FEEF5579078C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0xB69018464EE12CE6D024F34CC09BB195
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0x39724B0A58D034D87C0D0EC9C212750C
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0xABFA05CC74447552DBAA3C3A6F4EF67B
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0x11395C883B29D5DCA02000A6589D2091
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x8086A1E78E513CA4D7A9811E1C0742F2
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xF0A4009449E0D9ABDF06C434F8A6BD20
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x0E4ECB7413F26DCDE8728A461006E6C2
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x74176F3A40A4EA3CDE4315C959584ECA
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x1FF97BE4F63B75F7C18A14F9802641D7
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0x98387D8A8DE39539688669E6F1667B23

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0x226893752002C2A9A25B8323D41B1F83
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0xF8573EA844085A68183DADC1D230957B
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0xB313C1569A3FB4175C5DE805AB6C2D5B
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x5067930BCB1FBB27530DAA64BE614C31
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xAB170BC2E54F6212DD22C5B413567BC7
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0x27919D80568737CCE1508044F11419AC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x9F156D4B8E851A85C43F34CB84E03906
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0xFB0510ED500F6BDB07B466E8243CA691
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x33DF81E9F7E08E8F07F6916AFA3DF9DB
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x03D18DD27C16F786F5D81504891E8967
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x2546507BC1CAB46EF3CA5501DE0022D2
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0xF7FB6C83A23F5F75523462D1F9D947AA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x1792F25F56D3E5EF4C0918ACAD78D182
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0x569E8504413518871AB0B090A4C70E7B
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xAFDC18ED81B008C323FD702BB32C6D41
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0xDFD58592D6E026E0437B46A02F303BF0
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xADDAF2A490995C26608628CC17CCED6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0x35F3C80BF350E630F96792A528625A93
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0xD0B84B65DBB3D06C935E5D2F805B4068
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x16C2639789BF36542055B84DBB4F0DF8
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0x8A9FC1F118521D362799356D1204073C
would meet the coach.
0xE9C55C8233977A39E2937D08AD751699

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x98A0B0DC8A98061E7316E55ED2605D11
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0xD8D8FA342E62B91C6AE365E25A2593ED
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xD91C07CC41E72358A64AA7CF145F0682

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0xC6354FB23E61361FA811FF07D7D9FED5
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x90B4ED27D1682DCE6ED2581B0A87586A
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x9D38F0391A3D05E9576CC41340118D11
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0x6409E2F2A24D1305A4D32A80989AE8A0
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0x716D6022BF4E02A3F3D48D3DD58B4F7F
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0xB5750994C0CEB7F00CB00057EA9B9148
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x0C87D9C224E260985834021EEAEEE5F9
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x0B6AD35F9A0A5F78C563E5E3C213EC49
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xC83E98506EDEB35D9546FC85A18E0AF2
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0x75ACC3000935FCCBBFD1104A7819AA14
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0x7B3632BE9F17D125E4C6BA67E54662CC
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0xA084C3694EE5AADA26435F7DD0660002
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0x2DCBA50CE205F3DD54FDC85EAC428C0C
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x133223D5D88E1991AB9BA0DBCE522C3B
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x7284D70C72769E02C47FC81D5DD14C82
body.
0xB0DCCC71B0DCCC712CF7ACF7224806A7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0xD8750D874F2E17932724A296E7EABE12
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0xCB4B20973ADDD33820FFC00014D52F13
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x62AD15591785E85C5BAF6535E3E90BAD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x76D019B010C711840342E38EF3818F01
and should be absent at least four days.
0x76C0EBA10518011713A22FC696449CEA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x4F7042C28F4E110A59710AE25322A841

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0xC4FE5A2582A42940C228E5BAC5849BEC
time been uneasy."
0x0833252DCBA138DDBAC1A7B44F40ADE5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0xEC626D75FFF04E4095D7A1EF89312B0B
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x97D45631170EBBB42B048B93A3377589
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x69DD6E5FA4B564B4BAABE36297D1F344
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0xA853AA2DB624720B3A51AC8609757A79
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x585DBF55AA84BB01EB7579574870A72F
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0x2DD481BBD55F8268D836F952D990830B

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0x21A846A6ACD4D4834112242933F76D7C
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x465342599AF8E8F166528153DD12C1EC
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0xAFFCD344E1ACEA1B04B62307A3246F10
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x9CA3659706FFFF27A12029A902D4A129
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x1D7A219449F1951A0FD612A226116931

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0xC0DCBA32BF9E5002FB2CC5F9D15984E1
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0xB9EE8AD3FEF856BEA875AFAB7D493E8E
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x799DB1A66FFFBD5979ECAA80F6E7F442
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x66E62C292DD42CDF471BB7AB131989D8
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xFB6270CCD2C7A189837360E7724FCABE
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0xC37A7E87BF1CC5D5011C2E5C27244ACF
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x55C5136D1F43C25BC0B38D2B5E70907D
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0x5F5439078FA56B06B22C1974DA0C290F
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0x3E363BE4CDCFA814666D755C79E03763

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xB7F5245ED4122F9E6FC32F4F5B677EAE
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x1D299E9583A64D996BE40CCEDD72E309
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0xFA1219AD7251F96AD48C26C04D3BA5A4
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x9A06620A97CE6D5162F2F45870FDC59F
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xB1DAD2109F9D2A96E45E418AF7E363A3
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0xB4736F2595FE04A9667530D0493A5CFD
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0x6430795FB107E8FA7D7EEF6CFB3BBAE1
we were near my bourne.
0x4F83EB0DA64BBF8F1EA4C227FE979121

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xB80FF0C48C67866115B065E5117ECA4C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0xB2AFCFBF37B9D71705B8915F1A70CB38

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0x9B78E2D6C929E9E36A2B44FB457C53EA
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x8B5A26C63C60B32B5C92B4F606C47241
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0x2F04DF66862BD2EABF763CEA2479027E
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0xAA627D6C014E8229DD8733B804547F1D
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x03C59AC49BA597D42ABCF83AA011468A
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0x93BA3BD1EB30ED128854ECE321F9DE01

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x2A6F0E247686B85F4018E798400A2C0C
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0xE1787F2E57DFD366EFE1AFF8D5599BF8
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0xA5C423FA68B57C02BF73546CDA76F05F
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0x923BE1F0DCA77143B11749CE0BF17C39
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x3065334EB34CF750713E8D450BD056FA
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0xA08F84BA396FFD472D45D6AEF54016EA
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x119FA12BD3F5C8EC2C793643177ADAF2
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x6332C4FC0145C7DD0993456AED9F2D0F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0xA3C2C07D0D6401A8575299FE7424A2F5
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xE40AD1F76FE726C1073C7EA302F3E6CB
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x2C34D9F2658651F6B55259673B0C2B66
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xCFCFD00726EB04BAB7F799D47E33EC37
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x7905F2CDCC12D7831DC95C7A9D3F72ED
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0x35FE385C7A21BEA81B11666ED71655E3
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x71E93AC058D87764283F6087C30CA1FF
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x37893742E5335748E74E834AB625A403
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x5343A3E7C81EF94738A70B73169988EA
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x6C5293331B9AFF5E2D7EF49300C5D5C2
them!
0xF19DE05AF19DE05AE2B91B39E9392F31

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0xEEFD81050CB14BD4236DEE38696C3F6D
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0xFD9787E19A7CB5B56963A6F89901D8CF
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0xD85ADEDCCE6A967714CEC3A61F540A19
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x5F8C447841E0A579FD9D02638508396B
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0x84066B97BB6A8E9F687E556B69E98C9A
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0xD8600033EE8B1599439B3AFC9F018D9B
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x96F8481CD474E9138194B665F10D556A
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0x2A2396E1396BF1096FBAD65F2CCB9B4B
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x10E3924787EED3382640ECA2CF22DED2
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0xE61215D074F802F09B179AB3092F5D3F
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x4A95DA8059E798C839AE3424C0650A59
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0xFC72B19CBA10E6D985091FF7F04537C1
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
0x2D33DD409B9BB948DEE3187D072FA8E6
tideless sea of the south."
0x30B24A2C141B968408CB47A1AFFBEF99

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0xBC9E02987D54F8F7E81110DBC6DEC034
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x74004668ED3F96A89887F18FF4F60D1F
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0x817B9154CAD21A1968B8A6FF35805B93
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0x329D35DDA5532253196044B56DB14CD3
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0x4D5096A9137B6ADEE4C5AD627D41CB36
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x9188D0C06C9B11EEF656CA8E4BB837C1
station were at my command.
0x0E96ADCE1950C39229042FF99DD13C28

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0x9926139413E91D380C438DFF057679F3
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x09AACA4C3C48D5D439E369CCB6099C68
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x07E40FC30333713D7B03252CFAB11DA5
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x871B45BEE0C5B74BDFF824D7F3512225
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x04C4932B8490A81842AF0760CB92EDBA
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0x8C8425DA03208EA0475CAE3B8DD6F1E2
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0xA66EECB63EA182053307BB0D8E7B0DC7
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0xEB69F4071F6D542F64D663AF06FB8E0E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Hear an illustration, reader.
0x84A2D8A9ACFC6CABF261C728364748B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x44898C8DFDDA2F5B0622496E306EFF4C
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xC3F9ADD202D5BCC3E8A354F8C66B61B8
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0xD6E4FD8F9A9D092F0CF4F559340F955C
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0x03AC4B87D635BDB51881A672838D8849
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0x83D25179A3EEF43A9880D1026BAA31B6
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x8CD5DC8A5A9A2536C56D76C5BF68CE16
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0xC93ACF165A3DB30D586A56C445620548
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0xC5273B509A6EB7C099833831D153728D
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0xB04956C2E8E38F28A88AA62D4E29D075
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x4F09A919337C4A5EBAC0728E9F8D827C
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x57E1CFC1BF41EC170EDA774A4E4CFACB
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0x1961D82D22423C40319E7B8477DAF383
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x34494B701F05ED054D7799178EBBC829

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0x337F9FE085A726624555CAA8E26D0EA8
ruin.
0x4C1768F14C1768F133AD408DFC871CD4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0x2384B8D2F69681AA62497644D79EDFD7
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x398D1C54243CA9AE8FF49F087ED19B0D
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x93369DDE4E510088BE57D05FD4CF2C0F
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0xDCE4436C91022D4F6EAB8C6F8A6163A3
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0xB09C4947D92CA007908720FFC4658BDB
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0x32B989F793D91502B787E755D98E6B52
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0xAC422716CFE7968D1319AF3C1042FCD7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x9F0F7126D3FBE972931CBE01C520EED4
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0x6061C0552CB2B3584FEE7D2F61AF38DE
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xDF1FA63AF0A1AA6E85ECA6E993CE615E
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x1A1043F909824D1CA063D5AFCE9EF8FA
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xE568EACAEE8E97476D9CCBD204A8A010
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0x3DAAAACBBA3F70C5306DD618EE7DB932
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x79530630F26E4AF3E7D38E954E461C92
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x5BAB61006C65B2A3BAE5E4E03B7AA63C
token.
0x09F81DAF09F81DAFDF24B57AFC618676

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x79DF15D9150CF0E1065C1A6F0BC56CF4
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x1C8CAECCA6B40B32455D591B5ACE504C
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0xE491DF6AED03BEBA3AAA74FEC962946F
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0x22E9497C76EBC957BE6C2F67C8AD6309
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x604975588C1CDD72BCA44922452F6E64
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0x33860330D3542DB1D93A70C4B70EBF2C
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x21C2BB612D17687E3C6531D27E7DCAF5
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0xC07A0455DCD70665B6F08E7A26A8698B
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0xD663E79F14AF9947706869CFAE04B4EF
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x9FA6A22D06EC9FA925A1FD0FC4942CE1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0x549B8E06292CC6F27A09244440ED50E9
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x5017877DB7D1F43C2F5AB68D6DBAD42D
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0xC6FBBA3FABA5F3E3DAA6158501545C46
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0xCC57F369304893398FE922B02B96D787
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0x0FFE4B7AE83B951B8556A81633B7078C
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x61D08BA9BEAF3700F0BB06EBC29003B5
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0xA08B915EA7FBD2F5011C29F67FD6286D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x7CD72937147CBDB8BF826107ED1952A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0xBF35B21641A81F0FC96C3840916410E7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0xE802C42B8727397756682480AF9B4664

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xDF431CEF6C307B4708B3447F1010F785

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x7ED13DEF809B101F018E0B50F7A638E9
trying to evade.
0x7973AAB76042AB248DEA5F3A89388AEC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x999FBE2DCBA82B7CB4FDF5FAA1002140

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xBBA96F938F18ED8FC2849DCCB37DD272
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x7D36D72936AF2BEF3137E60DF80173D1
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0x45EC65ECCB725D1A9E0DCE3168A8E4C3
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0x7A28BF1126B4C8CABC87096754CA5EDE
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0xD5BDD04B2E47AD1B451825B624388DA5
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0x34005ACBABC52B18F612F620F84E8FF2
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x58364FC71488B5042F2D5CF635BA7EA5
Antipodes.
0x862DA3BCE09A872910646C7B49D916BE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x48337DF60C83060766B4414A8DE56902
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x4090763265F55011C6435E3ECF956908
direct question as to where he really was.
0x1927FE9951FF2A7BBFA04B4FA620C233

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x93C0B637CF32D213A251824014E99C5F
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0x4DFEF0C03F33FDCB003FD830420257CD
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0x83F594BB953606F0AC757B0845D942FA
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xA7AD3A5DFFB62BE76847FB3356562A97
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0x5A5A313068F0EB4B3CC3645D2A51F296
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0xE90029F1FD5651C2B5BB722A58E20E01
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0x6A06FFCA55582021B5C522F297ECCAAC
witnessed it myself."
0xADC8E672057EF7B29D88A324E61F722C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0xDF89B8EBCD7EFD1BB43A3D1ADF6C207E
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x660A6A9B22FE10B51DF5263116CBC367

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0xD7CEA002CC039985CE397DF0F5F4C9C2
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0xEE22C285256069287F5B5EA83754D047
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x18D7413B5C569AA1C1FDC8136633E8EC
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0xF06762558A678C2CBFEB059BE23126F2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I have heard something of it."
0x3C211B03680E0A4046B055DE6EB5BA5E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0x43F99C26257140E240D89503FA9D7983
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0x6D93FBF2ADED754A6431AAFAE17D12F4
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x77815765DF424CC0EF68E69D9EC1757C
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x632E9FE9611A82567C3F6FD2BFD69545
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0xE40E0F84D985004D221A687D2EEB19E5
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xAB464596FFFC093C8028EA70AAB5785D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0xD2D6E3A86F5E0742244BA7E73EB287DE
main fact.
0x1E1AA5155C82B6D50FC9435053EE2F9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And this lady?"
0x1A04EDBF51BE73C56B3D801A1051C041

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xA7B7EAC9A458768EEBF084E8B5134879
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xC236903CE0F0264C6948786813955AA9
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0x7E9E3CF19FCE349A3F0220BA6D1C4CB5

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x14265004BB13F99129228B2B86E4E445

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x36CADFFB02CEC4DBBE03842DDAB3A5FB
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0x6BE625ABF5BF118008D24806B5F87AB4
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0x941958CE23A6AD118F2CF40F9B0DC4C0
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0x42B4F8EACAFBC48A147B7AEEEC0DF52D
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0xD2236BD0054A7C26DDBAE4A6C18E1E7D
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0xB859DBC8A8A82B9FB02FA8FCEA3D45C5
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x1D89C5C306CB5260984E7D48BFD51C07
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x002F27A752DBEEFEA6ACAA1967FDB981
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xDD0A4D2C1282825B869100AF2B844202
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0x1CA64E39147890EB0575724FD322F8B0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0x6A1C1862C30650297A77EBF0541D2F75
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0x85E77FF6C187F59480F7B7FC5434381E
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0x9BC6D7EBC6E88E1C65654282A7DB5E2E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0xD7B2E1D582AC2745BE7723DA7416F79E
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x7234A80E9935D2C95AB8408674E7E713
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xD66BB8571CFEB9E0EDA7A9EBC349F281
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x105131BC7592CC1EB36EF0DE29AC896C
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0x6FF33FFBD4FEEE156C78671DC2289DA5
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x1F7D327A0BD41FF13429EF10BAFD42C0
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x703D2CC1BADB89CDB4DF4DADADE66CB8
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x55BB9C2A963BE472B6FCB2B9FAC5F63A
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x4BD98BEAA177305F81EDD91BD8CF50E4
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0xB148D4D58E9016D91185815AA39C65F8
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0x7C7A19F0CB8F9D68FEBE8C6B7D41CC6B
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xCDBFC369818FCD2A043A65284DB9EBAC
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0x830786D0AF14B63643F643C020D5F181
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0x7DCB08385484ACC19B48C3A163CEDDDE
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x0FCADC52F3B8888C882AB2471102C6E4
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0xBF6C307F92BF7059D17B9B5A56BCE4B4
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0xBB4D1BA6EAD01045E838E1440D57FCD2
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x2831B14CB64F274FA896DAE0BF0C226D
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0xFAEC0FBDC9FC25A40330F0771B921C48
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x0EF908B2D43A888712D1FE978350F88E
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0x780356B1180F8EC59069A36BDC01FFFE
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x60797048F57BEE89E6FEC8B27861C6DC
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0xB478D02975500DD8583B78CEB52A0B48
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x9071C18C91BC293DAFF98D8DD5A9F79E
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xEA9E50BD82335327BBDED7D8FC4D3959
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xAEFB14731E990BAA74BDCE3ABFFD3D88

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What! did he not leave England?"
0x1CBE4C6CB53934270993AD8412AFC2A6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0x0FDA57577E5D7725EC1764CDB443F89D
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xB433E5FF396A2466732D19036DED8716
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0xADDCD0D95534E983187321C2D4FA51C9
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x2103BF9C39940893B11541DD77A1B172
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0xA9DA3811B82EDB07F95110CA7A502437
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x9E3976AF71DAA7A3D98403AC99DAA2DF
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x5B5D7411F2CDC79E22F91E7A8474E7D3
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0x8D663F5D4BB27109104114C58C1A455C
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xA454F6EFFF8CAFCA91FC88EE7D1F26B9
Thornfield Hall."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
0xD3475EC94490C8573932DE95D144D9E0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0x6337A767E375242A8ACF5FE6C33B51D8
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0x01325361C1FCA2D1A89B48CB19CC8418
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0x689C24C0AEA6F0BE8A558909630491D7
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0xA6821775B7714AE60C6952E0D5791701
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x5E510F01EB438F484343D2863CBCD4E5
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x9F210B18486B76DA02FE5393CE1D6151
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x99C4420D7E8153D0159C78DCF33FF155
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x04C5EAC7C648C9531D5CF1087F9312F0
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0x3525257B2A6089D1A07EFD447CC95DDD
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0x8546358C8AED40DE01AD1AE8E33F4071
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
0x7A7FC87196C95BF8ECA6948EDB0F352E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.

Edward."
0x9DAE76A7014DC31152EA2883856D31CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0xCF9DEAF79214576B3E594D2385E65EC9
ask what had caused this calamity.
0xC57DBA4A31A5C5853AEB93811430CE75

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x9814E4E666635A5D7C3DBC411C1387E6
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0xB477C87D8C8852E1F0E75340440D9B5F
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x71260B9824ED7240C9D2C74D5057A299
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0x5FD0B8EB01F2C6FA16DCD4C89F39FB7B
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x2B9D13F53C2BEB12A2C32E3A49F4A1E3
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0xC29BC042FD6964348DC7A593E076304F
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x24F4F86D85F70854ED563E73B610ED1E
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that

also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."

CHAPTER XXXVII
0x8E44575B6E0D5709A0ED82086B64215E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x85E46E8E296C6C93A3674FE441395E04
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0x9BE60E1AEA087AC2DBF4B71748409E33
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x1B4A748F43F3FDED7DD06D14488FD88A
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x07D87516AB6663B6C321B982D569C445
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0xEA81BF9F49545EAA9FAF1AC088AA4008
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0x17A8930F6B00B942CA822F98BF617278
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x8193A68057CAB48A8C5C227056FDB70A
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0xA39C2FCAFA0EED992D9728FB1EC17C35
there in the season to shoot.
0x012D090E4DC376045C5B251D17DF60C9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x7F8BE009A72338B062F0E5015A15557E
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0x2516BE91C1BEF3992FCB7809C53615B9
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0x86D2B2CB89C6AF8E312E8C0EA65DD7C5
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0xD111CE6AB72EDC7585807865EF536945
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0xDFE7FCEE6E511445C056C6FCB511C16F
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0xC8ECC6766111999389ECDF041F5ABD5A
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0x0D592F16EB21F878A91B0E95C3E08EF6
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0x1DFFEBFC95ABC6460EF06E4EB28ED8B3
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x181F6950342AA5F48F6193E16BD80B8D
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0xD5103935F75A155A5F6BB0297C0441C8
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0x8D8BF8DE490CAAFBAC99403C5A003BBA
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0x38FB2CC1980370DA9755B88F9321BFC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x16DFD677BCC2FAE6D71796F8DC84224C
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0xF27D99D97275AFB2F39F6FCA8C4653BC
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0x97CFB20737C268B77112D81F5387D18B
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x2B725331798C3A21801AB9F1DEEF9B05

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0xC6FEC5E57DA6E81388C7218E9308CB24
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0xD7F62A304D9BFD16D2E4D598438763DF
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x677EC6E6AB2CDFB50EB25BBD6A955B9C
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x80C1FBE1DD0853DC918DB115FAE7A6D8
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x7FB66FDB8317B3B8C466EF265C51A6C5
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0xA84CA34ABB6B61F25D509A8293CE93C3
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0x6B45998E0E2253A9E3501F0A736D6C3D
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x01F3A0EC8B456C3FE30538BAE89E19D2
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0xA90469219A1E66FF113E1D033523F66B
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x09F795A6D23DE12023F5E9E0697AA44A
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0x520EC65F58C2A9B77584E92BD31831A6
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0xB0C2562B56ED57229996AEC90AC8E3AB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xFD5C5A6E1BC68A8AC5111676467C788A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x59F3F5CBA513A41F3572835ED35BDD06
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xAC918377A9497102DD20F3328A11339A
grange.
0x36AF4DAD36AF4DAD6D636F96CC6F7D7A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xAEBB3F4027746C8B59DE0A7918B6F253
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0x43750D4234746D8B328BC301B97C2759
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0xE118F070C0634D0200FF0D2877076621
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0xFAC30548BFF54D4A5EE410B735192CC7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0x99EE37706D44E50B45B5CDFC0D59AA86
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x2CA5DB7527606262DA59DE746463B102
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0x6EF55D56A3F79121954E8770150D3452
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0x9C87C74F5286D375694B2FC362CA553C
advance.
0x1D3F6B22B86EB6BE3E597D16F0559D19

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xF783F9F81EFB11343BBF2FCC86C27EE3
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0xA2A317BF4969EE4060BA6451EED58D36
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0xABABDE668A7B09BD03007CF3A5FBAFA5
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x66C9B741184FFD10A7F6E42CB58E7B44
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x639DBA5DC359235439E8C1101A4B9604
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0xBC952B27F87D3FD31FDCAD820F452E8B
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x1650F88B2DD8733EB88210793920BBDB
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x26C8B4B14D415FB0CB9F92234DB35C94

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x464E307ED4E85B683ADD461CD0692C11
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x181E09FDB636CF4FF9D8030C89DAE30B
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0xE29AC16D054F26CB72F95836BFB77A9A
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x392FFC5D9208494A4E75901EAAEC83B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0x06F4FB0D71F1260887B499C9ED684814
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x11028431A17E86B50276C8C1618A1B6D
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0x37FFCC37CB8D0D5DC5C2C4F1E49AB38B
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0x0742D375EAE7A6C116E33A2FA7A3B9E7
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x1F1D1C134BA4EA9DADAAA035889F39DB
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x0CAB2FE9A693D6B31C19457826262908
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0xD4F69FF065760D7F3B15ED8BBE0419E6
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x9B41DE0F38D1C7562934AA6887B207B1
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0xF8B0839BB0786E7EBFD7312103988BC6
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0xD49E5C2ACB8F06B5B8B014067B8BCB11
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0xB323E82836AA9FC24B7F7BA4C8D55C41

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0x5B02662339753B7EE99F479503A82CDD
had you not better go in?"
0xB5FEA78FFCE71CF8E86CB89454F76F8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x7CABCC093C0769F8C4875BB19ED78A09

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0x73436DA0197249F93EBBE7C2709C6796
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xFD0E719DBF48BEC2EA3F6E27918A6962
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0x5CCB3060911A3F30CA3A1E8B3E407464

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0xCCF06304932CEDE62E893945D4A34BE8
"how are you?"
0x85C74A24FF158F0BAE802248D58AAFA0

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0xEA3EBDFBDA6BC32DAEDE0CE1B38998C4
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0xBDE812F7EC0C9A89DF8EC0A16D2C7181
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x1DE7075F105301C14B102EDF907BF907
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x9C94A13DA9C0B31754BDF2E6AEC1A494
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x4A8BCDC0F411DE5CB951C2CB113B5CC4
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0xA05E96FA03FCAF412EB11A0EF27B490D
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x365BAD5BC356D61448D82754DCDBA2FC
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x7D95C118E162ED57F1084D617F15D596
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0xCED497D2145B2F3A7CE978FDECFD17C6
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0xCFE72916FC2FC0F5E30D8C7C1E2DAB3D
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0x4500C4EF960472322318395B8A5A465F
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0xC9A492CA0B2E41524219C060E583B8C3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0xD38D75976B1FCA3ED1D9BC5C70F2CC83
to him, but do not give my name."
0x7A69DBE4C454B4662609919DB2650E5F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0xA277DE1AB25148031752D77F0B24708C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x20BA9A1A2FAA9504FD129A7302E8379A
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x5A7980F02B887FAF18BC323057A95E03
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0xB896029BE48E39E31202F10035C6EACA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0xCFE9819A3D3C88055ACF030C585C85BF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x83345157019F4CC641584A5057DF2520

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xA841869FED9B8E180C3D2EF42628685D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x46B8FCAB2DC735CB65833FD98E9B3F75
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0xE04F6EB9C541DD0EAE0E1DD3821DD2E1
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0x31FF022A6DC69E4BD4772930BDEC8943

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x729CA193D056B5C6AD347B36A1971D32
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0x01C67D90ED2DD13F1F3E74D2970EA2DD
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x974614ECF1BDD24C1DFE6A49DBC44BE2
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0xD69FA437B36321C6873DAD528C893315
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0x3F0F8C29C2177D0B0F8FBF21EFF1ED47
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0xE68498A386DE3FEFF997A55B1A28CE70
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0xE9E7382ACE07D292DD4CB32B507601C8
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0xE63852BED6B9E57309051A49DD9FDA26
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0xD48EEE48635C891E9A45482DC6261D9B
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x49EA6411508862CF89440314F88DF9A3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0xC4B3CFE2D708D17147D111FE62336917

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0xAB088D91BB8ADF2D466D47492AEE5B30
still excited.
0x8172566A52F2FD874B348E5B5463B896

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0x1F6C3948D304CA14F0BE4B9AB421F005

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x611D84C293DAE06418D5C2213C78D02C
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x256E3FA37D8173D10324467CF87A1E66
you, Mary, is it not?"
0xDA734A026A25FB92E9103AC1AAA36FF9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0x2377582979A4AF9F9AA4036D8701F1F3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0x314A530EB661EE1169706523EA7DDECC
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0xECB7115BC4EB24AA8DDA5BC3EFBC7AB8
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0x989CFB32DE72993B0C367763831C378C
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x78BD3B14E82798BDA73D72958C6A5C7E
and aloud.
0x3267044FBDEFDC73B89CA6D947AAA9B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x2B6E8103B52D7FD67120F4070F53912B
glass," I said.
0x843752E206E8CE5F547C279C4CDC618A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0x90D2C4A8CBB811582CD3822042652AE2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0xC50F85EA643C406E987765EFD802E361
evening," I answered.
0x2BA72A599AB3A9719C6FA78E057C797E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0xD0D160BFDF8DA386E7A804DE88C4D4F6
seized me?"
0x9D81362C947D8AB114256FAFBCA6032D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0xA91CB81B059D8012457434DF7DED55AE
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x27559AA16DBC12BD3D84CD85F7001CE3

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0x61DD0D7A2B95CCBAB517D02E3543DDDD
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0xAFB3B491CE2FE58930F7BBCA62147CCA
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x2D804085BF26F4B89463AB9F88DC4E35

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0xA55C54DA85B1E7DFE6E494652C4B8908

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0x97E6B0F82EC6D6EFDC2FA762ED181EEC
must be more of her."
0x52823DED8E44D2E9703753B634DC71D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0x567819C5E10AE5107EC91CA6775A0B65
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x700CCEE92CF6B8B2DD564EF81FCAF41E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0xE968B80E3956626034E027D8226D47D1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0xC9A1A97E58ADDD93D2B3F99ED3D7572D
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x8E93934FAF0D93786EB7EF002DC4A670

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0xD5C960696542753FD5DD08C58FE9D6A9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0xB05235D65034CAE030A241F073493C32
come back to you."
0xCA4D89FC076E94CB1A116E30B71DDA02

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
0x9C07F63CF9821CCB9C058991C87041CE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x88B6433349F9B268D144588200EC8847
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x6DC09D0E27FB446E77D50353B194F450

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0x6DD8E58F9E55D018AF31D61C1606EBC0
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0x75B5C6AAB3401022A6EEE06EAE2C6CC9
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0x7A92589B61D63B0A232FF2D7CA070DD2
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0xB4BFBE18CC9A740DF3AAFB2BA55421DA
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0x31784FF70CC8BFC9A2A06DEC37A904F8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0xF50B2ACE8E2978662A55D39508ADDFAA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0x41250E5ED80DFA798C9D6A9347A852B7
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0x8AB491784D9E6A1AA7CA70EB33C87C89
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x0869A356E90DCDDE08E803A2B9EB5F27
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0x98B1D41A9FF7A29FF2CA8016F3C58844
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x5C6419E346CCE7DAD87FBAFBA2BE06F3
you go--embrace me, Jane."
0xAE1338D59A178E6FEB8B22737EBB99F6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There, sir--and there!"'
0x0EE710D6E8DBE5BC43A7814B41577600

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x39339E617344DC8CB2E6AA4B9CC7BA33
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0x2678907984300861BEF45FCE64768045
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0xC45DD1DCAD204753AC5A840718BFF3D7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
0xC8DD84042F430EE5DFF403C847D5CE45

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."

that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
0x2CD953D0F3A900DF46AACB88FD11B12A
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0xFD94940A210C08F58BC4A2F0AAFF046A
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,

your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read

to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0xF0BAAE6462D21B7A531E3C7E9CE66F80
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not

He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0xEE819A54873F1BE1A6E2F35101C0AED0
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0x0833692B493701BB6DBE946E3684B75A
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xEE3B7F371C3976C743793D94E62C3BD4
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0xD552B7E42D48773E6902AFE8DAB1E9B2
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x6DE93FEA3A72A81610CDCD11FB19F8AE
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0x1AC3114F053E6B32914A781FFB45A081
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x8E20B329356928B655C695056655C4E1
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0x4666E61DAD61532262F05BDF77E4C0DC
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0x00261F5F5EAD632238C02C2D8CDE796D
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0xBBEDBDFAE94971F9E4F361B4F5A1BD7D
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.

"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0xB63F30C1CDAA717E4F68D593D15374FB
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x549A0606FD40623EEC11BE33655EA490
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0xC64A45DE13462CBC0AA39CD8ABBF3A3C

0x410724EAC22ED7F071183265B0128A9A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x6DD9FC4F37F0E76C0B33FF42ABB8EBEC
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0x720A9EEDDACBBACEACA154723571BE99
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0xEB59E2B45E8A6BCCEABC4E0752F55A3A
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x90EBD571922DDA1C33AC31E996397ABD
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I

you think it better."

He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0xCD96A555276D179CC353327F3B37526B
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0xAC6228684E9D839BFCC07EC23C3736DA
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0x856C0D8A36343468E51EA0E37EE4EE5F
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0xEFD43EE60260D12CE1572EA9DD680C01
conversation.
0xA98402C3A0BB3AB5BCD2DD10A1DC1632

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0x470002FE31B2AFC051C52AB4C994759D
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0xD3E7ED5FE03EB4D2624F0D48C2946341
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0xE297047E1EA7A27FC0B82D02E8D5FDA7
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xFE84315975C5A0DE0D3E265C7CE2DD2A
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x7AA99F9F2C59F887D0D75D33407EF5C8
not yet noticed."

"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x776EFA2A1A824C746275EE4517F9693B
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xAB2C5FDD05D3EFB15CE9235FA8CDB734
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x548A87B6591CCE2CC23245AFDA148CFD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0x77EE31D1110BAF06471DADE4117BF191
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0x69E66CC9214B19F2D33F22DC26AF9668
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

cicatrised visage."
0x64E680BE484A6DE6996F953440FE0DE9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to

your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0x221F653D911FF01FF3CAD339BA57546E

0x0F51A0CEE699CB23AC5A4201C5FC1081

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0x41233762C7EF58D62470C16F7A2508AE
only you forget."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0x34F78C37B434C4CC58F39E00A9B57551
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0x9F6A4CABF9DBC3FE60D6A20DA37A5980
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0xA883DCD91C64CC86D72E06A03C549884
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0x1469036BE40759F1B75EED838E693023
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0xCF2069FB2FA655C1F9EA6ED4E537D20B
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x4AE13E152ADDD2FF7B1DDAFAD8916DDD
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0x06352D0E6508353203C3C9E85461FFAE
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x9C95531375DD2AE74EA588D22E6DFABE
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0x0DBDE743B2ED6E2F9856672C46319FB8
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xF529D0526B18F8DF0C37A4504E76B9B9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0xA0F64595A5541FEC36C8F75491A14971
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x1BFEF4212190BEDE67993202994EC9B7
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0xE476EEB0098F1C9A7BFB8542470C9C14
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x3CF3664F2D8013819DE36FE3FB156CB4
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0xEBF1D748D8CD39802D13BED3D7909B6B
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xD554E5605A438107ACD2DCC4D026809C
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."

my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a

hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting

months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0xF79D68703798C93970B812C7074CB51C
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0xC5A5A6A1D03F2B71E227DE8964B702BD
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very

delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0x3F1E8CB1FE21DCF419731A645CD8D15A
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x9DE8A4775E2763B0D0C332F100CAA846
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x2D8792933A79441EC0E8CEECA82D425C

A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0xF97E6079BACBB83281AFEE9B341CFE89
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0x02F1DA65CA71FE5F723FE6950741DFEA
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0x9C4F50D4E87C25BB5561A56C43C3CCCD
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make

them grow as broad and black as ever.

substantiality."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
0xAF46F9BBABF95E272CAE92F37F58B0C4
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
0x82A67CD07E039B4E7171D9B2C7D7BCC3
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
0xC6472E6A595CBC696EB6F53A2EF2E5D1
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
0x5E28DB6564FB685182FB4DC14B06F1F1
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
0x870B53990C5DEE16C9C169001F561B0C
ham."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
0x57077F3E14E4F656D11D609631393EB1
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his

David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
0x6F37BD4FB62483B7371485BD9522D4A1
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
0x751A91D49FD20EC3257F2CF9FC1CFCD3
night."
0x0EBCD2750EBCD275B2AA61276A27D7CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
0x61000839D6ABBB4E9160FAD3084AB3E6
been?"
0x1C51A7851C51A785F15542E72284AEDA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x3BAD77093690EF217938E8B847674E71
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x18C83F24D7C7B67EE86CDD8613FAEEBF
of his melancholy for some time to come."
0x057056144AFC2E31880E90AFD1A1ABAE

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0xD9CDB2AB094427C3DC6259646637A691
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0xEBB24E4306F30A8FC21772FB43A89187
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0x65894DDE23CDBCB6D37A67F286F4E624
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
0x33FA333FE0A1E0FA5B00E9585C6E198E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x5493D2CABA91C92518F690F2F3882783
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x9422FF6B3212EC5658BC1BD06300B93C
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0xCE3C2A349044551AF8069ABA77C30F19
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x12C9703B1A5D0F46D36696CCBFDC60A7
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x23072B5C4096762BA51C9571D7A39B94
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0xAC287431F46F304AF78763942FF7CDC3
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0xB33C0CF7430FD37EB1B509865F00B36E
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x2FC77E370BFF81BDED6DD0C98EEC5328
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0x8FF5F869FA29101487888D85D882B006
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x9476F0E0B93DB13DA7C83D6A406E3873
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0xB89BDA127570D0792D352F473CFB1F96

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0x1E8EC05942C17723C82150AFDB7A09D9
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0xF6BD2F0AE641B7FE6DEC9CB6730C2401
soon."
0xD835543FD835543FDDB18EA4449F1BA2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x42FC3DD3BCA6CFAFC2B340B9F761CCE7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x10758442F609324B71410C547394374B
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0x1713EC7F1B2A1087D95CC7BFCC5D10ED
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x64DF10C920D27BD0B89616DB066A6F25
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0xB794FF39DA3EF6F92CC80781AFBF3CDE
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0x79273399F60A17B9AFE383D0C39CA05A
can feel is in her presence."
0x7A50754A5D1C408510706CE0276ECD8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x300FC2296416ECA9B40D2A1F5BC4AF98
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x992031730324F3C2AC5C7796A55477D8
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0x369DD2BD9D36B8C27F49084510C775DC
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0xB528841FC7E1FE321694013D5FC6171F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0x84ED5BEE0F573B6E0A5C90EA152098EF
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0xD3555F3D330774931E529A27AC6A0987
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0xAC12158259807D8752E3625BBC2CA2A1
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0x633F9593F45FEC62399FEBB6B266FD19
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x108970958C57A057615A7CB4B3431F01
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xACF8FB29A3AADDA71A3BB68FB0EFDE56
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x49AA31174B02113E781D00C7331B9F55
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0xC35D67FF21BF0DA8DB96B6C1C79970FC

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0x2DCE5B5A1CCE7704B0965B071483D4B3
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0x82ACE768683548BF16D57E6637B6F386
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x135DC8E4BC343B31520D13375E52933B
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0xF00D7AA6D69970B01CBE5AE7DD482C12
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0xA68BCD21DE506DAA14AE46A9D73CFDE0
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0x38499E89540AC5E1F73B5AF6617BD976
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0xEAC25D41D2898D1EFF2EED1BFB5C4DAA
she do?  Let me hear now."
0x2C6A2ECC1A49DF4DD248DAEEE619C3CA

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0xBFD1894D4F1318B03B66282788A3C08E
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x360288F361F64585316DF313CB8CB7B0
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x67078611E25FB11B69B7058EB16A90EB
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x84A9D6834CA8E76A8DD10A74A24D4F1E
deeper than I wished.
0x5F9C4BB40BBE4A0EAF35E43E9BD34A53

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x9BE99A3343B360330AC62452DD3EA0FC
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x81498753062037594F757816506595D0
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0xA66207C66A9E251EB4313B66A9A78CD2
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0xE62A5F44A6DEBBB7F0D4D6B4ACA04CF9
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x27FCDEBE8044947F370F11405EEF8AA5
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x085C6023230C401F0510E230CFCC01F7
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0xD9363D4D3D25E8BF91B36ACE358D6D25
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x7B96D083371C67243F4B74D061EB4FF4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xD73C01ACB4EE7B2E9B8D95F646E68C9E
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0x95C1EAD91755ECAECD5F8EFE7B056FDC
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0xCC3B5A31BFE292C3FFA53AB3A128A458
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0xDFD14D40242EFFB3F7CEF6AE4B0EF55E
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0x5267906997952D5368D5C2B0917E8137
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0xC5FA77C3517070FEEF2130D6BA9B9AB5
up.
0x19B2124119B2124119B212416D19A90A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
0x38EE78B1D3FB9698CF0BCB203DA52FE6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes."
0xD1AE3D19D1AE3D192D8ABAFB8AA2D3D8

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
0xEA8F526CE8B517F39C7DC6168C507B92

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
0x60FB3B9F54A3EF29C827905953BB98E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0x08DB481E265B18D05E5D7A2F2247C0C4
Or what does it mean?"
0x620BA4CB4823E54EE52808F48193AD00

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
0xC24C1A50AFC2FA6DC8EA1A7F9C635A6D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
0x404669F7A081B34E5CC75439F12C871A
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
0x3B7034632209C0066ED99364F7E793DA
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
0xF3B3BC8A4E2836D41784CF405F1FE8C2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
0xC296830D21BAF17CF1E2BC88AD8690D2
perform."
0xF1DF0604B510D357F9CBB3C5E80E6B46

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
0x7A1FD763C260721C9144407D89378957
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
0x763FA2A06FDF7E0401BF6CF4ACFFF169

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
0x4973F982BBEB0204D31F366B50B0F1EC
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
0x34E2800AE6FB3D561A356A736AF9ACA9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is he an able man, then?"
0xF2310074017D50462B4B218B9937A102

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Truly able."
0x628BAFB600BF729A2CE0DE1E6796E264

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"A thoroughly educated man?"
0xEF6586B08C7BE02A566E44E0E3D29CB1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
0x8F61A24A34B84C5B9D7DA24413D17367

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
0xB77C167FC01A8D7DB71D3EA8DCED3335
parsonic?"
0x034289F388DB02D58DCE807FBD725152

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
0xE4008E1AB3C1D9CF05DA54ADE6B69AAA
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
0x9F05199FDB52E707258D10CD49FCC125

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
0x0C8EEAF2D0FC37B8BA557B28AC8386A7
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x78698E32ED3372515540AA256E32D229
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
0x2D05C3CA21120E1A0B4B982204A7C1D6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
0xB41B499D8B2B356EEBF736432B5D9B9A
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
0x8CD0663EA9676417DBF149FF314A84A2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
0x9A77AAA7E31E7789DF53B6146C4CE227

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
0x58C5195DDD10221D92BF05E859445F2F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0x8A734FB7E4FAF1D19F08A440B97E3B54
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0x92A4B48D3C8AB70225B38AEF2E83E3D7
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x2B1CD6B44E61660B19C7EAAB6D2FA38B
immediately charm the snake.
0x4A2C94271A8151FF9065CF8521F82966

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
0x44CDE4AF6AD26C1B14453897670368AE
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
0xF1B0F6BDDFD37542230C9665CA0B7A72

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
0x3B5E1F272B4DD62295927F3851A5236E

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0x3F5973B714D953E9ABB1BEA199FDA32D
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
0xE8061B4247A4C6B5608CB577E24356AF
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
0xEC7C5CC8EC100B05B1CC263453554577
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
0x6D29E1124BF701AF9CF03407D20FBB7B
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
0x8910C0697B3AB0A193B79438DEDD4E62
bargain."
0xEF5394D11F373F3B54A513CF430EF896

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
0x3A79D9FB9A76A6FF98C41F677410E3F6
sir."
0xDF81D3EEDF81D3EE2BBE3B7EAAA7B4DF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
0xEA98BD49AAAA7FC4C8171C025D253985
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
0x6DA4480EDC65C387B1B349FFD231C89B
question or two."  He paused.
0x16E063597F508F61CC9139B41DD2CBD2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
0x1AA35033675B55FC47C2D3E960F7CF83

me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I

thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
0xBB5A5E49B9CAD1CF90349D5BD74E83A0
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we

have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
0x4271FC920B6346C20A449454671F3444
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is

useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."

truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not

love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
0x0DE2D523664AD682F8D0A4A7EB14DA55
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0x68C96B1265CFA1B3E772B3360B9F1330
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xD5E8075BD4657BA76806CEF7F497BFCD
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
0x132542E5C1E828C74C2A10C0921A8CF7
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
0x562098B5E02575F02C81A75E13B4F897
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
0x6CBE320611862E2B40E47242CAA052F7
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
0x40568DB2592AD95AB7C91323AC8D749B
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0xDC28A1ABDCD7C11D13575726352F7D5A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
0x5129631D1F826385C759FCEEF832B4C5
beloved master.  He smiled.
0xAB926E15A69F868486619B996E840928

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
0xA7F8BE9247866C40763A3B78D4F4F116
you and Rivers?"
0xD991E3AD197412B0366B1B3849E6A1CD

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0x72E4EB2187EE6F0998961A4F80D36546
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x9831B08DABBB6E0AED7F21F6B82FC995
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x5DD301838E13175E73B168B8A34D2F22
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
0x41EB91276817B5CC4CFA7DB52AE2BDF7
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
0xBEB09A81F4FCF8D023FC10EB8693B4ED
of me from your presence for ever."
0x1690229D6366B3B9E260A910F70D041C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x921E9B86743DD9F890EC235CD112D2F9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
0x6711A5CFA2C172197E6E3087C7273DD7

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x4524F1384C649C86DFF6B11C499C2765
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x185FB66DA039ED8876DE673A2CF544A8
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x866042BE06857B0AE0933858D926C1C0
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
0xA6981FAE2DD28056506AEBCB09763740

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0xA4B59AA056426839AD0BB1341F50E416
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
0xCFAFB14E1B5BAB3C5ECAB60004CF0A5B
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0xDA4C4765FD2CD2D1299BACE4244A2581

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
0x461C872AB3D29EE83BB63DA021534C41
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0xA8811FF98C15D3667C3AEBF5DB477384
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x6D66391E7A3F395D33AA6C92C5E2C713
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x26E367A8D6A854349919C409B8C1EF8D
offers them so safe a prop."
0x23A29658C0F733FF12D6691E6E950377

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
0x8AB80D780B3BFE041AFF5DCE5227B340

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
0x1B4C597D96F42C44DED0027E3E902CD1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xE094CFAC29C4B4F23BA1EDD275B3DC72
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
0xA17584EED6978F423F1CB32CAC1161AA
helped me.
0x4D189E332D2E4922CAA97FF31A33F45C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Is it unwelcome news?"
0xBDF55368ABE46CB21B22ACEE21AC72D9

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."

good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I

with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not

as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more

wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
0xAB0858A5FF342DA28824FB15AD2781A4
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0xF00FAD6426D36C377ED1601534C7598C
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
0x50CCD019B584BAFCAAE7DDAD9372F2B3
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
0x4F50DAAB52136670BF7C35152861A412
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
0xE3C16F303848E40889B974552A1DE430
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
0xE352DA64AC9BFB399E8B5B42B4693345

0x85E0DA94B1733B460AB68890E4D1B175
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x5F51F256B3650DED8A61C0E6728365FE

0x4C9ED9E60F9CF27D13A8502A648E4851
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x57EAC3D2FF397724DFF0936AF11DEA93
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to

"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,

a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
0x8251B3EDE0CE77C26DF1C533D1F4C585
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere

eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated

God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this

0x7D89DA880BD365CD8286BB4F89DD73D9
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0xED294DB5831E59965A44F6B66F171E6E
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I

asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long

enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and

point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my

that I heard what I now relate.

"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the

voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
0x95793A6D9AA3C8B31B0940C4C333B91E
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where

are you?'
0xC215539E2CA893A52C2AF56C599F6622

"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my

buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies

unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I

heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0xD924B697B9FBBD2AAA69A145CB938E51
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0xD87F524E09D6990BD33D117A6CD100FF
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0x74F0DE068A6015998C9EDB03593FAEC4
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0x60EC6A5C0A72BA3AFC59BBDE23B74B20
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were

Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0x4B35AAEE054B1F7908D8AE8CD45835BE
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0x713D4FC2EFD34B9F9C66FE2447435A1B
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xC3F9AB463CD74E6428EF3C1762D8FDD1
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x87E9C02B67078A751E5C1203BEBC7549
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0xE04C76C200B5971DE70B3FF078D1A413
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0xD223048A83DCA6C125187DE33A40162A
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x38D8182434171B18CFC983E9988364A1
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0x65904F057879521838DAA31D51BDEED3
them in my heart.

"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
0xEE0361420E8E1D00B2960E8BF059EE8C
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
0xE3881852F6B610A6D798B71E5EAEBAD1
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
0x58AC567F179F779D7E605F536C8C37DC
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
0xE0C61277BFE5FACF8FA28F51E8EC69A7
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank

He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his

brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
0x0024BF3571A80447BCFA8C25197BA239
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.

mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead

Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0xFC4E060F25C5EA523686FBF0982ACB9F
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x9958C08A0F8A4542AA98DF7610F47CA0
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We

Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and

clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0xD652AAF9A4B9688CBE6FC00FB8E6886C
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0xEA519D8080D99C1ED58F88FF165C259D
cleaning the knives, and I said--

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0xCA3581DBD94BED0B7DC6AD435D556624
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x0E26C20A6A13C2261A3D7CB7F0C9DFF4
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0x05BE8BB4BAB66A38116F0E4E6315DA5E
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0x8C30C1CF81CFAD9CB12635A69166F8F2
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x06288B75D79073EF1DCCF047979A94A4
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x854A14809C934FA9F8CB2320CEB0C48F
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x9DA93C7B6A7026CA76EE9D2A8F402C40
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time

John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x113A1AB5B2016A183CEEC9CE8F205791
again over the roast, said only--
0xBC13EE881836DFE3875FBCD3362E2AB6

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xFC2EF7B2F3B6EB10FB9F6B898C479C8D

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x6EDC868EEF4265D0C84BC93FC8B48C6E
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0xEAF618B4BB75EE710B38A951B9AE10D4
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xF2CF884051584D378754FAAC289B53CB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x57EB2FBDF62AF79A6818C2A0B7CFF743
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0xC19D189AD139730CF3A7EAF34911A431
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x6EBEDD7F14946B5BC62EC1C3F71104E1
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x099AD5177FED38519751FA158FE478A3
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x5089F9199B7C7C258331BB69C91410A3
politely pulled his forelock.
0xE53E3E7797B923D24177FCCA9341244A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0xD49608548A60BC05740D51986E1A1508
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0xCEE1403B544C45BF5F13FF44BDE57C57
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0x5CDBD947F0701A2C198B6B4B503215C9
caught the words--
0x459CA585273C53F546F3D9D47DBC6935

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x8DF59B57A5F2D83B862CA15AF478046D
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x2FE5F8D0A7710CB998B747646E550458
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0xCFC19D79D264DD674A85E8573137B0D2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0xFDBEBF389F5769F35CC8E5F8A0847F33
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x0139369BF24DC60631DF0A4CB4BC9B6F
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0x54430AC35020550903E9E6B4E89AD167
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0x62860D0F949E1CD1AB6126647801887A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0xCF9C552E7E96343700681588E45D7177
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0xF0F2885B466AD4C17E5F9AE1EE00DC8A
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0x710C72B3FE783C5F3CD50E0379221107
grave or mine."
0xFFBA145D8E39019DD5F31845120DB2E1

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0x4705A7BB9D2039A1C9AA962CD87ACFB9
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x5D40B50C22E52A217E98106EB8939A16
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0x0989BCEAFDCFB7D51D0D8779DA51F501
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0xEE90B9538A7A857D4DADFCBD03BD3E22
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0x01130AD3DB36B687D162785C8821319E
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0xC244B39F879ACFC2DE5791EE6E6EAFD4
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x7759EA5EAE1F70AE20E0E1445EF78C21

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0xDE61606367B5BD92125424FBAFE0A5B0
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x4C7C4F8AD2EB6ACA62E567821A9CEDA6
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xFA6B7DC252F473446EE91EBA317711F8
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x9AAB3F4093A2619C8A856FB44E284EB3
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x5764D23EA71F5235B2FA1BC88F863ED5
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x506FAE674BCBEFEADA095E77614E1F7D
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x637230156C8DFD91FA84129FF33758F3
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x486AE17DA1320B5D0F893C21A83C80B9
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x392766503B4AB6260BBFBF1FCC347789
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0xDE8CE7E6A1C1473969F66987FBDE5360
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0xB044B6C78896DA923BA6A9212F1165DF
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x8BCE1B87F322F8436A10B2188861B582
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0xEEA91B636D33565FBBD30E00F444E5A1
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0xCB6BD2671F1E9F54C0B96F74AD40D374
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x134F3ABCC6ACA3B242A3A1218B880C77
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0xB86B8ADE509B8D0D8748ED8A32B77214
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x72F4BD410D0736415BF84D55333723AF
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x4EFC185E75B0697AED6E9557EDBB78FB
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0xF983816E5E975DE381AB9A363E6FA491
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0xBB70D5E726DD237E28283C49BB9F1721

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0x23FBD0B2A8002470DAED8DED1CE37497
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0xE12A78A3D08430B6D01CE3EF7B5FE4B4
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0x3C3E90AB0AB2F30D654C4498C04760F2
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0x28814DF01392884FD9B615415C26093A
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0xAB6BB225E724A811948ECE94C2505478
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0x0216AABAB47B0EBC5CE2463995C9A2DD
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0xFFA879C4AB644AF7770B57BBC7C35718
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0x42ADD1A9A5137740DDD6DF13FFE12C88
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0xD83B7B789D8AF923DF36C7BA66B81704
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0x44C703F2A8E0A4BA43F1F02B0B379FC3
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x7EF6FE0A0CBC13E1DE04530F93EA710F
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x72B4442143B9E4C70EB0503A31B9A0B9
concord is the result.
0x076D0C5853654A5B84215830E2767B7C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x179E4E0DD0195DDC832AA46105A104B0
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x24536E0EC269BF5CE576D5D2EFB2EB3C
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0x58A42C069FA0D513B459078A5EEE7C88
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x7AF2296D33D0DDBD58EC87ACF1B9398E
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x675732A8E633C88CB773A1E1FF88AF3D
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0x5D989E942952D5ABFCB84DF40D1FB0C5
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0xA4CFD4B65D3E2ED6112EC7B94D761820
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0xF6593A1882951DD831EC3728D4886DBC
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0x41943027A98C59397DF747AE1B99B909
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0x6BBE49E25D1FAAE3A788DF6EA817F46A
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0x1DB995E391D375F25C95F822021ABE9E
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x6988A111B26AAB10BD7A4E73D05B0E05
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0x7480312B8F4FFC415B8C860935D271DE
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x5CB528B9B31344CC7084CA5CFB9E3D2A
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0x8F72B4F21CD7EAF25E4840CF6653804A

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0x9268436A1DA116B1EAA4F23375A6461F
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x37BDF3B6C05D578BA0CB49F0DED505B4
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0xF72C256D68AE3FCE2FD5219640CC61B2

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x226A230B1AEBAAD49A11C086998D5698

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0x3466C317D8E0B297E0DBE5A7936AB1EF

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0x5FB6ADBE72442447349D710BEEB0EB06

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0xDB484F7A5278979D1DAA944C96F22964
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xAF7AE4150217D2B4CCBF9B101001F4D6
sure of it.
0x0CE46132FEA6B1165CF8BF693C5041DB

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0xAECD5C3A8912FB725EDA5B4CCBAB20D4
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x54AA0591C5ECC8C2D5E0F897D27F159B
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0xFE63C696C87D37A00D1C95FA4A953344
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0x4F9FBB20040CF59568F02BE28681E3E9
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0xD0672D2C2E50CBF49AD801B7C1D75332
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0xB6AB9304CA1C6B9408DA6477588B14CB
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0xA8C606B64B5FB12B8E8D77B4E905F63B
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x0C25837143AA102BDE19FA18EA1E2E6F

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x1FA3916FE79EEFE56A4EA33F9FB67AA2
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0xDFBC4742872746DBFDB11281A212FD97
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0x5C5E154374433428992EC1999E164F8E
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0xBFEF1202F0AFA21264247D9E9896C0FB
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x153821FBCAA74654A696F330558C75D9
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0xF1875B31F6DADEA011377EEC1E027373
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x8D20121AC47603AA4378971BEB3019F4

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0xBDDED50442D2CB6D0C00AF581244B977
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0xDFB05E885FD162C544A73464F94BBDE5
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0xA15DF0C902A07ED250175A60225966E0
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x145AAE7FE967B0D3D121CBC32B9D7968
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x84E5A4C0E8FC7ACCFE0BB119687584FF
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x4F02F62EB41BA4409A44E517EA5A9792
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0xD961D0FEA69E39DCA1272D141584AB81
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x0449EAD9FD45B2BBB674BB0D66B1BC73
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0x56034ACCC6435EECD33E91611101A521
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0xDD3482777DCD589DA1FFF4BD684A7006
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x98631A49B895CE9F382851730EF1E445
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0x09E9A3C170A08E6BF27285241298B20A
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x471338839514D3C93B795431C77E3504
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xB10854021455BEA1CF00CD5D35CC172F
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0xBDB4B468BBADF740DA34C18ADFF5A41C

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0xFC46A05EC0A3C163BE7E8C6FAE9A5E88
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x8A93B53C0449D3CE961F49D56BCB4536
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x9A4FBEAC654A4FBB75E984A5442733E1
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0xB4033E20D1BCBC5A47BA0FA86BC0FD7F
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0x55451DD7B81A5C4499E8E48A92D1CB2F
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0x42D41A48C57BBED897B26D8563B7BFCE
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x5035926E9D1DD8DF64FA5D81592DB7CC
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x8FC39254E105F927F9BD19A7B6604EA8
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x0372B2D1AC3E9F371AB6F8ACC355B5A8
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
0x4F01E304A0A69CE9BC3B0884574F6254

0xCAAF817ACAAF817ACAAF817A6E9A2412
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
0xEC4D6271496197735026B353074B0A5C
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
