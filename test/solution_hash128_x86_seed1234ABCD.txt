A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
0x28AD7E914508F5E5F4BBC7DDBDE6088A
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
0x487E4862EA597090C43D2284C0823C62
miscellaneous remark.
0x365831CA1678EA056B02CF39D75E07E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My thanks are due in three quarters.
0xFC4A7792601CCB227CFBBE0F4A846C8B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
0x6CE52A66DF530C5F33C30152DCE3A4C6
few pretensions.
0xE66B7C7BCB7C923715333156567282E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
0x5FDC04342EDA4045B269C0ACB80D3F85
obscure aspirant.
0x33C33DDE0DD2FA9C0F458D27CE19C24E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
0x13D1B481C00966B2FE891392A6873C9B
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
0x7BF30DA396FC36BA3D7A66F473A7FB3F
Author.
0x48A64A6B48A64A6BA4430997F89BEBF6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
0x4F1F0C0CB8BD858D7FA5038448ACD7D3
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
0x9327E13AC5B22F9C62080DF450259E39
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
0x88FE85142C8319AF429C493F8D4139EB
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
0x26A83087C3A547934DA0FFD40C453D33
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
0x1327F59F087E8689036528A5AB523E18
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
0x42A8ECA28B98E6FC7AB90B932E3F3DCA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
0x03FA110679E27D4C6F5B6C8F30FA11C2
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
0xFB262F9AA806226700112D3EF19173A8
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
0x3597B59F4A22E48C5DF3D7B5C879BA56
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
0x51349EF95D99F3B01BD3AC310925FF8D
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
0x6FA06B12124AB48AD4C9CC7E0885F4CA
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
0x214F0F03C21939A724D784EC4DA0F7C7
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
0x4E17B805F951285679491D89131AAE2B
would remind them of certain simple truths.
0x90D9EDB2FFE8F3E306022CD349EF7535

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
0x988D2A3639C0E1BB2065151BA45CCBB6
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
0x3CFD4AACD78A78C6EC004D3E4FB4963A
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
0x9497C4FF8277B51B8F6DE5FC3FC8B1A9
Thorns.
0x8C50D28E8C50D28EF5418ED504A7B72A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
0xB4D1A192194BC1456B439B7ACB48E416
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
0x8D54435B454EFC989733EBAF0FF91FAC
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
0x400C877B1439DC640FBFBD5F37D5FC53
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
0xC84DB077BAFEF1412405373F9498108E
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
0xBF402B9FE342C8380BFFD91C365C709A
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
0xB8C4295869E6EF70442E6BBFC041D8C0
and clearly the line of separation between them.
0xD840C628689F88832245FBABDE2C69BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
0xB3A474C08EB17C9F5E1B276B90317437
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
0x3974887831F47402CDA79BD197929E1A
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
0x4C4F241EF25947E484A663AB9B0B3E33
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
0x7AED92D4589F0AEA17F65A2CC7421782
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
0x93C647B16D21F2E446D783AA7448595F
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
0x5152B2387A87892CAB5CD46763EC4ADF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
0xEE610DFA95249365A2E91349BBE83E30
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
0x91173FC17C29562CCF8EB3B8FE0E260D
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
0xDF08BE07105D93F5824F083FD2CC47CE
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
0x7ECB044128A4BFF6F60787CE320FAF0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
0x8398BB91F8ED471FEF135DED92FC9140
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
0xBE8B1E1024C6DB974438552355A67A54
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
0x9B1FF55BDD576927CA06CD6250A120F0
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
0x2C03477CBA86E036EEB625FDB6199B1F
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
0xB1E91FAB9C862CAD1F14A3773DE9010B
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
0xC1ECE700A48E574B904EF7603648B904
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
0xE99B5A49C6A1AD64B3EB9B19B6E169A1
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
0xA61155F43A58B82214BD43DB605D4278
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
0x49BCE3A914066F74E47959CDAAC03019
Rimoth-Gilead.
0xAE25559B0D56E94D18BEE01D29EBF65E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
0x0D9FF2F134953D14441E5F9FD66AC783
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
0x7CAC45160574DA72FD420200D67F6812
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
0xA4842091379674F8E3D11328E11878C2
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
0xF8F250CDB4717517694112A4F39878F6
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
0x68D54AD47614BB577E1B36CE02D88C90
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
0x9A6BD1251963BBF5D2F1A8376D554701
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
0xBA6CA21D438C2E0090D731FBF14E7C6A
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
0x105DA81DD90E77642414F7E434EDB4D9
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
0xFEF44CE50407BC4E89661DEEF14223E2
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
0x60B7BA54BF61A271AA71DBC3DAB14C1F
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
0xEDF5D3EADB0986870532878EF76093A1
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
0x2A414C270952DAB178FA0A98BC334F09
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
0x10BA491D05B1EA899E1D60112336F04E
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
0xD5EF0D2C7F63505E1B6405D9A7A36067
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
0x2E7FDD67BA2373FC66BCC872EC37DFC5
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
0x7C54FA2845A1A561E76A27CA646E8842
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
0x347A2B6AA413E4C995327355D672D0B3
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
0x932C36E93EC92DD901140137F12F97F9
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
0xE8863F9BC20005341C56A55BC83B39DE
denied where it is justly due.

been made, and to prevent future errors.

There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
0x5294F0709517A1EEE0D6AF5AB71035F0
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
0xF793B5C987C28B001B280CCC39924F06
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
0x4E77D3D31F6541B00DE38531FC4612F8
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
0xE0DB11CB5C5CC52DAFFD0501C5A6A7BC
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
0xFE79AEF10A82AFEC2E97B1580CF9DBF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
0xDC52CC475D7653E411A044302903D46B
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
0xE6C04443739161C7EB6817D30AA74EF2
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
0xE26AEBE32E27E0FC7B73D82B2D299AB7
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
0x31E6D00811CFB13BBB14DCEE95929606
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
0xF8105010A61DCF7997ECFBB709A3C840

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
0xCAAE5E0BDCA3558C29A3577F2888DB48
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
0xEBAFE09F5E33AB8D0520C14957C3E427
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
0xCB1A105DDFA4CCD7D27D8BD846C9EAF7
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
0x5173BDAD147ED132C15741158BB87705
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
0x12AFBAAA0E105816639FFCD475BB6567
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
0x254FC699EA6330C09A3005C1A25B839E
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
0xFD372DAD1075D2B5406510DF1C16C89C
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
0x137267502E50B8B4AAAA4EB62E177338
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
0x5B8531D12F985FE8E5EC53DACEF55932
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
0xFEE41368ECC39FBDF2E6C008018B95F1
little children."
0x2C6F678FF3A7BBBE464F798D0DE72381

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
0x7BC382DCF9F0874439B06B29EA6788E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
0xCDCC7A50D40C947D82E15B5363BE8FA7
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
0xDBDB695F75B7FD666C0C301BD109732A
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
0x1371156CD6435FE7EE2BAEBA314C68ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
0x85367C9C0CB2F9B4F5E24907C014F28B
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
0x87659749601E7B32025F4CA23ED4E00C
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
0x2840EAB2019DF5C60188FB4D93287B7A
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
0x8DD86C845B9DB0B41AEE5F8CB3913445
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
0xBB21431C55EE75EE82C27FF651CB3EE0
retirement.
0x2125C40D7577BAA0067DE8AB38AA66E8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
0x871DC59FC92A24FC86AE82D9F0282F02
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
0x44B07D002A942878733F6FBB8FC033E2
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
0xAF353C842A66C6FF0B971E75FBA2A56B
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
0x03C6E1C8B80B82E3DACE0F89897037D8
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
0xBFAB19683DB7777F63F0D38D0325149D
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
0x7AB2C489FCE1BC3891A0C6AB26113332
lamentable blast.
0xCDA4BA3B51C96033710DF8B4C6A7A177

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
0x7B534A5624056F4EE79FEDC7B38C4EB5
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
0x3385540F56B04434DD6C367BE1A03EF7
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
0x9356EA5C8CD1466D865A649C1E717E01
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
0xC0BEFEC1E485172F50CE18F71B7AFEB8
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
0x9C8C312D4EB2009D2F0CDD6EF9C9A79B
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
0xAEFDD41299E035BF8E76EAA2FBC13683
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
0xADB233AD1D3561CB3C483C3A18766DA8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
0xEE372541E8A8F47FA27D8F5C938BD66B
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
0xCD61745C3D75E4BB33F0133719AB71E8
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
0xAA53D1D9274826EA339DB4F07F294093
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
0xC25249E27FF7D94C1ECFF26740F50575

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
0x7A51205FD874161625B7F48F62654408
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
0x523DB9A42BA993FF546CF48F740B24C9
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
0x2A507A26E256D8AA5A83FD9C8B2A65FC
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
0xE2DD372E033970E7E6426289D909D657
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
0xF3E474BA1A786E072827BCDF09B635A0
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
0x036F8C292407874039FA4CAA7F7298FE
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
0x723059246301988673D88D0D527B995C
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
0x76DB3C56720F09D646D744E3685A222C
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
0xA19EC1AE48251FA788E58635358B8196
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
0x01446D25C405A2167180D1253FC3B9BB
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
0x158C165647E3D7706DE83261D73BD103
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
0x8C3ACDD3549D728E841B91E4F9FEAFC5
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
0x0ECA35D1534E14CCC09393308A232F5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
0x1073672185DE597ADE235489C625DF49
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
0x7300A2AA6341E41B46574B3359DCD83C
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
0x6FE834A82908761CEBC720B3CB7CB13E
hour of eventide.
0xDAC454F6ECB529F056EEC3A0AB6F702D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
0xE2046703335DCEEE2CAB5829758388AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
0x5B366A4548AADBA8D3AC9FA27AE344B8
quickly: it was an object of terror.
0x2B938B0084F33562E005E2FFEC6FCEE6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
0xBEC9464A38B694E3BD700FAB14318700
crowd surrounding a gallows.
0xA4A0B7DF4E0CAC86EF6EEBC533A5877D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
0x692DACA142D787403F2929DB765F15B3
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
0x96BCB8C33E84013D366B4F321E623F10
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
0xF4801CD2E36C18EF2C1AF85F3C2C61FD
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
0xBF663B1330708CBDD6783BA49815060F
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
0x2A474C4FB24E3B2B3A5E1C06D78CEAF4
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
0x281F1D6EEBC7B841A6C18677BBEC26A3
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
0xFA70A74EE48971C451A66F9A6CF6A80F
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
0xAAA4993E8AF3054E031E5393CCD98BA2
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
0x1B6107545EDDE9F5DC7CC56F6BE3474C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
0x8292691214C409865D62BBE59875502A
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
0x5F8A1C635FA589CD70633C2DEC3C7EFD
room door opened.
0x420B37887FCD11DF4F2FCB22B4498612

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
0xC202B133D78B76680C79326A0A4F0343
found the room apparently empty.
0x580D5AE5A13B46E9CD78CE12D4804ADA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
0x16BB1D22014A8ACC7838E1C3714F8B07
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
0xA089379D61A8E66D13D0417E52F3CEBC
animal!"
0x5B6041186C3029B5588191413648B15F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
0xD6148873E838B072316E1E7C3FB88EA7
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
0x29F6AF6554B00D840E2E4945DC104666
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
0x7EF0ABE7C8C50661377540123F4D03C8
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
0x38710D728291719FB519A534747F5BA0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
0xC18BB8DA41BCFBC51E96ED0AE1765CE7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
0xD20A6B0D03DD127B13FE19F9C9A41811
forth by the said Jack.
0xF0F0CBA9794B8B4A2F08205F757819E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
0xC7206B5F3CEB2B4EBB8E6AD9E17640B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
0xD2D2F63B2A093EC3B309DB22D56DB584
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
0x595F4DE03D8B9EE3E54C789999B425FA
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
0x299C036F97405919C82A695EBC6DFEB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
0x4B75D2CBD00AE55C66618642D73C9B34
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
0x0DD3D3165262A85B02CA69AD5ED8DF8A
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
0xE9216DB08F31D2EAB55E69095C34F1CC
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
0x902A7B7239BCE454D530CCA3AF6714B5
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
0x10CDCA5DB33038222D2F5FE38ECA45DF
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
0xFCC1BEAB0E2D0EEAB296A83EE9601B0A
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
0xEE9F3C1B37F5D6657B84E8246F460D71
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
0x5D0E733441A990FC817F71E2B78A3EA7
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
0x01C245348C58256F19A7F72FCE833679
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
0xF9CFB4F12656A643810E5FDE8FF96C8C
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
0x892ADC0EF4C622B23A26DE1AC3B25DD3
home.
0xA1690340A1690340ECB9F282A5D5EFC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
0x0C3261E76983457FF6BD5651D68A54B2
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
0xC9E87FD7E8E79CC7F5D5FF677983983B
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
0x8001B604991FA878B01924CEA61E0DC1
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
0xDAB076230B34F7D90B88ACB90F9335FE
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
0x958A806F76543B17B0B05938A603242D
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
0xDF8E9B09062375756C93EA709DD525F7
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
0x10F20AAD4359CA538AC1511603A08EAB
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
0x81D830860C2A0AED01B2E1835DA355B1
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
0x35442D95FD9AAF97F85AACF15970B87A
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
0xE435D4BC85CED5C2FA60263925A43721
her back.
0xAD8EC3E570160E5295B48EF8A67D1BC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
0xECC1C845A1F2D91BFB4DE4026F3ACF5A
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
0x5B245AA4E433FC7F16ED5B44914E0A58
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
0x0202BE88BCF5E347E86AB50D28D3E0B6
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
0x5820448E54707123A6B03F8622459BC1
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
0x1C79427C3A9F2ED3AC51FC3879BEE3E0
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
0x2C6B2FA8168FFCA55C6C280BB9BA09CB
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
0x29547B185E3FA665B791B5FCDBDD0F8A
chair.
0x4B840ADD4B840ADD29D88AE3876D6F9C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
0x2DDF6A8470B4DA00684653B4F8FB8893
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
0x17B8EC648001A86FF077A4EF217D2AC7
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
0x8CC09F56DBD366411A0512009360338D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
0x3DA6B847E6CCF90440D710732AF6F13D
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
0xD6B4CF549D14A7871A289B4D435DD3CF
insult.
0x8F78A2EB8F78A2EB6F87BCA792EB3326

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
0x4527C57597A6883750CA6250681F0870

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was reading."
0xBE11A6986872B823967A3F4CA2820970

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Show the book."
0x302ACD319B76F9EF8ECC3AFA357DA200

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
0x8D8BB48B91FC99B2A18903DF15274D21

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
0x07689DEA091E2CFDA0D28FEEEBF80EB7
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
0xCCBC84F8FEEB192766B9882AAA035B6A
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
0xC6C746F8AFF491A63CD2CE2D23105564
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
0x42652886FBFFA44D09BC0F6FCE4AC899
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
0x0514A0AA27306AE310BD9C00CA1D214B
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
0xC7C9D7A74E5A5C8623E811D51DD59C78
the mirror and the windows."
0xFDD4546AD92076756DBBE20CFDA74D6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
0xD7933F28F472F5F5BC8C58847F9122E2
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
0x811C8F3EF332BA1D45525674E60FA096
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
0x2C8B89F5DF431F5CACF0FEE7399136A4
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
0xB07A96B40C448446F94944B1D5EBA1CC
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
0x19C4BCD38964F860C7A3C94AAC2CB381
climax; other feelings succeeded.
0xA1BED2F9761D0C5A36BF98FA69B88BC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
0x4AA35FB24A5446ED4AB433D71BAE88DD
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
0x2E6A806CD7B5A9790FB2429A87E454DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
0xD053B1B12D314F1F274A9B2E1A241DC5
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
0xDD57508ADFDA34461BD722CF09BA8FDF
thought thus to have declared aloud.
0x1511FA5856F891AFD8A938EFC0465E79

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
0x30F3FDFB555E008B3F182819D7ECA491
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
0xB85E901D00C318CB2073C60B0FCEFD06

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
0x135BF1AC04AB669A41CE82AEA0FB0F5D
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
0x849D15EA522E6CFD647249208E4D00AF
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
0xBBA07FD462E9EF5FDEA9403294E8FED4
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
0x1026A357D3C8FE39086B92BC2879958C
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
0x2A177E834B003EAA42C580A8ADAB4378
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
0x7CE293415122A0048D4FD05948EB87DF
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
0x77679B150FA5D874B3CF69EF104F2A4E
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
0xEF2ADB692B7FEB8EEC531467CF77EFB0
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
0x6B05A3B86CECF78AB5E989C514167E38

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
0x1CB214B9E0AB2F7D1CA7B796A812527D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
0x9953C6F88C4D84D4051EB6995062FD63

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
0xAA10D1554107E1F74A4946F4058E2CB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
0xE15653D6F90877200789A09EA4DAA64C
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
0x7D76D07BD139753782DF224F1F634DAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

CHAPTER II
0x917B64C164E02956072FAAFB985757AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
0x6FC49B62DD48ED1DD39598D50EBE43EF
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
0xF77BBAB39DB426EA0178C0199B2E477E
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
0x7DADA2FFE11AD60B641A26FCFED079B7
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
0xF8E71A5350C895F4F520D5127BFCE393
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
0x631491B1AA2F1FDCA871F453AE1BA5CF
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
0x65174E44EAC3E887266671E780D7F801

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
0xF69A12C6A82BEF35C74A1B9EA1685713

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
0x49D0A26413C55FD42A0B2CA4B1E2D369
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
0x6E39363B0BDB9C101C4B14E6BAAFFF74
young master."
0xC69C62C0E84F75B9462C17C86692B48E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
0x38844D39BEE1B5CE5C51F4387A2F333D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
0x6A2D6BF46C4FCF33C9D1F5FF72441E13
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
0x97E9B48B7567C5540FBE2ED7A1A6B70F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
0x1462EF71DE4214787969480D4FB99EC1
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
0xBC2208506EDAD00EEC5EC95F887D23E9
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
0x4024D8975462CE1FDE7A7E4B3786989B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
0x6B163D9D84ACE563FC540172BD660F3A
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
0xD435B020EE4E5E77F219B9217408C4BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
0x6E5C86A824765436E737C83DA88FBF89
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
0xFFF1AD97B5BBDC9662BBABA43FA319AE
little of the excitement out of me.
0xC89FF6565B4D542077393D17905A5914

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
0xBEF5C05AF1CDB2259D6EB8233B2234A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
0xAF924B1AED4E91D58D36AAD2C3EF4E5F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
0x22430102CF10B34DAC1DF2140C77CA8D
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
0x8B76C96452C67B053A2D10ABEF187BF9
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
0xF43A91339F5E463A700E8E0D02FFE5A0
incredulous of my sanity.
0xF1498CC0956313BC24248FD07B404B72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
0x0EF75413D0F5FAEF1763E35C561E2C29

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
0x71529EBC6272F205A0055097FFCDF94D
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
0xF8BDDC0DDA24A76F5B5FEC45A25C2651
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
0x717623E577D50E9FD0F606ACDB3B3B59

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
0xBC4D8A3A4F08579F59C7658D406F6058
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
0x359D0E0561EF967DAAA883A5B0D9601E
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
0x1B42E77A82189E94494AA6B8659261CB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
0xD1E11C5615222E7FEA15B3468DAA989D
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
0xB8F3FC63DE385FD5B526947A38BD4FD1
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
0xFC1BC35285D3B84700DE3B40C96A2444
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
0x9CDB33D62C38F747A1235C96942CEA5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
0xEA9B81166B636738D544085512FDD7D1
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
0x7EBD04A6AC72CB5573B3FDB8CC70E16A
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
0xC52C91A5892BD6B3431356228D81BBF3
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
0x089A548403110092EDEA7B966E6F3ACB
them."
0x2BE81E1B2BE81E1B37E1E7F163105BB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
0x5A7EFE882F3172B25BAEE2084F9B44FC
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
0xBA0E0D28145AE7F28499A3F9FE137746
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
0x0A0888A5D7E7402D5F34D06511A599AC
away, I am sure."
0x961712D12FF7FCA9BE796B51034D6107

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
0x588A9F914C817878F01854BACB654346
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
0x6F07721BCDBE1CA5911AF0C4C5322C1F
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
0x87A833F737EAA1C10DFC6D73CF2389C5
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
0xCC188F53C663F663FEA4BEC5D8852EDE
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
0x61D5C519D2FC2D2F3BE5B46F3751E406
fetch you away."
0x14C05DD63A9DAA66F3FBEDC99FC177D1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
0xFFF005F4B48E61E7D92859610D42CC25

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
0x27F46DD2596F391FB601D42CFF1F9313
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
0xD2EB36002CD4741437CF31F05F43A28B
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
0x37385193DD7958FCD381FB95AC223E97
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
0x9850F2866B73D9FBAAF7C4E9C372C8E5
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
0xFCC926FC648E878482F2F1782E2CA2DD
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
0x8B6F0FB904E24BCDD3EB68F67D17E240
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
0x6EBE5CFB2D9D92DB525D8B8092874188
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
0xD4BE17B3AECEADAC67D93E1C1C64760B
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
0x60045862ABEB96AA02EAA9BD0F8116F6
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
0xCA29365A2CDC9DB2C1BD9910392B99A6
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
0x2C1728407F13C0B5BC07CFE2841B99EC
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
0x118455E7590C4F156EBC9BD29F19A959
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
0x3F7EF45A76460F8081C61EACEB4D0F49
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
0x7CA51E89337FF1347CF459A10BF3BBAD
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
0xDC996499C398D409E717E6C2B7D9B040
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
0x112892E12783CD489F8D010FF01C834E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
0xEADB1F747B505764CA92CE9CAB5C4806
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
0x60A749B7907015A5953A4345A611A257
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
0x3C851461B25B5A4890CB68F5E97B5E86
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
0x9727AE3EE79E0206E4532026BC617A26
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
0x2833DDDA995022518070F0E54A87113E
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
0xBBC7B7A1FFD83E1D6F893A0B122632AF
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
0xA9884791E29B71A2CAFB814996FB9896
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
0x358A2A5CE60A1071BB27F83891625267
in spite of its grandeur.
0x7182510DE3E12BD721746DA176E8EA2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
0x759C0B4BF73AC8364B3292577AC6ED90
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
0x9277A9CDF6236C4BA0499755A4C5B304
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
0x58D6A10A346D226A60ED1891B36021E3
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
0xF05ADD7C85BDB4669BCDF02C058680D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
0x1DAE1AA7558DF4AC6B42C45E6596CCC4
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
0xEF4FCF0ADAAC4667319E72DB9AFD1A35
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
0xAEA8415A3434588CC8ADFDCF3419F70D
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
0x86C17CEC849DF6CA379744901F35047C
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
0x85BAE49CAC750F7C65A4427BB787341C
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
0x813E10A529C9A8F569D4B1599E7A7AD0
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
0x7A954F91BB0369C78E314F2F41E2706F
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
0xFBABE0105C5F5CCCB64C3FC5F05245D6
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
0xE05973E639773C22764FBE240224C0B6
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
0xA39DF62A057F9CBD539E2B523A621C2D
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
0xE1019066366CD672D400F20FF77CA9C0
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
0x3C99BB5D955F8514AACBB9AF391352B8
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
0x543AEA6749C8352566F0DD586DC12678
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
0x71407D2D210C72A7DA85A9EAC5D5D36D
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
0x05751F3D0339EACB0F93D0CF9A4A2F63
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
0x48DD8CDE09D32242D05F52875093FC16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
0xAC1C5CF386AC2C3CEA4E3891D3F628CA
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
0x4244089CE4B2D536859BC56638BD716A
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
0x91DFD461FBAFA4D41CF01C5926805EF0
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
0x1030510EDE4CD9C3D2E417D003967D96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
0x40C43A15CA096FAA9BEA4EA767C54ACD
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
0x09A847F37DE4E16B8E53215E2F222D25
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
0x78FA880800294053535BE9B2B9C14823
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
0xC797727CD7A5B1769172A4CBC3B70180
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
0xDB32B9BDDB8A1AEBEC29BD0548570104
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
0x148150B4D11914722411789D79F80618
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
0x7D8AB8A14A834567FA3CE156AC4DCD65
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
0xDAEB3A124B4199FD516721C82F29848D
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
0xF0F429A9344AF13748FD03C85843D343
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
0x44D12F7865566E3EEAEC41075027A8FB
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
0x39D1DFFD2D86DC007FF0D7E2910C6ADA
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
0x12F6E516C3E8F15F554B50AD48469563
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
0x7DF2D1AAE466C0D4D0C8C009D6030FF9
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
0x9963F08ADE3E540EFE7344146B78CC87
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
0xE7E56592778E241E95F709142EA3F6B5
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
0x8ABD21FE149B1A1791EBD631835F5511
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
0x90D727A0EA60B6E4FF18AD3CD256929A
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
0x48128773CC51D584099EF8D811E72730
night.
0x1B72E4B11B72E4B138F5236E71A6F001

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
0x1308CBFA52AC068CA646F9E6FB3D4FC9
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
0x6B81A32827827DA69FF949724AD43994
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
0x31BF60A62CDDD381ECFFE686D0ABA91E
general opprobrium.
0x06B5964A438518B03DA6A9F5F2D75077

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
0xFD263396535CEFF463B03F0E1262EEA2
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
0x24C3104759979F87A24872F3C87A269F
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
0x3479EC0706D8CC27C0D7AF08671EE5AA
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
0x4C5DAE10F48734FE687386868CB2C1A9
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
0xE0F72125F1F061729119A506411B30D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
0x348DD248859066815431B46030CB0065
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
0x80EFFE190E7DEDE966A882D8B1FA2E43
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
0x4B1D54520178CC2B528DB5CA88C72DE5
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
0xADF656BC71D18302FD84A766A12CE514
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
0xAD77370AAFDACE5F924E34B544B14003

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
0xA6A69DA29BE640013E21C572FFBC4800
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
0x682F40206056663A413339597F15E2FD
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
0xAE455DDC5D5B2841725C8931EA94856A
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
0x36442F7B5E69BB897290CC4EB93F44BF
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
0xFBA8184975FF0EBEB9FFDAE6DB5BDF72
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
0xAB12B44A44BE0488932691C5BA1AC45D
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
0xA37B13B728C3EAAEC7C07AB82A4DA709
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
0xDE0EAB5D610A0AB03CF78069E4C66C30
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
0xC9B01EC3AE37442396D18C94B4F3424B
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
0x2FFF9EBC65CEE415A7DBA792A0FFBBFB
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
0x7A48EC427445A847A72D4F9D8969DD68
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
0x908401ABA1DFDF88872D5B8DE75DF7F1
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
0xE2443970580376B5980491F0B689A67D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
0xAE45FE6A3F32F55AE1D8780705BB45DD
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
0x1419CD5E2F04BB6A36FEF8E8BC28CAA8
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
0xFAC858B53E54E571DE3A5C14F03C0DD0
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
0xEAEEC56B45CCDF6F9032414736B4EFBE
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
0x1A05B95EF3C60A6DC7E014D978C999F7
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
0x86835106449E1C78A97379FAAA8EBB34
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
0x91BE9E6F0D9C7AB832F4A84CE7BB0009
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
0xAF3EEC17252A8EF989DC8C4B0538D6DC
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
0x4E338856690B0222DC47E6F0B9452BF5
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
0x6850DE8AC1F88FD4F27AF6CA40A1960D
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
0xEA724913FE2F0B0B09CFF0D64DE97598
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
0x0F47D197E5D6B475E7CEF8F16980FEA4
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
0x9BED57EEF51FC1C45DA2DEC258B7186B
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
0xF97AAB1F6CDBFE7F6DDCC4B97C9D7B2F
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
0x526FD29046FC828151F04006B37C6252
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
0x4AE1843E210B106E37D57E9D9E364CCC
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
0x477E70554A4ECA1E4CE336161F4D71D8
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
0x888DD798C242CFAE61B6F180FA325743
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
0x9BD3326CD5185BD3C468349638D2DAB9
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
0x54C8328FEFF47B0BD0649E90F2A2D2A7
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
0x3BFB40B2B1E58372C481BEE21F8A68DD
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
0x5BA4B1362DFBB3B7D657BC01D5EC902A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
0x7FCD2FACF8BA75B55C840E186A12DDED
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
0xA599C94BFF627523A3E5A91F1C0EA479
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
0xC0A36D6863314B4411DA78D0FC5D6BBF
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
0x0F5362BCAC47E4DCC3FDCA0CBD59EC81
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
0x8D7D4DB0A0182401447EC3B259D276E6
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
0x9F533CC45B5364AEC8331C9A42EF19BC
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
0x796E18575C5EB3D5D7F39F056FF74CF2
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
0xDC28503F7D609729F29C7948F31BFE57
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
0x46709FFC65A9B57D7E545A86D1D426B6
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
0xEAABB0F578BC518EA3EAD954202B4348
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
0x63F148C62050419511C07C5333202238
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
0x9536A04295DC77CB08B6986882E8FE80
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
0xCADF88BE17A5CD53F5F3615A0447DE64
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
0x9EB06185AED3820D8A703DE5DA3DB117
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
0xA2AF4DBEB057D7E1B6B1FF81CB90D695
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
0xC8EF34FA620012AEDBB16B80A4680510
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
0xCB6F76F9B1C6A7003AAF3657CC74EB2C
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
0x7468A19BF1574D379D97FCF4D15C2719
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
0xBA1DEE5772244FE87A1FA1E98D721430
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
0x9665230DD9A2CE7D44A12B622C566CE6
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
0xB9CE5B95D61E5E0C0650D458C337643E
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
0xE1B3ED90A3D41B1987A59F5FC6DFE365
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
0x6B5C1B5F7C02EE25B4479C01855633E1
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
0xD625DE116C93B754B15157AAAD480FD3
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
0xB926AFF959C4EE8BD02AF5C19D3BFF45
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
0x053B0AD3B1579687830971D1256E919D
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
0x54E391E9A5C156C6CC282A4332E60FD8
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
0x24A2338AF8502AE142ECCC88716E63C1
Abbot entered.
0x87BC3498E9173C4E0E75CC1948D87854

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
0xA241EDC123BF9D7697745C14DFA1B3D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
0x0CAED280C235397117399DF9D108D1CB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
0x7D05E4A8FFDFC1A5F7DF15A9D022917D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
0xF844EC2C6A7D3953810F7B1E96E0FBF6
Bessie.
0x141D51FC141D51FCE5B181C729D5F185

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
0x1D4ED77CEF43AC097683C6FF6206A36F
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
0x58B28072FD0121BB96647960B511DCA1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
0x697FEBF7BCA78CB82C327A1BABD55FAD
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
0x1FAC74FD5A30F7B304483288EAC74BB9
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
0x6DDF830B5A277FA08293FA4A30445A26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
0xAAA5F0D6F33CF235FC3002B52BA43144
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
0x8A09B9AE7AE18860DB2BCDC48735B341
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
0x310C1DC9E607CA16FE0C91E452B7733D
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
0x7E20E689A413A82F5AB89405158C6C03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
0xA7CBE4F1A07762445EADC75AF4EE51FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
0x220DEA6402A23850192392E320ACED75
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
0x8B2DFB24092B2E155EF9E9B16DD77426
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
0x8BECBC4231F1A2A713E24DAC5F72E927
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
0x341526A3214C70E7A7603F89DFE77DEE
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
0x4F366D89DE8A541DEA62B8D13553D2AC
then."
0xD137E803D137E803BB4841C606AFD4B3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
0x066BE13EADCECBDB2068413461045051
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
0x1544FF9FF290322CAFFCAFF4E8671295

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
0xB96B3F1362ABC89418031BCEED4C8AD9
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
0x1A2CCA6C862F3A6EE893259062E1C66D
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
0x1BBE6171999B5A5CDC921890BD8F2FD4
duplicity.
0xF66658DE370D261F454F2E3C5B287045

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
0x5C0AA849CD75298876194A8B94DA51BE
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
0xC0A0913F84B53B92FBB355D6AA1A27DE
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
0xB978CAEA311D22079BB3312D615BD73B
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.

CHAPTER III
0x36CBDA57E778E794F14EC0CFA1F5B099

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
0xF34B07562F1BB60C220BE5ED258F987D
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
0x26C971760AED4222E781931770A2CB82
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
0xF51557B35EBC840A111E009EE6F67883
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
0x4F8EA878CBECCEDE40D3B7ADAD2EC66B
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
0x3A0F54243FA2DD717BC93E9B2BDBAC2B
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
0x1600FB13CEEB3B7943C8C147807B320F
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
0x1EA0D83F777DC8F947889243C9554683
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
0xC60DD2F1F331111A000C98CED972D512
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
0xB4287F2E1B86C8FE20D987A9F5757AFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
0x63799A29BA078F86F86C615DF3BF186C
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
0xB8D5339122BE09E5230896FAF3A83D92
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
0x82C5F7C89FFEBC03A78CC764B3FA6C67
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
0xCE2F80641DB010A62172643FD21978DF
pillow, leaning over me.
0x06127E797AF8F85008302F8BCB82F6C1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
0xB85EF1578148FDFAE8F558458DAE8FA9
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
0x31CE1A864E0CA2A3F7837B636D75FE3A
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
0xC4F6C58E8B412EA444AF36DE0E50542B
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
0x9A3CDA8BFA936973D89F6AE8177D8557
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
0x32BD351D9C8E820A343FC197CD142BB7
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
0x4655A032922CA57912B6A1AC16BFFE68
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
0xB2F8D71B266E1DF13A3B0BC132DAABD1
herself and the children she employed a physician.
0xEDEE0AE7414EF43F369F656661977A70

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
0xCA6D45518DD9DB48D03CC8E0672865BE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
0xEB82B2F5D92E4A305DC0EBC0B91D5403
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
0xE7A27128238A11E173D37DA2C0E04AF5
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
0x6F13C9C34C7C7D6262889E9CC6B36DF1
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
0xE8A4ECFAC6372D719A5307AF5836224A
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
0x2B2FA1CEF337CC7E32DAA1D2AE3F7F55
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
0xB9547FDD57C027B150432BBF7E6EE000
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
0x3306AC1B6173E5E0105353347850A760
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
0x6937B8D18470692A3855E387A66B1DBC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
0xE9A6E79BAA9B43B7A635067C23BD149C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
0x2E2A74F30261FC9778836E8B5BCCF230
rough.  "I will try."
0x1BC98DE535313B71EDDFFE9203D17DAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
0x002163E3B829DBC10C6F748D118C8BA1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, thank you, Bessie."
0x6C3D4C407780FE5F909D3265CE26F3B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
0xD2555723F56AC4B08A3E08E1FA021EF3
may call me if you want anything in the night."
0x946C14CE1584FF742DD7FBA59F95313A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
0x8F92D8256E1E62E8DB607954EB261F5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
0x3485968F8F2A542C879F3EC751611129

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
0xB83DF3896BE50C2BA2FA6AAB6F9185AB
soon, no doubt."
0xD4D0ED2A3F5AA0D0303E9EB59EED469D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
0x27B8A993A3DEA8F31BC66881ED26B4DE
say--
0xAEDE482FAEDE482FB520F9C497CB014F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
0xD91E57BD4AC64ADD038B62882BA43E87
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
0x5CC4EB07B86CFC6F1EF7C553E35ECD23
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
0x6D2F252F820139115C382AE94F7E3257
rather too hard."
0x67086557FF62B6893F1C5400BCE93229

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
0xCAB24618529EBD8702EC94E19B73716B
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
0x93F39A3AB5DF6636F5637388FFFD5D0F
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
0xDDA48D104B6CB957C18E09ACE0C02B82
the main subject discussed.
0xEEBAE421A83005FC9FDD39D4BDB0518B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
0x7B1F564071A18EA642DEAACFDB31961F
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
0x494FBA6A3EA732E11C2BC551B2AACC0A
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
0x625F5B9774057375ED36CF07AA8598D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
0x12A884C519C03B645A3DD05BA43FA9EC
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
0x778EB07D55DB64B3696549495B629EDC
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
0xDE3DB3D0B040A72783E073424FFB9745

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
0xA6798775296C3D2DDFD528E314505AA5
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
0xF88BC444C1060543E38C22CD4D8D9CE0
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
0xA4A96F59C8A488B51F8F806AE11EE847
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
0x8882A0A0BFA4CA418F00FDA8245D3961
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
0xB35AEC3D539C450A4A3567468C274029
bad propensities.
0xF9F305D4A558CD0B830DCE05BC5B0BC4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
0xB29EB4E23652B654CB1D92B6902F83D6
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
0x3161DB607F5A541B8A22F3D289B6AFFC
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
0xE2ABE249EFC12738AFFCAE67011FA355
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
0x32AD5F7625D7CBD14E1BA726CEBD3AF6
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
0x51D76BF740224D8B1FED3C117FDB04DD
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
0x0E9505F17F160581A41305E27D93C31F
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
0xFCF33D339F73830850E2C2557B868938
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
0xB5B0576DACBAE4A751BCAD5238BB0E10
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
0xAF40EB56D3AAE813A2EBB6BE8BF7B312
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
0xE5271970D02EA1B73F437B4ED918F096
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
0x8D1FF592546CB3BE67111EB6E0683716
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
0xCA02F67CFC38D6A12CC97084430D0542
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
0x01DBC0489E00C4CB2EE9A9A59F9C704B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
0x1F8260E899545F26837017F80C3D7308
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
0xDACA16845975836CB12AEEB3962CAA47
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
0x2B4203DE82931E2D1653A2403444A5B9
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
0xC8F2F1DC634A651F68D7AB0432F222D7
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
0xFAA7FFD907ACC04077C5639597653371
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
0xC8416344221EFD3D80197D6A74FDFD40
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
0x02AC5C0D4F7B5421CDA10B5075B57BE9
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
0x69303BAC4DE13E570437724ED35D01B9
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
0x457D891E9C04B5E1DDE72C9BFDDC5DA9
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
0xC08279BE3765899A45B2B94476F95075
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
0x55CB26495A45D8BA1B8A1F0C6F1A0C2E
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
0xC24B7A0D050E748D616A3C139BFBBCA1
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
0x331BBBA13DAC15F1238309D689D91D4E
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
0xF4D554953178665BABE5EB424F8BDD3C
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
0xDD414B9DB54035C129D3D3C6FC653621
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
0x36C841D25384B2FBE7B6ED704D145390
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
0x875B3D99B6FD22ED1D80A5E6BBDEE07B
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
0xBE66EC1B0CBFCBD3FCD6333B4C25AF19
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
0x734714A517BD3FE9ACC32466E033AB0F
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
0x73146592471FFCC8A59AE567BA17AB83
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
0x68A6CE083938198B2B523AE921B6A5C3
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
0x90BD8326F3052F19267A9619A799C6F9
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
0x70195DDFA2554138F8F69C8A019B5B0B
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
0x8BB5CF446A483D8FA7DCC8F56E1905E1
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
0xFEF9666DB59434B453CCB05F5E9E89EB
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
0x19D481A9B71B27F58D2FCBADC1404063
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
0x94E5B9B2BEA32E041C2C4230B02F8877
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
0x2CFE40C56B0146C2A7EE68D569756A6F
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
0x7E274F415AF438876977F33E44750EB3
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
0xA87C15E985D686581DAE3D219AB970FE
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
0x5C96D9DE932C49AB5CCED66D27119260
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
0x5EC1E769B6FDD176CDC943356E9A93C1
untasted tart.
0xA57D6220104EABE35BF93D7DB98BFEB7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
0x7915676F0F93A70B239327990A946EB3
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
0xC0F18EF27721D8F9CE7698229A44DEFC
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
0x6A936BF65D161D6E9D5B0A23CE92BD4A
Meantime she sang: her song was--
0xA816F1C37B51B086321EE960EDE87671

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
0xD02EC0072D50A6732F3DB1753C5182DE
      A long time ago."
0xE9298B327676EEA2859E9EC144C07544

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
0xAA246F69FC6441FCA4B4EC7E2654BFAA
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
0x558AFCA56C2534B846D55592330C5209
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
0x5258D984B42F6BD0BDB1EE838A5B3E40
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
0x75A268483400C3AFE16996C78BEB6DCF
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
0xBACE45437B426C25A74BDBDE4740BD28
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
0x206E581D9AFD57F3C5E1D42DD5C46398
one.
0x86C6A3EB86C6A3EBE7787DD09AF0D822

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
0xC41919935559C5EDD6BCFADB972FA1E3
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
0x89CE32F27339FA64F30A1504EFC4ECA9
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
0x68F9C0231AA5F30229446E38DC134ECD
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
0xC41472FBE80B3D991CFAAAFAA678AC70

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
0x3B2472BFF915EA8D039FF9AC8F00F94D
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
0x2902BB6D4AFB6E8A34817863EF16F429

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
0xDD0DB78D631C3E334445973CA48F6A8C
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
0x1501E85B1DCB7A24F80459A9A6AFF523
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
0x32E1C7ABD136819523951BFE23745DCE
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
0x99DDBFDE6D8C29CF2FA11BD589BBF744

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
0xB7EA5DDCADB1232B91F43823C02FE9AA
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
0xAB58D23215D519FD2A778FF8AC262AED
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
0xDEC36E38939275A1DDF92C8F38428931
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
0x7B66415C7B7E9AB11D18C71EB516CA16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
0xDD2B22B429B6FD8F494C68D8433D3DA5
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
0x3FB6D874BA2645B05D8725B3D1C2068D
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
0xA39860976AD7A237A29751083A529CE3
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
0x83230CA8C5314F50B39F4B1ADFBE548E
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
0x712041EA70B8DFE149308B3DD4825290
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
0x4EEBDB4E8C58EC97318BD1B0FC99D9A1
Lloyd came again.
0x9E7349C20A8875678ACFAFF9B76FC6CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
0xB3319CF037B88D40616707570FE0D9EF
how is she?"
0xD8127904BA9E76208987C41AD00300C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
0xC388C8C0D2D903E8F31AADCB31A5B520

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
0x39AEBDF6B7DEDF76298C1762E14FB2FA
is Jane, is it not?"
0x0547073E94BB9F059E0560358C07155C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
0xF677A28624A46A1080B1A5D4C560451A
Have you any pain?"

0x8477AB76B76503AE7E5B17EB8588028E
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
0xE8593FBAB4032453D38D697824B8B558

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
0x5CDB75BD57D0E1C9F646018D0CB8F0F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
0x7FB1F03727C80B086362BE18BFD61382
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
0xE0613A17E9BFD1AD8765246AB07E7385
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
0xBF8181784A0A3020AF57EE47280110F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
0x7DBF7CD8CD05925CE81D5B4ABE679DFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
0xB1EA9370D4836D39ED38DD6B9E4FC7BA
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
0x23DB5A58F9882708CCAC9239A232A664
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
0xD5A93981A943026BFA95C9D9B6BB2336
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
0xC5A6806710558E3D9F0C7FC117E34706
leisure, he said--
0x1C28197914CC6BD50005010BC09EBA2A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What made you ill yesterday?"
0x94B7074A9D71CBA4C606D2D2346F48F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
0xD13B87F9D5BF0F6C179C75035D85301F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
0xDB2C2F203C958D93F6E6D2FB74B6322D
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
0xA65C4F00AD5E5D44B10056D90100ADE8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
0xD38D5890C2FDD850FA3DB0504F689585
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
0x207E428F85E6C83E701BBEEDEAC73B28
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
0x9ECFF786315C12C36EFD00EB5CC56644

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
0x76F8574D0D827E99B4D730CA99302C35
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
0x6D10D8B4A30BE9172E713909B1C7320D
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
0x18CFE2FD90A6AB70DD5F7822F59AC56F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
0x71BC23CC26BB3AF646E1B3F8BDA53DDA
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
0x1EC92C1DF041AEFEC20F9C87D2C1D6BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
0xBCD4B3BFBDD638421C9F89F6ADA29FA9
Bessie was gone.
0x9DC28BABEC5498D558A93C3502588741

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
0x75DD271AF8054F5AF9D21E63A5B43F1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
0xF33B55C3EC2EE5AE11CA651B230BB7A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
0x4CD8208E865EF4ACEA52C75F22DB83F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
0x0810692DED91A88AC9A9AE52FD27E475
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
0x563D55688B3B1DDF969BAAE571920686
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
0xF0A1FC88B849D17E7EF314D3A37A5A61
that I think I shall never forget it."
0x3F5D4FD95AEC7D21CCC2325A22D2CB1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
0xEC36054BDDE27AB343ACE90E9E5BAD26
daylight?"
0x14CBD6D836F20ACB3731E8EC0E32F2D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
0x69DEA8F8DF8FA0D0878F17459E073E1D
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
0x82A7CD161E9FF979CE707DE19EA0EE19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
0x246071C4729228873FF79161E3F4D04F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
0xDDC9DECBC1D22F6441DEB431C631F58B
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
0x74567612116D06084D50BB77B9295EC6
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
0xA5EF56059E08F8B51028FEA6FFC1B948
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
0x7A9CABDEF366CE70762D65B4D0310B20
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
0x2121C376FD80122606A5B4EA2F65F184
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
0xFF24CEA5AA7C275F5C5BB7D22B1ECCEB
though, as far as it went, true response.
0x90576BA4561172510444B7BC1C716A0B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
0xAB64EF690896B74209C111DE01B648D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
0xE04E126CEB7FB8775F24AC338607576A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
0x3B3622CC1CEE0E1BAECA76D24B135836

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
0xD197F47EDE5950976A2D475B03EA6894

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
0xECD4FAAE877632A20182A37899DF46D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
0xB30B6F2CAB3E85B3173E1F443DBC7793
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
0x2B79F80E0F24D8CA0EF0838E05577857

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
0xFB433973939381A8DE5213F3FE079B70
than a servant."
0x744F734BFC8443148B74A8FAEC8EB6D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
0x72007FFE92DDFEC76C5D2E3AA47D5566

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
0x4DECF570FF7948D305A578F4DCD9C456
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
0x488E81DF0957974964584CC53C7A682F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
0x41C776A00520A82DA8F8B1FB83FB4E41

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think not, sir."
0x7229CA7CF4A7AB627A570839F11FB6E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"None belonging to your father?"
0xA5BFE9100E74B31DA4DE4226A8B1D443

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
0x21E9D1A2AE1D968C876BE1C0BF299208
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
0x5B19C1FF5A8A39228151CCF0D458B645
them."
0x2BE81E1B2BE81E1B37E1E7F163105BB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
0x4F8EE58201E84AC2554BBCAB570460A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
0x8263EF7F64947D9C795FAB45AF762383
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
0xBC40B1365E8B8C7A261FA8D95A0F8993
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
0x288D98ECAC611D7D5833D26C79481A5B
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
0xE9D3DD049E01FBE5C794A388E57D6515
for me was synonymous with degradation.
0xAD599A6C6D1CF52257466DF55AE225B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
0x6BF1F16FA937CD4168E47C0D9397AC26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
0x0DCD8B3292E34D34F35382859820E16F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
0x54A17643B16DCA1B440A20A5D26A378E
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
0xCBB14B5BAC24C273C27C5895CD212C09
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
0x93AEEE5D27F2DA1A9D27A8AB4771F24E
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
0x6DE91245B6AB9CBD410A637039603EE9
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
0xD7FBBEC197AAC770409DB7C035642E59
the price of caste.
0x57B5F1745A508B4C20CBF78522F3D8D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
0x6461B072D3B407A99AB50E2AE83CAAF1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
0xE92C9AC7ED951BCDDC0E188CAA4D80CB
set: I should not like to go a begging."
0x762110D978E8B3407C282A4F2BF61248

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would you like to go to school?"
0x4B60075402B6320B00ED3A8E9F234EF4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
0xADDFA9F9D6738237A5C8EA738EEB7CDC
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
0x61E2AE1BB4419AB01A8BD629A8A6C5A6
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
0x01B60CA3ABC78C6EE8EFCBC9F5B55AFB
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
0x817CD1F70850A2AB1082E1D1048D9956
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
0x12CDDD69B577438BFCF6F224C9ADD7D8
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
0xFAFDEA3B5435FB1CB97ED7D57318328A
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
0xDFB38898246ED857197896F9BBF36071
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
0x2ECB22925BA85BAA33B78D861A13FEB0
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
0xF060BD24646B1D540E2C0EFC6244821E
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
0x97D64326BC7CD21C1A8F2163A0682B90
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
0x0A036966AC06B4C2EBCEF876C2F885B6
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
0x9D0CFD63F0BAF39FCE7FB475A6AF6DCB
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
0xDECD9146D212D60FAFE14236EEF106D8
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
0x10F2DA62B96620E098B707359D06301B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
0x3E64F046F48439C1383C63244A78AA31
musings.
0xB3AF9363CACEF1C57D6759973A4CED8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
0xF4C9155B29C4A0EAB1C87F47A8B84059
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
0xF983C1A8A413E749FE62F42D93880EAC
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
0xE4FA3F92A84CA3176D107C2069030B1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
0x5F9EF7518217449FE5671D7B946BD2B7
the gravel-walk.
0x48DFDBF2FE5F72510C6EC8D1DA81C67D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
0xF756D970D325850C9658589C24D39EB4
to her before I go."
0x94771646A4EBD5FB1078194ED68F50B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
0x3E47B3533ECD86E9A28FCF65120DBF7E
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
0xFE00BAE3AC55AFCA9D062F78EFA4B7BC
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
0xF3A616012BEDFEC5FECA561482821BAC
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
0xC573CC1FCBE3898632D6AB68D299F8D7
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
0xFF04B601EE25888AB82C5C950A0517E6
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
0xD28D8E9DB82C1B51C197C5626BE6424F
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
0x5AF6671AC0902159ABB978EEBC8992D2
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
0x503578713FABB828210769432E117917
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
0x9B5F7589146AE4EB275F1857FDA1494D
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
0x0583AFFBF58B4C3CC43FCF3B2C9D3638

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
0x6522AF0C85E4872B5626D04FC9C60667
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
0xE2D4AEB20803683C62E1F814A2386EC8
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
0xF97549A779ABF7929E61E18F8AA39A12
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
0xB349E76D120191EC17455F1BF2059D90
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
0x222461F88F4E8B767105F13F80FCD937
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
0xC20CB420A4109B36CE44F18460B6325D
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
0xD40273112B91CF73D1F1FBE2F3901963
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
0x1C9E08CB92CEA7FD0B10CBC281293093
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
0x69E6DD3E6ECF7F3378D62B8EDBE2ED20
of each other.
0x791998E6A0EE20ECEA969424FCE407C1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
0x057E501FBD9F476A4E823FC1DA8AD94B
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
0x1A7E5FF9C49593B4DE48F6E1C79A6DA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
0x90F55D0A919778A28C9EBABB436BF8C4
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
0x69F0808F4C5DDAC006137A08EE47CF2C
little toad as that."
0x590C2C462FD2BB40D8325657595E759F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
0x77AF4E3C7831369F8FFC1AB58459B4CF
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
0xD5EE05B6D839FDB277D68EEE44895F8F
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
0xF94CAA332B463335A581EE8BC1B67906
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
0x7C3B08F3189AA0074A1064846F0E9996
rabbit for supper."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.

CHAPTER IV
0x4411B6F5D743F3D8A590869DCBF8C541

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
0x514A8AD8967DFADA19E5D80750EE761D
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
0x42A5B6057D2AD436CAD39ADEE2730B6D
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
0x26550222C0F889022395255A295D435A
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
0xE64D12D5739255B258A301217DE46EC7
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
0x2887D863A0525BF59E98D6D55BAAE49E
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
0xF1C4F7A8428DABC86563CC6BD02AE425
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
0x0788993025C2CB978CC39B9BD72768F9
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
0xAA8CD70CD602A43521EA9000322BD943
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
0xB462CEBF55CE23BD7E5BA21BA4AA1864
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
0x175393A3ABF577BD7A31A5AB1542B766
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
0xC17B5D1D887DA3B4B8E0E29E75EC446D
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
0x574C8E6BF34A9C474C88BB704F7F71FA
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
0xA3F96F52C94EE9C7ED9662F7EB802C72
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
0xC122973D671E1E982BDBBDD1ACECC3EC
and rooted aversion.
0xFC91DA68179414946AE493424B60B6C8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
0x351A4BFCF5B99B82E717CB0B1D2EB9CA
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
0x846CF0EA0275B3270CA811C9F7083D22
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
0x560309A5917220DF6E337A0446378D36
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
0x06A42B5B9F8129241AFD063156213574
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
0x29527DB8B1C2935CC86F9AF6503514CF
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
0x62BD4B5042FA4EFC37DA79D45C88928B
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
0xDCFB18ED72C9F76948F8D7417042D649
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
0xEC65DD65B90FDE4650A06671A6A1C7F6
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
0xA5D5F8E54ED93DE8D3D928B6DC190D03
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
0x92C496BB3DC95A54500F36B8030291F3
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
0x228157F5103EB8067B8B7A8B6E323C32
was stopped rather harshly--
0x99286C036B453DC2266E00F864E8B7A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
0xB0700327A382E146261EFD2817854709
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
0xCB7CB603C3DF9E2538893664E2CEA7C9
should associate with her."
0x4986A955BB0C62979D37E53D8023AE6B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
0x8C80CAC05C51735E40F4FAFEE404C5F7
deliberating on my words--
0x069E11B2A9470B399DD08F593967379E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They are not fit to associate with me."
0x409A4AD9F773FE196F117F9EB835079E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
0x6B0BED38E9F139C901AF3F08C2642A3E
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
0xE2487B6699017688D208AD572526E563
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
0xF32A7330D4DF8A9DEF5C17E7D50B845B
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
0xCBDEEBA41677B16B763F5E455D1801D2
syllable during the remainder of the day.
0x3DACD5ADF63971BF683557F1EB6184B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
0xD51A30B545E61A8636E130DD4C3D3140
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
0x8DA9D1F88FA6573C2542B4A48FA1EA01
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
0xCECE5456FE76CB7AB5F16A87E3C6F181
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
0x7C7F38A5BF994B762D5C012A9A697258

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
0x9F20D5E17D89DB2EA358913A022504C7
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
0x64EC236EC3C4555F17CD3AB6121819F0
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
0x1B9C942B2DFA3909A8D7FE2D7E138DAB
fiend.  I was now in for it.
0x62CAE4633AC88BB41475D6CEC72D6DF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
0xD9273D05774179B27A851828F804D9D6
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
0xAB478DB70EEC9B50D7B6AA21114001E0
wish me dead."
0xF99E1103DDD6331222724B211B287D8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
0x115D84BFB603A75B61F81F866EE6662D
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
0x6EA22AA865A7E32537658159C2E7AFB6
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
0x5EE8D6B5CA6D7BD3681E93134FE0F24C
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
0xA36DC2E7F8DAE583058357BF7DB954AA
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
0x51A99DB8B65A7050ED5D33B7C9657330
in my breast.
0x0F6C76D64696D85F4847112250E21860

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
0xD4E13D30E52AAC60ACEF0A46B57C9C9A
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
0xE238DEB188B280232E73360983FD2B93
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
0x9A9EE7A8D24DE3A887226A812C9857FE
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
0xFC5E060899F7E58FF9866440ED2B6E59
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
0xE7DCCF8C6EAD05B065C0EC4AE4463219
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
0x56BDE06FDC52CB4F57FD20887C18EA2E
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
0x32940D158386443A9F550ED79953222D
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
0x9678B7BDCC0F5C2BFD114D05A3E483C5
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
0x5A5BD83C814F97E1C5BDF569235CF72C
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
0x0F66322EE7B4173F783AFAFADE83015B
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
0x4E6527A25820457812E9F9C5299AAC72
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
0xA0A1B74C9C392E777469971524070162
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
0xCC1D881C7BC5766C45D564082D0273B4
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
0xF43AFB8DC2B0937B8867EB9D5C7AAA07
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
0xE375F6D3FC7F6AF102747021B4DA678B
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
0xFB84DF2037A5B51EE10D2D7C5C9C9748
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
0x919296F9DFC0C7BD588EF0ADB8E1E068
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
0xF6290C2D8F14FECDEF7010A305970CE9
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
0xA5C715EF3200F439D13351C3FCD55B52
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
0xEC8A7BE58FEDAE79AA5E2C1F857FD2CC
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
0xA516504226916AD6DBAD851D5BBFA4B0
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
0xB8FC8805709866A0A89BE72E117C859D
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
0xACDA9386EDAFB4C7E6CFBC00AD55FADE
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
0x7F8E5E4365139813FCD13807953B4F77
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
0xDE9D6D7EED8AC407EF5F9A200BBF8D7C
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
0x0E90ACAF2F019F864836D2C357792861
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
0x66A1388E8C8B93BC80335C490E324E5B
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
0xFD5157DF7DFAEF7178D090F67B8475E1
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
0x01A6548AB60B99F2788F25FC005B48CC
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
0x1F3B70EE259082EE7AFC865B543F6BC9
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
0xA736AA4BC2278F0C7D9842979F5FD673
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
0x08E0E48548DD03BAA676B411B58D5F2C
to be happy likewise.
0x99619366F98CB744DA83998459B3C3DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
0x2D1A7B8555F4EB44265E579BC634B875
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
0x0E6A3816193875588D48B7C0E64586DD
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
0xF8015C247A7B10BA365F7B93F0C318A2
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
0xF20E8056F73AEC502DF5941764482E77
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
0x534211E248E7FD11F88DB11902A0A1B0
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
0x2B41BE1893CAD921C2A2B9D9B22BC448
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
0xF2B6067FC2157F3DE2FD1D293DF4C867
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
0x2C593FACF8F346F73B2EEC7AC1B9E6DF
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
0x54105DA283FCA6DDEE2D0649F751E4AF
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
0xB6F7278D835F5485C10C6B7F39D2CB89
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
0x6F8EF2A901F4C2CBDA164BC9CDBF2DDD
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
0xBD02B41E99B553AC3647E30A95A2B08D
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
0x19F7CAE3EE65BF2D044FDE4B6BDBB560
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
0xF6D6099A2B16AC3ACC632778AD8DF740
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
0xD1FCC2C88A6FD16FCB54DCAA02D823FF
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
0x1463BAC5A1390D407EDEDAA22B8FEA71
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
0x09AD510ECF385DB93E1FF6B897320769
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
0xFAD657986491A22E1A8082669A57CCC9
Gateshead Hall.
0x5AF92C4A78535CF2CE00B4A120C3D49C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
0xC96A18D0CCBAD7EB538D203B761D24CF
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
0x9D9FA993FE73456C6D187B1B46568D81
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
0x79FE8F20570907A5DADFD4F4285F12B2
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
0x9AD9A50165ED4C69AF7E048E5D39BEF6
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
0x465E100EE3310E179AF16E8ECE196339
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
0x2BB4EEAC7CB10F08A48860EF468D5A92
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
0x4CD8A2D85D8796502F6E7997A425BFF3
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
0x05C173C05815A73E45CB5F7CCF1B5997
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
0xDFAA88BF0202F5B78C99F1C526A9B3C2
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
0xB6F00F9E0F8348438D667D90C0C44D54
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
0x8B6C1DD01C9ACB762F9A71D77A464FDC
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
0x4A1BF3E705EF61B0B19DAC11FD9DF5C1
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
0x82E81CB22F4C08F1060A5C3BC5527985
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
0x5012C990AAFD2DF239CBD1A82DBA66A1
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
0x9922A0DE9E5AC0F042130748AC8B96BF
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
0x801CEBAAB67B389ADD834D0C61870627
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
0x677A87D29E6DB8281597115D4417B0CC
accuracy.
0xAB7F59F839871C6AC6A537F6077B8434

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
0x05C1ECB11BB9845D4B20A55893B3F41A
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
0x01CC4A674523AF132E5D629CEBADACF7
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
0x0EEE778BD9E179DEB1F89D7F3DA62742
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
0xE55779BC0C19C7E612D9B2EAB4C34ED3
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
0x27011B8BDFDFC2FDA0AA75292E088B73
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
0x9E884B0E07FDF07E35C62C3126AFA068
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
0xEC5412C2FF0E1BA570B0FAC46D8B7D40
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
0xBF1B4B74CFFF5B455290CEB2677D4AD3
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
0x44C8ADB62F407A02B4E48389BB59BD45
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
0x5BA84356A72E3B0065C4CCB099E7056F
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
0xDAA5394C4ADE8AAEF75DE8EAF87A012D
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
0x13FB8A8450496A304074A21A1E0FBC14
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
0xB059EF730370FE136002D53EA15D1FB7
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
0xAEC489CDC6C12E91E032284A0E4CEFA6
frost.
0x729231FA729231FAD9C97F4AD832723B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
0x168BD98FFE3D0CDAD7819C07B7E65387
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
0xC67CD577C9F5807DBA62F1206600551A
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
0xAA2ED417E655CCED5AF764B0C8ECE644
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
0x94EDBAE803E3722F583E149F95CC5F55
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
0xD644D91F31434A7E25279CF6421EE0E6
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
0x30779408A597DD608ED97823EB39609E
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
0xE964FADF198433CE75ECCBFB3013AE7B
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
0x0637E7CE35543ADA0770ABF0D28608F6
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
0xD0ADE1BC3C4FBBCDB3CACC7F961DC772
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
0xCF38C8FBBB17CCC7AC611A27988A70DA
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
0xD5E978B55E9AEB1A0F23695975CC82BD
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
0x18827FC80A2D1A69C72BCF71D1C7CB5A
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
0xE6064D320895B7AB7490E9A376CCA571
nursery.
0x892A4AB57646F25351727D3A2803CA0A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
0x897CCBDE528B8E6946F7F975AC9E6248
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
0x6A3ADBD1D181A16E76AB111F6C940EDF
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
0x746F84233396ACAE390AD4EC9F9A0B82
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
0x5654A42574D9F8DF1B79CD423F05D73E
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
0x76A6AD7BB32F564B30F4AC054278E097

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
0x2064912E6357D6EAB31975376A7B58F4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
0xC503091FE8E55DF2249A7DFBEF904EFE
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
0x2A4FD66EE7EF196DBC92FEC3221369C3
window for?"
0x5AD193BBD7176711AFB77442AEB374FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
0xA47CB0B8877922E63B0BB0BB13DBE737
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
0xE5E21B86B23FED31EA2CD299793E41DB
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
0x04823E7413E161A99237561ED16002E4
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
0xFEAD78D3E413C1A0133D98237395A7BF
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
0xB646BC82215EDB1FFD20DF5141240746
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
0xE99A81222D07B43B991A17438364FFF9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
0x1CD4727BAC573BB3D15FB9108EA83900
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
0x4D3305011E1F18ACD73B2C5CDA99A077
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
0x24278244FAC0F8AA780CDBC4E4E97C68
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
0x65F36F29EFD1DE29926F04C16EF96987
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
0x7AA05D80A6D62E15DC5A078AC6E2C7DA
which it dismayed me to intrude.
0x57D9A8259C9782E8CDCFEA13E57C84D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
0x63EDA0EF664418AC94D08E351AA5C79A
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
0x75E3273366520052330E2BC4A114915E
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
0x5C1A2B27406DBFAF40B1F5B5AEE33A5B
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
0x3B176D75AB44EB93FD872EB8141B4BFC
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
0x19098E4A5C4DD948F0FC9B6EDE9DE73E
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
0x80D9E9E61CCDE0B25BA2D6BFF2C3FE8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
0xBD16CE8F3DE9181CAEDB9A708880062E
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
0x282778431191B324982BE1D8595E48D6
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
0x9E825CA9A133BB7DF783A3D1DEFFC49F
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
0x2D23B3518909B39890F5B5E01BFBCEC3
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
0x2F0842E7940DC5E2C2805940924A9276
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
0xC76C3C30CB47A735CA0429901AE5B124
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
0x56AA2F6C9C9B1A9F56A980F8004A07D9
by way of capital.
0x1BFF1BF0714D624AF6B6535EDB422E2F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
0xEEF15240CE919AB572F4A11457E16342
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
0x3FD4D2FBCF03AF340D7CDE2BA5435C92
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
0x6A8A7ABA9276CC62EC44F2CB17E8B062
you."
0x30492343304923433A030AD079A8FB96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
0xA08D479FAFD517FBA0E7590F64E4B437
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
0x3A7296C2B2299D1D297329EA75379A48
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
0x0B0D1800A192EB13509A5420CD8BE796
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
0x31CA626DAD9FFDC348FE30BB80CD4263

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ten years."
0x8299A1FA74DB5CDA24432479E6ED44D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
0xCDFE041B1227C82D83A2BCEF24F96B2D
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
0xDEE973C05803AEAB9C74731060788512

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane Eyre, sir."
0x133464A44DE22A4D367E191910431259

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
0xCDA203873B80426C914125F470F8DAE8
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
0xD511EDC6AB9C80FC5A66525FD8AB603D
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
0x6DD439A7C72B6066A07CE11F79A3FB97

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
0x283550E320C60798AD0C3DEDDE0FABC7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
0x01078A7D058A11633DAB9F20AA8FEF4A
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
0x5FFE4EFB3DE6303F6BCFE324F4F894BB
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
0xC0F28D3CBE0BAD0F5C70C1A2C5923EE0
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
0xC2FD2BEF3D66C6841E0588EB1F327B68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
0x54EE465B83F6D2A9F61F6192BC3AFE77
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
0xF8062395BDD98C9D5DCD5A31B0EF5923
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
0x3C0D614669B1C58465EAA7E22DA11B99

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
0x9019ECBDDB4949FBABE77813B1A2070E
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
0x0BE4428E283729A0FB8B268B87EE562D
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
0xCD02796FD8A56C0B946AF927BBE95DC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
0x32DAAF41ABF21726FA74DE8F406BDD62
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
0x92B830B2EB978A1104E5941B6A749A04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
0x3325E9D39CD98F2917ED6CB128A51255

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
0xEFC0F859D8CA7D15A4C62CBE73E663D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A pit full of fire."
0x64FBB9FCFD573D89549815E3B84D42F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
0x8B4C5AE1ACBF9A13CB734FD5D0D5AEAF
ever?"
0xBADF1F29BADF1F29C093C5C7290104A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir."
0xEAA5FB11047A71EB9CA51102A7DD511B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What must you do to avoid it?"
0x0858DFC2F643B3458F33B7D597936889

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
0xC0EDA3D868F9AA485ED3F41CCD974FD5
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
0x23061110FA2463915A30089777FF6E87

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
0x377FCD7E21CB0F77F4B944D620900FAC
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
0x3BAD1AA9ED6B8C33EA590C78B36C7668
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
0x60CA75B1B9057B1D92F26DD4A1681BDE
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
0x10C2D9500F051821A670AFA4F687C4A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
0x6068A09487AB2905C00D194B318B77CE
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
0xCA279BB40779CDF56F8CB242D39A9877
enough away.
0xB2BDF4DDA4B65BC17B1E287CC9B10149

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
0xB6C25D3D7BA72032B7444D56DE9740E9
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
0x5241E445402320FE5373D7EFA406BFFF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
0xBC8A1AA86DF281F714B1F726246B823F
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
0x8C8362F8A4FC531E371F1314C98FFC7A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
0x559F83E95DCB4847714BED77FE896ACB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you read your Bible?"
0xC22611DFD10DCE23D8AA949BF3D49202

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sometimes."
0x442A515C134647BC8826B7B629AF443E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
0xA1AE5C5948D4FBFF416E0BF5F9B310F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
0x7DA6BC6A12B7CB84907E5AF80C067FAF
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
0x720C16C8D1DFCC8ED4BF8EEFBCFC2B39
and Jonah."
0x7ABFA5D3B50DE9586EFCA644B18C1CB4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
0x823558337DF77F1C7FA40D7AC9F586A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir."
0xEAA5FB11047A71EB9CA51102A7DD511B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
0xA3A9297222B95B19444F9B3D9F068975
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
0xD9AA859DB7929E9D56D265D23AAA7284
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
0x284C9BB5B656D1439B25A4C3F4C89641
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
0xA55DE97D0C47E15BC4C934E9E579C9F7
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
0x0E73A9956B33B16EB2F4D2C86F0A850D
piety."
0xAD013A7BAD013A7BF6A70010C996F5F9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
0x8B02E3F798A76534C359AEBE71F42293

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
0x5AD6FA63AEECF8365ED5409FE4554490
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
0x59FE9B037C1AA972527CB926FAA2C4C9
give you a heart of flesh."
0x3E83B2D6A34076A23953C84D17E9DD94

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
0x5BCCC5EDE9F114E731CF143DF72B649A
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
0xCF772D43F57B81F4DDAF609D57B80852
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
0x02107536CDE04A0179610D5E84C6719F
conversation herself.
0xC341C02AFB3D454BA9A1E22E01F15867

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
0x43D05081DE516B1BE9D918A888805C15
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
0x5A283709549D966DF21B35571E83655B
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
0xCA0615D40FC1AAC8606609418A95A508
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
0x7AA2AFB3907442453B79D59DB1730ACB
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
0x3120E70815A4ABDF472C7F7FEACEE1C7
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
0xD3B66609E880400B8A58BA758661D03E
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
0x9015ECC3431010E9388C805ACED21492

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
0x323F07452D8A9103F761A68605913EBC
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
0x4BFAC5277B187C7776F0393DEBC5D0D9
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
0x8CFF41AEF3311D66868F401602809A94
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
0xAC76DB69C62E10338A6E48C9EADEE358
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
0x5DC17798E54517F7050F38E109C722D7
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
0x81346FBE0BE43665C28190F6E66DB42D
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
0xB6FC49F43091B46EF82C232CFDCDF238
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
0xA4683819D611B5079CDC86547ADA37E6
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
0xABF06F4E4534F46C41F08A26D239BEDD
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
0x192B0A556B9ED0D84C993330AB4BCC14

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
0x4A11D5C42A7B1579229741B850C032C1
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
0x5E2DE62C8F05E87E9DC9699B5F81DD30

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
0xD14C6F9AEDD3C962F188C0D2D6E4CF0C
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
0xE3A645A82B38747FFD1DF47D46B7978F
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
0x5FF1C88F90E198EB700DD0883FE24FC8
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
0xED9F508AFB3C252F060FE1CB4BCDC945

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
0x1B50C617A3758F4C88EDC9C73DFE5C30
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
0x8D2650042941ED7554F9E4748413077F
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
0x6A7872ECF3C4D1138331E3074445ADE6
Lowood."
0xBC4FC4D2C8E979B95242DC6C09827B00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
0x5C848036FEC8EFFBC1748CDAB9A7262A
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
0x1B30CF387C3B1DD7E402FFACF00360E9
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
0x519B73D01A57F05ADED551A2847400C8
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
0xCBBC6DD2ACB192F28B16089BDC6CE21C
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
0x60BDD88544D94F09AE9D15056B33DEDD
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
0xD009F7F3EE4EB42582116AF8D662DA1B
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
0x0A46D3558595B945DAB311AB7060A5FF
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
0x4E27EEC00AB920DB75C5B14B654C4DE0
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
0x26E19ABA35D1DC93B1F197197DEB161B
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
0xD835930E3CE11EDBAAB9550F0E64D9CB
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
0x95F32583EE3F1B52E4B15529550DB455
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
0x3D82C548DFDD6114289400420DA423E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
0x98C7AB85630645A6DC7D86FC7A9C2374
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
0xB996378246FAB0354663787C3DB5D7D2
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
0x4A0F84B8FD3F338A179ACB6491CD8DB8
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
0x46B66BA93DADF5941AA7D264421FBA66

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
0x6AFC7AE3A17478C204B155516FACD0ED
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
0x230B9999BBC85E24554AA65B34443834
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
0xE6BC372B19529365D3A5D132EB83310F
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
0xE299B90186CE24D946CC1030F2E206CC
inhabitants."
0xB7F5ED6AC7E6D0A2E50D5BF91F4EABC8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
0x362532365A11FEA12921FD8C338498AC
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
0x12513F0CB21ECC66644A9A14D818E61B
and prospects?"
0x380BE8F57C8D19A0984A815C32E75AC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
0x72B1B4E86E7DC9EB1140211190EE1A41
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
0x6A2E30CED23F51BE10AB25247CAEA082
of her election."
0x579F756434E35AB2FF7366E4A701A97D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
0x94A79F25EAF80873771A0603DB40DA21
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
0xB57525124F039CB3FDA2FF99112E497C
becoming too irksome."
0xA719A05E2BE12A37C34F4BD56A8797CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
0xDC685CBF8C30E76326F6A0873AF3E33D
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
0x4AB6DAAB3779B00661F8DC48B0198D5C
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
0x5E65756A3376FBE7160A9E7B67857F38
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
0x275FDA2932C8265D0BCB8FCD229ED9D6
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
0x9983ACF3D7BA32DAC44290B22DB2A4E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
0x30B7755BD151985A5299B307171635C1
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
0x1CD89EF12A895B67916EDF5FD9082EAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
0xCBFAC62D00522C6ED090C39328D06454
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
0x89C4907AB451444E723C15215DBBDFB9
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
0x062070BA46825E4E5495BDF737FDC7DD
falsehood and deceit.'"
0x162C64EE216D2A155399ACF9D84BCA42

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
0x07FC0D5E792C9741C1F95E5D836C61BE
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
0xC6F46D9FE32E829E2AB3CB46DE042B65

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
0x46EAE100BB5A6973A6D4F6F7BF22284A
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
0x22D3EEEBD71908E9CBFDBD1BDFAFDDD2
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
0xD8833431299100092BF56B069A159108
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
0xB6230754558E52BE73650053C181DE3D
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
0xD9104934A5250D1239A0D346F73C57F1
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
0x70BA9108CF52335AE1141632450D600B
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
0xC659F7AE74F6335521937E9EEE44C2D2
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
0x43A41F99315CEBDC38E8538B71C370B7
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
0x38A934AB79AA26DCCD27C6CA794F1F01
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
0x4B2D4B1A02AAB30A2554235CE3FD41E9
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
0x45D1084696E904B0526385F7C3838A42
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
0x19FBDC6659074A3D6AE0D8486EE01A76
handsome attire.
0xF5C36940D2BF603337AAB8682E904DD6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
0x131BDE73A7DA2306F96B75832B2FFEDA
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
0x917E32E2AE321463A02EF25FD050D8F3
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
0x3A06A8F03698DE452F88F9EC21329789
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
0xA41E56FB34409CECA515D09F4E392E81
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
0x8A7A9C5802EDCD6D486832AA544E21B5
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
0xCD10F9435232727386D8538534CE44D6
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
0x82E55FA734ACCF2DEC1AE26A49D0FCB1
fomented now within me.
0xE2A131834499761657EB88434C3AF3C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
0xFC988317E55BEB4466077792EF70FA7A
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
0xBA8C0FA588984160187C6E64610FDF58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
0x22A59319831A80C6EBF2FE7618B91E17
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
0x61BB42E2DDCC31DD80D5D90BCEF5FED9
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
0x1257967615AA1109E72BC0BF2CD8AF48
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
0x5832D231BCDB07D990719102D94002F2
to her.
0xA8010974A80109749EFFB5039E276549

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
0xADA5CF06D5C62B8335DEB0E3588242C1
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
0x63D8E3F68E067EE72940A90A16D3C01B
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
0x0F2D9402BC1B2C3D3564FF61C7683A1A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
0x1852735F87BFB7FAB021FD6C9F5231D4
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
0x3C46A9C342F8EFD500DEA73D9EAAE9F4
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
0x1754956309860EF1B88920C81E7E0F6E
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
0x38EF2E618F35BAA812659989E3A0FCE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
0x09D162A6E458303A6F3AC72946207026
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
0x7DF5075D557C64401317CC872F054931

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
0xD699757CEFCABA5A35C34598ADC2B427
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
0xEB4F7B0C24B6F2C928D2C2A9278724FA
used to a child.
0x42A7E4729F5144CB92FC7FFEC818F288

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
0x60F1E4491E6FF70E5CB3887504604DD5
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
0x94779ACCA2C1AD0BA479CCCC7FA5103A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
0x83EE85DC5CEB462DB906099543989FCB
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
0xCC1DD4F3D7F998E7D1323C8740DB45C6
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
0x47A7AAF806D7AC6C3E891CBDF0FCDCB7
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
0xB87CDC81FB30E02CA9C6A61E6E03866F
miserable cruelty."
0xAC6B77BF7A6A7D05D50FB715CB70EE0F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
0x4999937CA441CF41A4063C0B8A01E812

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
0xB57E0AFFE69486336E0DD2DCA25EDDCA
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
0xE8FB7026F561D033AEA0B1D57126E7CF
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
0x0A6C0C81C1D92970AE09D07CA4D5E327
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
0x88AFC0F59AF621BC0CF63C2CD42BD5B5
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
0xB1D36501B3770E3E55B46AF96B1A8C09
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
0xC63FB49DB3364FFCEB3669649D554F2C
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
0x67977CA77BC40426C9ED422A44189A4F
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
0xE4F7D17561B5F6B7E0646B430A36E070
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
0x1E27A4CAA09BD09268E74BFF0039C51E
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
0x30437819B0AD6CAF050D2E2F379B2BF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
0xFF4092F13D8946C91780515B398EDC22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
0xB3FF4BF635FC267130855E75766DBB8B
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
0x224C84D47BFA9DA6913C65EE50DC765C
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
0x2E9F4D297D24615DFF9CBF53302A28B8
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
0x0E4B91F4BA989B7930783114D2B89EE3
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
0x253AB6E5476ABEC8FFEF8E83F2C97188
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
0x1D601CCFA52F3EA414A73D46B394778D
would cry.
0xDE76D4999D8BDE804C5D6D17478ACDDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
0x778CD2A098F2038EA17DE1B7F2F502A8
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
0x10BB5A7DD0485E3FC229CC6BE7047CE3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Mrs. Reed."
0x61533C3771BA99B639D5924A7698E961

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
0xE53D9A1682D012F87EEDE912B0DAEDCD
your friend."
0xE8D1F36FBC628305833315E23EA91F82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
0x0B4188D592484140DCF773E92D302270
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
0x8D056279101A5349F18D01691AB1A0D2
you have done."
0x7973096E5421D48BFE645D772B0C0B2F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
0x33DD523FC0283EFF35A33E2C0C88076C
their faults."
0x46BB9EAE13E6EFF0B98CDDE62AA2EA8B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
0x3E1369DD828F3A46F573C2B2CC1F1FF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
0x10369E8F86ABEBCB58DA947E1C8A4532
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
0xCD795D6BB1AC86D37518A41D3C3C7063

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
0x71A651CD8F57DE4E2DC8DEC7006AFD19
Reed, for I hate to live here."
0xEF74A8110E72D8BFC9F7B6FD69DC5D95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
0x1EC9D8FA0BA65F7860A1B6D0445DC7B0
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
0xBCD74AF7CD6D457B4B8C5F7E552856A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
0x4C11A08343F1299C450F6DE882403F35
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
0xD0131912CCE9D8157FF489103FD032E9
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
0xDD79CD6194D1D141014ED3BAB43E278C
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
0xCAAEB86F7A7BC110293092C5341C0F1F
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
0xEC4A5A892DBA6D1ED065473C8B7752C8
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
0xBADB6B54B399F764019CCE2D2DF1FA2B
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
0x9BFDEFBD1D8B64F3E1F30ABFEA50F1FB
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
0xBDA80437BA5A41794E5B09D68106C3E4
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
0x2A7E6C415C40008671981556AF79092D
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
0x85AE48FD9D85A9CF81142277638FF9EC
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
0x9743C2211404B9B9451C7122FCAD6C4D
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
0xEF54B27619189A1636714DDB56DDD9CD
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
0x63B53961A1EC4B8372E2941A41D5A489
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
0x545C41B618F88DD4CF170B8D03532FE2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
0x2CC57C56CA62FA5009F57FA3A96CB8D2
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
0xEB54CB142DD578F08647D69E80D57B20
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
0xFFE0CC87DC27487F8655C7FF4C18DD3A
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
0x2A157A7F3C73D06C6A765D4069F9B261
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
0x60A28FF2823E029B0A8C684A1AD7554D
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
0x9538DD701510206CE29343147A4BF0B6
of my nature.
0xF60F046559026EDF3143834B0FECF725

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
0x93238D27BF7D0B331095812746565C1D
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
0x8C89BE3E192895299358149782DF8535
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
0xE2864E9035FA0545D6F276EDF016A6F9
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
0x119A79506FF32D32FD79AD54DABA4DBA
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
0x8B22B799DDD9DD438244710C53A9A4E3
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
0x0D4648671F57B86A0134F687A2A0543E
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
0x9E99AE570974A0DBBF9B8D66BB0480F6
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
0x5BC87F5B44F6149A3BADEA02A7CACF75
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
0xA99D1BD6A994FF1DFA32637DCAE9DD67
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
0xFD5DCBF37C12CC7CCC8CABB72F914471
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
0x0B9B8AD303C617E42CCD65D60F060C64
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
0xBC22E3FFF21DF384222F4EDB10572FF6
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
0x6A105C8865A5B967CF9AE779DFE83EA6
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
0x3EE413E6B3B5987DED0A75C0F681D766
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
0xE686673CEBFBBFD9EBF3DEB9E453AB04
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
0x4DAEED928B6DE1B6F3912729C28D2071
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
0x6C9070C056F8A226FA80131A6BF1E83D
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
0x6EFFF6033CF0450F0A79DE0EB51C72BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
0xBA523799FD2A94C113D2FD42EE2D6E28
to lunch!"
0x3D0E8E0A36E70810736BFD85A4BA497F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
0xC195375DD0BA329D0A2B008B1F3105CD
came tripping down the path.
0xA670F650CD673D2276DC57E08C3C30AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
0x2BA50297210616ED9183B1FFC13CBCAE
called?"
0xDB4284B935E00155D7F52E7E711F46AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
0xD55F7CF5C5C8E457053CF7CA3B2F1475
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
0xA31BA5417789F3AEA35F51DB94EEB75D
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
0x6C10DD8ED9489F0AD7641AFACC73BA61
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
0x326D3505A4383417BF261EEE5F66D9BF
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
0xCFA581D79A3CAF4A5B267BD59C5F9C48
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
0x0DD8AE1585BEFE2E4017B71E77072749

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
0x79E3E505328CB530059A901627802340
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
0x09155EEDB971DFCD31CDF7965B2704B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
0xD5F55F899C45582D4BBC53A838060AD0
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
0x78E8DF30133A4D12E145B4C1BA1ED6B6
suppose?"
0xCD8A621CF1D02C066A350AFA257A0355

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I nodded.
0x84D999D6623F614DC82EF2CC8571B038

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
0x33AC8783C0B0D5C7BAB3C30D47DF17CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
0x3F9728C994E8015A364C81FE106E5F67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
0xA8F078CEB11AD4C036FE3C6CEFD540F0
be bolder."
0x622A2C817B05190E5007B2DBB1C9E59C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What! to get more knocks?"
0x93CA9FF55BB0D0861C505AB4F22C8BAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
0x10A1D4554590FAA576C7AF3D85AF1D05
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
0x03ED1852A4E799D8D86B4C432C9C23BD
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
0x712F7D3D228D0543BD05CD94E9F2B140
for you."
0xCD72A814ED4A4B2021C607164A68952E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
0xA50583F05934DFEA9D2F54FCCDF26259

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
0xB4F7721850B3547C9B982940759F39F0
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
0xE4121A8FFC6B87C8A1FDA10A035F65A2
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
0x7ED01DA461DB7A89533FEF8F7B4704A3
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
0x838142F17C369465868DD81E9283FCFD
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
0xE4B63D12FBD845A3EE1AB8CE235B803C
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
0xA184F8362C37A7286D5E62C07025945C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
0x79F4C507B88708D35E4CC9D98B707FEB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
0x79C2FC60C86DD07A0A8FEBAD78A5C54C
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
0xF964737F5F7FFD2A7753F8EEBA97B818
provoking."
0xB87049333BACE3745E82F35624C9F377

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
0xABAFB5C89F5A24427FC3AD8671422CC0
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
0x0B9A16A329E75E71A013DA87805564D6
dread."
0xE440F9A5E440F9A5FB080BDADB5458EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
0x17F9232FDB687E4A8D3C0332C3761751

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"As you do, Bessie?"
0x9C75EE9B2B25CA699C4547DB373B6A52

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
0x36D35BDF42554C05554153ED07AF3D57
others."
0xB782F879018628E0CD05EA22FF93243F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You don't show it."
0xECD69F29247AA5BE3B47528AF7A192F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
0xA264236CBD9735F0D1E06190E6B5B706
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
0x1B331C89EA984F4F0770B6852934D8A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
0xE71542FC6698FA7E1E8ED0118CC6355E
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
0x42359B6B47FDB344D071758ADB59E499
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
0x06E3C805BB627FB06F38AEAEC4D1E920

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
0x0A477CFA8612F9F5A185CE612B4D6956

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
0x247CF0E9002D2B22D2D19FAD85904652

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
0x9C3B268E5758D8F5C8C59719009564C8
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
0x32766AD8A808EE03DD6AC1E50133BF49
you'd _rather_ not."
0x61A2BFEFC06E152F274424E62EF28648

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
0x42B47295B3AB4651B6BF30C0B721A17E
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
0xBAA20B10906CAFF7268924F8CB097965
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
0xD1EB0387D9A28E9CEB7298AA6F37812D
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
0xBCC186279A5A986F3A14FF61E06374E3
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.

CHAPTER V
0xEE80E85931D85A565C032252AF3BFBA3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
0x2C0E0025D16904DF7340B1F7E399469F
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
0xB733024ED28D462EB72B7FC81874ABE6
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
0x24E372BE0CDFD6AFC39EC240981CAF79
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
0x26716EA31A89298EEA52F33E97A836C2
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
0xA3A1F605EC40025E832165D728EEBCAB
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
0xC8982F5174A9F5FBF095F6CBA1F1A442
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
0x91A5A72B148C7E2D3007758597AA10A1
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
0x4D75814C608BFC9135D57BD46F9A2BBD
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
0xB0D17975AE99E58FF47308C9AC73275B
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
0xFED58E1F7E84F94E0180531ACB14AB9C
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
0x5C5EF9D380C93C2048D309998FB186AB
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
0x37F1A1A8305BDC4140C0EF52BB9C5C54
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
0xFD814467FC1DAE19B8056E4D4468179C
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
0xCC6253A80AB4186E0E896EB55E54317A
bye?"
0x27AD9A1A27AD9A1AC88616BDE1E00F22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
0xEB1F0B8A88A913E3595F25E32D1FD803
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
0xDA0308C84750C980E3F779B388ED24AC
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
0x1537501F962868B747B63F20F91729AD
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
0x90C32933213645BE1C1C61277852F449

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What did you say, Miss?"
0xC1351EB19D7AAD2A311BD5567C19D435

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
0xD5BE1C90FC9539C13A7EEFFD8AF240D1
the wall."
0x224C5B712657E2FB916214C60F4D9776

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
0x4BF72614016484137F9DA2591DB93572

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
0x625449F0B16791101F64EDC62DC1B819
been my foe."
0x76238846BF2F13016F4C18D1BF04740D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
0xD27155E4E16F7C4A9E29AD4FDAF536E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
0xBCF4BA982807F0081BC7324B5C86201E
out at the front door.
0x93EC5E5B98F38760CEEFF64A97838275

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
0xEFF35ADAFEC1A38955D54721451CEA24
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
0xBB14FAB2981006E74C04ADBFAC5A8A59
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
0x819BE4BABCEC5C6E15816569EB2473A0
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
0x2E209A711CF09A45159A8ECEB625CBF4
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
0x6BDBE1B11F036647F4BB9C90D363A928
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
0x50C542082BB80378517F7A37F94E2181
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
0xC5B71802A7A6429778EFB462FCB38BA1
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
0xEFC0DD55CEAE129B58EC7B37048EE6C7
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
0x53D0C5A3D7A4ECD9F4DC45D29188D347

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
0xC27935270C2F25DE726F120D109463C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And how far is it?"
0x0F39E5EBDC0CFC09D2D1C6098C563D4D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fifty miles."
0x827D148A33F504520CFCF25CD10F5EDD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
0xAD529186EA21CF5F43B7DDBCAC6AE4C3
alone."
0xFEB86AFAFEB86AFA77B3ADB1FBE14C51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
0x9D366D452FE2EB6D8BD14F8140E58997
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
0x1664C7D38B0B93874AFE49BF8F82BD75
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
0xD38EB4BF3B58481447208F6D1564B107
with kisses.
0x1D86935DC805E25B032F2AEB101B3DF7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
0x0A19EA56059B48533B42FEC8FD63302F
me into the inside.
0x675B5D69732E25ADAAAAE24DC129FC72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
0xEBFBDED59AD1EDA122E45CDCE07DFB56
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
0xC8CA6E397BC2B69D7F2C63F4D57AB00C
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
0xDA039CA6825255894EC880046F4AEA81
mysterious regions.
0x90C2145961F2AFD25F6FB8C6CA8528BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
0xEF1E82822D89DAF4F642CD157740CBEC
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
0x3D365EC0BC5E641E2DE21327BB0672DC
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
0x2C2098C7B7216B4E513860C25B2E9A89
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
0x603711BD10FE56738A46C7A833DFF417
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
0xF404555EEE22A500C720E6688349D80E
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
0x6C19EC79D838987334BEF10349BF7FA6
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
0x55484712FCECFDF339AE37BC0CBF5401
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
0xAB2371CC278FDB4780E5E378623BFB16
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
0x5D5EBB562B50477FCD01A080D02B5D8F
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
0xAF6DC6B19D6192462BB63EE30C12F298
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
0x1186DD9F4687A6179FAE893F87EBF466
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
0x9F1B4ACABE02A7D5A94377B448D86D69
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
0xF828C1273B123B5D886EB254E1E82FC7
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
0xD4AD885E0E3708BD41284E835E263BFD
"stony street" of L-.
0x3598E2C68083007A00EC8D8E4AC79440

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
0x3210A4247ABD1C48EDD0259327C9F2D2
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
0xF0066FB349787468C853DF62C9DB7BCC
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
0x15653C06ED8BE612CD4A3091A08D595A
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
0x393A566167A1D899B2EF6755922847F5
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
0x89727DEDB1B7DFB5F164C05603334F6B
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
0xAE48737BC79E3E110301AD651D6B09BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
0x4B8EE963191106F31CC7A9AC7BA8EE16
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
0x38071FB910CC8499984BB207C84F1D1E
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
0xB41594D21EF0C1E8F9A24F3D1E4146C6
by the light of the lamps.
0xB0EEE6813AA85043D6C40C92EDAF497A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
0xE06856240ABAE67180E10B018B95E20A
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
0x482601982CE66E68B634D8B3ED2A5CCA
instantly drove away.
0xB341701362D74BBAB75F6DDBC1635793

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
0x093373A10C45E74AD9E3E4E6F95BC88C
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
0x5D1651C53D678D34A97A1CDAE199A2D2
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
0x04157E548DD8B8BA272A231025E5B1DD
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
0x239A29C8C1160189EFE12C2D15447E48
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
0x70D2EE81BCE2714B682EC219369F17F3
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
0x462978D121BA1A11A66E6EB63AAC63F2
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
0xA250B9AAD25C16076586E08828B6A352
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
0xD52A9C453DEA0B97F52BF13758D26316
with a fire, where she left me alone.
0x5656A071353AC41CF7EA0653BE7DA7CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
0x1ED13D48444D938A5F7D2A6578C4F465
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
0xA4457DB6399544C6C98277145C057B05
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
0xDF5EB4AE9755FF13C8BBDAD66BCDDBED
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
0x8B594BAC13C21C538E02458BE0F96DFB
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
0x9587236788AF6B2AB04DEF426B6F56D3
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
0x05D6A990F5417814941A19BEC828CD18
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
0x3E22BF9D32B768171E8D4E6348D470E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
0xB442DAE79B0010FBBB51338940987B92
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
0xC10E5316F1303BF0BE9B0716A2271362
grave, her bearing erect.
0xD48C830DA503CAA0E497AA694EA41D67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
0x0C582CDEB16533276E51B23B766AE973
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
0xA8CE845A3C17C891EF047BE41A4317D3
then further added--
0x111E6F6ED64C1CCBB6E7D5375C4E701A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
0x3AA3227DB324BFD698C509D0B9F8B5EE
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
0x28234161B76CA4BBADA8E5628369FC1F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A little, ma'am."
0x769E734977F9BDBA68DB05C0E497B1AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
0x5A45F8B5A664E813DB89795F3A4F2529
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
0xF12B9DCE1FE7CDCC214F692576CE942D
come to school, my little girl?"
0x38A9908E76CC2C3B1FF68612746F5413

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
0x76E081352DF42767B2FD2F1B9665124A
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
0x66D75D3C18881178267132F489CFFC9C
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
0x945274F13ECAE3BA2ACDDB794ECED6CD
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
0x34F55D42383006FB7BC7EBE3A0EB42F1
me along with Miss Miller.
0xB2D6233F10E921FA58D07CD949B2BA36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
0xAABC2179594DBDC37620FDC89F69C2EA
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
0xD8A533E9C6545432A6747ACE0D594D89
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
0x9AE12E19A50FE9620A2BD7FCFD147DDC
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
0xEFD3A831E2D8F3EA40144CD3DB7798E6
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
0x5CA82767751DF34EF664E52D3514376B
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
0x12EDFF19A2CFFDD5608F9317B9919F06
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
0x56B009B97CF83447928079C5A5CEF86D
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
0x214E9FDA8240ECF307A6FD0674E91989
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
0x352E8BF1E4EB2E6B9DC084EBAE67FF22
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
0x44D5820F56681DFA6D0D86C87136D931
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
0x87FC50F02982FA0D7B2D88F556845D40
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
0x7B42013EA07BBB648D307A2F84B1AF07
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
0x0B7D1CF05F59B321C3FF52A5859CA93A
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
0xE16902CC18B32D2BE190883799C126C5
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
0x36F0251D2BA5DCE30D49ED624A8FF1E7
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
0x986D298080F9BFB741A1BC535DF7F318
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
0x4AB458D019F5BE7C5DC57334F28D5A6F
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
0x8D0E0B9E600EBC6CC5EBF69F13BF9EBE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
0x3D481F3ED06410CFAAD862479E4436D3
to the top of the long room she cried out--
0xD1731874E000EFEC3710F9D4BB129A0A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
0xB864BCE974597164F57D7E918BF5B276

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
0xAA9DBE0D5ADA2D19AC52E5306DB377F1
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
0x233E43DFD323F42736CAEEFDB4CC356A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
0xC6C6CF133928786F38C5D40789134ABF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
0x63519C51A76445CD92BF10D3B6770743
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
0x292E18302E659EFD0950585BF5C36BC9
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
0x650237A41BE85ADED133E7DE20CBC30D
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
0x926485185E4480615E00CECC6A6BB98F
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
0x949433C5F7367188D32276FDC633EDDC
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
0x0AB91FCA128DF872521B36BF91ED31D9
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
0x9FEAB154E511E0B773A4A4E11A0DF495

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
0x4C7BA365F44E3F78F25109DD40C4114B
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
0xBD9D3849BFFD26FCD200C788E8CB05FC
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
0x6B002520C2DC3F3519E6D200BCB1F8E6
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
0x5F1E42A50416553542EE890C2FF209B1
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
0xC483E9A5904C351A59549E98D5AE6FF1
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
0xEC9C4F89B78D74B66E7174BDD3DA2634
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
0x05CDED96A6D1A1D9B1CF23E270970C27
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
0xA5430ED1FC6B7F39A4286F11CF77B43F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
0xD0FAC093A661A760B81694E8662FAAE5
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
0x249E08B714F3F9556BE0F2FC4D58FA13
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
0x29D284953F2A951880B8002187494729
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
0x1228A05D6BED87C62C61F65DACF90D03
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
0x6577198FD8C19BC9459972CF3611ED41
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
0xAD8DE554286E117E475016FB4A49D62C
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
0xA5CEFE8147276488098F07A8C491108F
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
0x47181357A0C7DEAE521FBC50A0B45C6D
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
0x17B789BE73D30ABC3AD56E42E7DC8D48
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
0x820BCE1A805EEE0926DE80303EEB8E66
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
0x148F71F1D4882FC52543FA930B950207
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
0x4E6D5A592CB7BAF160BA767EA2F2613A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Form classes!"
0x843D3EACF6183E5776E4F0D855701AAE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
0x5A46E86C527941B5384026A3EF7A1B4B
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
0x6A8FB35798223B81FDBF1862EB62BF15
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
0xB17738FF666557F28E4BC526BC967F70
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
0xCE7AD1FD7227A8BF74C04180C580783E
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
0xAF1576DBA773A86C57030007FF54454E
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
0xB2D5167652F2A673C5FC77477D0E6F20
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
0x771EA4D9668B0015ABDB580445A9EBD9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
0x6A1F5D5C72C99127DC0DFC98BCC12DD5
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
0x7E0AEF0650B583F058508C641C2DD568
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
0xF9FA35AC843CD3DA58EDBFF303B3F15D
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
0xD88BB77590412CF98F0C3BA4E7D6FF9A
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
0x28961D8D8ED69451AF20C093AD319F85

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
0xCBC3793BD3F703C35583B9A390CA380C
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
0x9BB29F5B3EE2D81611DF9A46E37DA818
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
0x57BCD2413C065DD5EC43FC735599F7A1
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
0x5CF186AEA33DF82EF95DF23627FF0645
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
0xD88972F24DF008ADE2E5D27AE98B0170
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
0xA4021383DE9447B19BCC5B525FF26CD4
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
0x7526D0B4C44598EA3CA71467F3278F81
little the day before.
0x43B96CAF46A2D98CD0DC94EA520267B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
0xF14894D052FBE0410E2F7CA85F31FF34
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
0x0C6AE77FD24825DD4C4ECB6E4F594DF5
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
0xE0FD8FE235FE563DB0339DFA2E2C00D3
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
0xA10A230F77530F81413C7A2AF1BA0224
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
0xD9FDEB45CC68C77FE60CE430D0B79ED2
the first class, rose the whispered words--
0x39A489EC1050040C03EFE17DBCE59E24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
0xF75015AF3AFD7D58FF1CEC3C32381CC2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
0x1FE450E12ACF1B346EB1EA993B8464AC
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
0x7B24C4F13651536107990B678803FAF5
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
0xB5913B742C2A0804FC34A8368BE4581E
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
0xA9C17A505A122847567B02DBDFE0F1F2
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
0x9153120B06EB46B4383D7C04AE9CF640
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
0x6CEDDFF58935E1832CCFCB18A7D21A2F
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
0x17853037C58705D7E5153B20846E117D
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
0x05387D7D91E09C3E353100B881094D96
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
0xA8625B75B3CABFE2C1ED6EBE56BE8C37
the meal began.
0x1EB519DF7073597AF1B2435D5B65B0E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
0xA43143CCE2585531DF2A0FF57B8FDEC2
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
0x369631ED66427DCDE0C4C1FA2220676D
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
0x3F2F49CD74902C03A184D9CC6EB12AE8
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
0x0B4EC0F917B8BB1941725EE31AA4DA85
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
0x2CA1640E5ED55C0A92E5B9ACA5163731
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
0x88C401A0F866AEBED88868479ED80DA0
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
0xD40584D68FE441921876874F5A00182D
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
0x1BFCC676628FF90281936D94E16E0FEA
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
0xACACC35C99850BC131B0A000C51CC258
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
0x47E579063721A72952737D7E866031AA
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
0x5B1919C505E61CBDCD36818FF08BD3EC
them, the stout one, whispered--
0x1FBC8571620C59ECBFE6B24D3B920832

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
0x6B2201C7C8AAD8665DF48A6650CA2F58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
0x33040F4C904711F54276A0F6DF1DCF57
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
0x9986D253B5BA2511E556850EE34B636D
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
0xC082AEE0544D84E9510A0951F33ED8A6
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
0xBF8C68E79A236ACBED4925EE8445152A
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
0xCFE7135B77FC644A9642DD830720DE08
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
0x93EDA7DA302AACB7DD1ACDF090C5D551
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
0xE24C4BF50858F6B744CE5F2A0E39B607
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
0xB6B62FEDB191EF0A6A06ECA46D8724C6
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
0x70C7CE0C5578D99DAC41BFD1773DE887
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
0x56F5D45A107B2EC057D702CCDCE48E99

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
0xF173BAB2B2CD574847CF78C41DBC5446
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
0xBF1FD16A098A9A1C09EC86DF77814B9C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Silence!  To your seats!"
0xBBFB87E7233B177782755EE74723032A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
0x7DB05D418E8F5303FBBA74CA3977833B
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
0x3F9A9F1432D56CA652DF11FAD2AAD531
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
0xA31B0A14F0D53D34B9DD3E4B92EAC557
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
0x1035BF8A61247ACB61F8776319022C33
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
0xEB07AD2360E5B36C109BEB8822F23652
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
0xDA618EB04DAD242A38F4E915348FC4B1
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
0x203EC9F6EC3DA0A3833CCB5495D21204
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
0x6C60CF08D588186989A6809447B54C97
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
0x73454828464981C2FB1CA464C4E4235D
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
0xAFFE9ECB22CEB2F8B9E430DFDAD1155D
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
0x7CB814AE0D3948F28D722BC1A7D31ADB
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
0xED07471F065B34A1254861886F9C834B
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
0x78121306226CB7ACE1AE4731183565B5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
0x423AC070440E889F0959E1835290B670
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
0xDB21B16EB4341008555151085228F577
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
0x727CC30BB13F6CE194F62DC5C6516256
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
0xC6E6DDCE8E88216092B4479780BBC5A5
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
0x421EA7DB69D0FDACFBB814DC4BC0332E
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
0x6A66AD9A1CFDBB42B3BC5524EF210D40

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
0x778DC4F4725587CACA6ACCC5888EE901
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
0x70A5BAEE0A845D2E0259A54CDF7F0297
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
0x324F0677C9198CCCD7005FDD2B0CD6E7
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
0x8241A9A6696EE497AA4E7F055BA44D5D
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
0x38E084E403A61D840380533EB3D1C453
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
0x04BBB0A136B9A7BCDCADA25F54DC4977
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
0x1110999AC4867FEC652DFBCDE648F0B8
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
0x54E9E72BD94D961B7E5E50F882E8B4BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
0x6C6D9174B9C9CE233B188FDBC785C6D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
0x7B2AF1884CB740549D1E8D1DA6261DBC
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
0xCD057C15F47216999EE657568105C448
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
0x1D0DB0219863B760F06899F10D8387EE
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
0x02A2106DFA30ACCB3153B82E60AC2DF2
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
0x777E3C7395829AD9B4C0D9862784AD78
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
0x9EBEC5937F7E47C121A2CDC224BA4B84
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
0x521B027B4F20642C0932665C4B5E85E7
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
0x5FD71BB1260F1B1FCD4BEB5A9342C4D3
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
0xEB4EA77C9B3FFC11F19E5CFF23D51629
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
0x11BAAF21AFDF214D10AA4BEEDA77E2D0
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
0x8E4B54B6EE3E6F79EBB2ED09831FECC2
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
0xF1756EF144F0D924A78C1BA0E9BA9A75
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
0xF8FD2154A5E9AADFBFEE7B0B9CCF529C
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
0xA418E8EE015A89B581F659FD9F331D55
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
0x4EF0CA30D9B0DF4FF34E2BB5BAD6AE39
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
0xCE209BFEA1445C481E32554769227042

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
0xC84907E01AAEE6FBC29EEBA889BC1280
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
0x77B14FA9896A58452F0BC61A848B84B4
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
0x8DC5BB47E8A119FE3ABEECE685CE33EF
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
0x48F19050CFD96AA2F9CD30FB40C65DFA
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
0x42CA08D6BDBD889A0C6E27998157056B
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
0x9B1653B048CC982DC1B2E489713464FA
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
0x1081FF7D85AB5895E586333DFA305BCA
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
0xAF4EED54F76D38B3F3EF33107B043C90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
0x9703B9F985F98E5776665677D500C137

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
0x999A3705179E3ACB6279CABC8C27A952
sank at her voice.  She went on--
0x1597CFDAB3C357A064849A8FD871B424

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
0x9022B2BF6DADCB9110C3EC27D7BB1840
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
0x7C0B67C04A6AF351A4C435CC52D0F92E
to all."
0x610B72645CFEEC43970A08BE8FEFA393

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
0x13E07B82DC33BA362189B11E7C685897

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
0x37825C72B8D4FE0957C1F1DF0B3EC71C
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
0x664414542D08FA06F42A0D6340D00944

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
0x8D6603532714CFBA1A6FD062BA5FE673
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
0xD5800A38A697B9C9D509F808DAAD95FB
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
0xB117A06633B40B3990FF35F0AA41213A
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
0x2B542B6602D93B4A9EA9E08CEDBB6A26
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
0x62BDA527729FAE92C89A201A6FDCFBE5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
0x88BB04601B4CEF7C8D6EB3CEBE929D15
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
0xF3126394E43259873BD8EDD820BADAC9
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
0x26ADC684FF77266457A91953A515674E
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
0x27B1ABC70D121F47D26449E6B2AACF93
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
0xECF58AED435C752B9BF148DA9BE2B9E1
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
0x9C328BD0EA6FDF04A69A5D4A9273A4B5
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
0x4337479F1F388135E8B56ED1113EA85A
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
0xA2A8258FB859E00C1EB1CABC92CFC4D5
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
0x8FA658069FFF4769B4864C285768012B
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
0x5C60C2B96A624F225E5DEF775FDF851E
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
0xA5A49800600687A0D2570729CD9CD54D
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
0x98EA4470BB514617654EAB8171C162C5
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
0x603D4455961C9916D7BED876BBE6A28E
hollow cough.
0xBE61B85B69E03E1C15F106A41DE1AD1F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
0x47B50AEBD79EDD07276E0A410B476065
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
0x0B2D0F01163E83727FEFABD42E0B736E
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
0x057E83894E1B0372A68F12FDB6486921
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
0xFCDE801D4B54362D9F1A1216D0A05610
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
0xC72EEAF8A2068C1E68E569D9C22641E2
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
0xFCEAACA76E51FB52D4C5F436D9237703
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
0xFDBFA5751828CC4147225D9CDD9EA618
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
0x3402AFDB0DE1E95BDD46D4BD6B1688B4
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
0xF91CB75974AD9C8AD6CA8E10ED4DEB7E
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
0x41A43C21773F338299E02EF32E0E29BE
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed

grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
0x765CA222195652313088F8A7F6D32D25
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
0x19F601F4930E1C0D3E50E71DB62EEA8C
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
0xB12CC41EA899F5F8618C000324F9B297
this inscription:--
0x138FEA36F28497A567DE99CEB4B23C23

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
0xFFF158C843F82FADE9B3148F518808D9
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
0xE234301969339DCAD660EA4CD703FC3D

0xCB994673B7E5CE95E4882C99CC310BBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
0x4B5706DCDAEF3643ECE60C852CB2F1FF
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
0xFB530E1CECCD8B3F2DF1AAB3F6403624
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
0x2D338003A1627B3572F2133646CC9952
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
0xA2DFAA73A694F2085F109A232BE156D6
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
0x4FDFFB766BFC53E451469AEBD6E4AF4E
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
0x643F6D23F0AF51C4E070E1FAFEF868E0
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
0x5D3051796E0043FB83E8C5D4C9586F7B
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
0xA4FEB9F991B430821C0064BB3425367E
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
0xFCD797C2D949691759568FB65EDE6C76
I said to her directly--
0xCAF817A3F956ECE3416E37B24395FFAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
0x50877A843F92EA02FB4079426E4D6425
her to lend it to me some day.
0xFEA9F24617A4149F47BA7C61E4AD9699

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
0x739004A939C8FBAF8C4C72396D7E07CF
she examined me.
0x775C7CEF60BA19BDB02443F041B4ED9B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
0x490D4E95D90D6E17A476E19FD7CC6468
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
0x68E950E08E4267D9DB87156A7CEA4549
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
0xCD40F73928273CBF8AC0882743455B8A
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
0x053F2CE59063C2AC56435075DE5F3D6C
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
0x9E229DC5900A7FF9E82B26D5740E0E87
or substantial.
0x07BA8BC57126DC360EC743CFE210E8D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
0xBA67474AFAB0F95CCEDFC288C83CE7F9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
0x5E64F836D41D3B43D893E06BF7CDE0DE
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
0x2293F8FA7B5DD0243D2D401CFF7AFC02
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
0x9F585FD4AFD64C6F77981D018625C5A2
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
0x20ED6784ABFB620F016376B031247886
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
0xF1D6C20E9DA89A7752ED0CFB36C5659D
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
0xC1BA2019580F790760DDB0E991947D2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
0x395CA970531F02EE52FABAF0B8997CB0
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
0xE28BA4111740B68902FE0AC64B6A56B9
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
0xFA2C7700132EDD09B19ECAAD4E3F8850
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
0xE0F49AACB8F91EF8F86ED98AE3B00D45
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
0x31A326E5356B87BFB5545F5BC0EA1DAA
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
0xE1D2720912E143A6656DBE67CDBC9BB5
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
0x93735B98F3CCC6C5DA559F6E5A81CC8F
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
0x30567482C50209F910BE4BB8E4308948
day's fare would be like this.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
0x6AF7F81E42963BEFFAEF22368B33509F
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
0x4DCB68C0A9353B8729AC942665DE84AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
0x0E2593F04BBED37393367FEA0A94834C
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
0x0BA4FF2FC6A0CDAEA534577B97B2626F
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
0x1959610910DBC4C3FC6BA76B2651626F
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
0x6567B499F194ADDBF5A199A9D3620FD1
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
0x99F1953015279C27E270AEEE7B75BF69
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
0x1F21092827D52B5B45DAD4C2B325CF46
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
0x891EFFF773E5F5A691B4720A6A7323FB
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
0xA89A07B414F3EE636F3556005DE9A124
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
0x1ECB20674C5A2C2B55239F8B0CD7C39E
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
0x73278233B0A6A08FA6529E9B5A5E9233
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
0x21A68EE56E9B55F38CC1A14DA4A67EC9
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
0x9265C32ABE019B4BA4FE5FEEAF2E3722
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
0xF2B3320940FB7C69AEBA48B24016B888
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
0x8B55869352D4043259D9888C3D9457DC
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
0x7989CABFC263E2C7D7C221D480497A23
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
0xB275FB159A35A306B7EF28C313F1D3FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
0x6479D82CB6D4550ED0D428606FB24239
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
0x48A4F38C85AD08286E1FADA86F4888E8
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
0xCCC767F028563CFBBA8E5AE61E4E6754
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
0x0BB5296E0C583FA1A97A0A50DA4A4BB6
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
0xC5A794C79B467361E9F025309A1B6500
first day at Lowood.

but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
0xA121FF9BFA411821D1B055E43D7D41CE
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
0x62005B0B67B8C62C9DB041B9CDE57A3E
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
0xA230384DD46E9C1AFE6E9A8A3C994470
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
0x56BEB7AD4E784CE0D02C9D8B709AA5BF
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
0xFCC660827770EDAB4CE17BF539792089

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
0x0A6393C8903833B05ADB32602D105220
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
0x2A05C9D010B2C40BBC84881C8689150D
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
0x507AEB2079A30C4D07C06EEEA37C27D1
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
0x7CCBF5DE20928F3E4EB30DF1747E7AF7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
0x3825C4B3DA40BDB35A9B45DE231E9AAF
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
0xD2F109C2ED62204EC5F02B7B89A6AD6B
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
0x8751C92888C99408EFD82603172B96EA
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
0x320F026B6E90FF6DC52BD6DEF40310A2
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
0x6C861F324F72544240C5C4E5481E1F6D
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
0x7F13881C13A02D91C130FF8FFF24579F
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
0x80246CDD528E69B6F5A677167E1DB534
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
0x9E9DC15038371509FB19DE8ED1A98759
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
0x55F8409BC57B89546E76E3B20E7C843F
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
0x7FB0DF12FD80CEC2811FE6A9C40D185F
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
0xCAD1ADC75D2931CE1578C93DC441A8BC
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
0x59532DADD68F0FCAF70B2D08A0E795DD
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
0xEBAC05868D66532BAFFECA0C48A809D8
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
0x2844B080BEA3BCECD3A12BEF208CC7C3
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
0xE49BF2161257EDA2774EC0D041439C69
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
0x2C688FABC5D31DFEE6E8DA423431BEF2
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
0x42FAE9AE731B83BA70D62F26EB4464DF
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
0xD24E2B212540EF16B4A6C08DB46613B7
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
0x08FD3B8E74845F8722F1112FF7A1801F
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
0x19A92A07115B181FB5403A8C0DD4B165

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
0xC525E96B960E9547C9C85C87F5D286B3
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
0xB04E279CA7FD3F99884FFEB4A891249D
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
0x9D7457A91A8072FBC5C7DF9BC932315D
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
0x224CA2F5BAF9614331A85206FAB25506
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
0x2400CA3D2AF1FBCEF005E0DCA165E6EE
&c. &c.
0x43AD36A243AD36A23307480D3F445FB3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
0x6AE5FFE3F3EB0A025ADEBB065CD936F6
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
0xE93B16E346E345FE82481D5E6B9D4DFE
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
0xB6799D99868C6C7C0A28C872CC370A59
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
0xDB2E680EF8591946FEE49065EFE5BD47
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
0xE723A73E0A56A3F3128FE3E0FBB674D0
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
0xD92A64D995D4BC2740D4F8B0F9F06B34
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
0x9C53199F0B7E0C3B74F29EF10E5AF208
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
0x9CE399FCB5A1CA7D3679755DCB1B8751

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
0xC89AD6658CA601D076F966BE5BD1C522
morning!"
0xEC5749287581BAE7827A4F6F9A400651

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
0x0ED4AF6998C2958D89D2CAB0778D2986
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
0x305DE5AAFDBD61A22BBC1385499C47BC
as the water was frozen?"
0xF072825DD143943B0CDD959E4AD6F64F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
0x8D65B65F74906081B3662DA02CF6D1B2
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
0x9553B73DBCCF5AB191F5064FD6B824B3
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
0xC309A69738B7D984A1A0330208F2C7D4
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
0xF66F16F51A5B07BB5B10ECA6B65558AF
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
0x599FDBA95033330C12DB67B7F107F27D
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
0xFBD0DB29CD6A3A295A8C3E7064FB40FE
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
0x3C2BD6223FA760681F411BA1D2BE2B9D
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
0xFB921D5FA75F52B71106BBA5E5160ADE
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
0x5089C51399DB61FA29506455A8C3BB98
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
0x75926F01C52930A3DD18D7C0A4647A32
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
0x26B3945854FC3EEB94D6D648AF8B1F33
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
0xE575778F5AB4E49FAEF6920C36352C10
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
0x16DD5777E8488D5FE84C95C6D4C888D7
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
0x2CFD0C44AB12F3D95A9378B61898E72A
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
0xA3F697B2785AACD607AC0F2F0F2CD651
altered its ordinary expression.
0xAEE7CFD83B53ACB45D99EE31FEF99252

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
0x418FC0A4807CC7CF22D929C3A2748FCE
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
0x518F0157926AC1451F8147AB0187AA07

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
0x3FCBCC96A4B66F084333EED7FFA6DF9D
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
0xBF126D9F2126B4F48932834B3B3A5549
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
0x5755E79AFCE74C76FAE06A62D4623E00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
0xBD578611C8CDDA296917C595B21DFCAD
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
0xDC422F35BCA6F3BDB1C6E02C9830CD62
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
0x4FB90CAD0D1C5911F37430A8356688B1
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
0xF8A46A47DFEAFE225A852979ED9BD8ED
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
0xA79C28E1C161606DD90C0FB5C6A95042
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
0x5F2E47F636FAAE95C08DA6CC30F7C743
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
0x0E0FBCEF959E7A93CE673500162AC225
one a welcome sense of liberty.
0xE3F316BF26C64926D1F09D08C9ACF4C8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
0x243362EA273895528DFE8939444BFEE2
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
0x08E95BFEE05F488E737790D1A73CE872
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
0xACA0107864B9048692FDBC2E8ACC73B6
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
0x038BADBE9DEB1D1AE79526C6A8C7C1FA
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
0x9CAA3E3372016543E0B98EAF01BC30F3
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
0x020849F6EF9051A32B5FFAB3B231A058
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
0x4CB4C77C073E07DB7DDC848A44A7F2D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
0x90EB6320F465B1849B2188D1FE79DE9A
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
0xD457B99957CEE161A3FDACDCBC9FA71C
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
0xA679D9711DC8DE464B20586C2F24DFC0
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
0x2241281E13CAA9137615883B82A8CF7F
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
0x01407D1F085D839B115207A8285A4C8F
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
0x57602E5BBE188C6ED42ECA598DC5BFD7
to clamour.
0xF8F7F07090B10A1F9A7A1266C2C70837

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
0x9CE6704240A338FC33365F9AC1DB6EF2
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
0x26BEB7344E490ED5315935CA5EB7E279
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
0xFCA9DE0221591A3A4EB974C95F53DECD
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
0xCB849EBEAD348B528D9DD752B07C6E9F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
0xDF3311AD69F6E4E01FC4FF1B509FBEB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
0xBBC243743614E67273DA8E10228A7C48

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
0xAE1886AE2DA74B4DB59B3EE79AACA4BA
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
0x13F36AA42410619337A92BB14F9A4A5F
floor.
0xB318A95BB318A95BC33CB682B880C224

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is your name besides Burns?"
0xF3C7FAF4E8A926E738EB2784925D4E87

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Helen."
0x2034F783E340A57911D22745FDE04573

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you come a long way from here?"
0x920167E4DEBDD2ED60F4D9CBE9AE9976

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
0xC692630BD9C735E5D8190579354D123F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you ever go back?"
0xB259E768F299B5439F341D364C0B7910

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
0x89D51C89007B727B7CCB519068995138

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
0xB5D697FDDBC0E87302345976ED81CB99

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
0xACF51C08A79CDD47D69F2261D863A561
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
0x56F3C8AD5C3438A76B1E05911F819437

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
0x4349FA41CD29910C13DB6622BFF67C8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
0x749CFAEBA6007DA5AC7B54547FD9FCBD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
0x01125183063C05A2FD18290401C67BEB
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
0x92E7E0342E919FA3DA75A2DB1884FFF9
break it under her nose."
0xEBF3FC4978FE0127C85D6EFF38968972

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
0x2FD9DB2B805F1335272190BA7EA14962
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
0x5DB7E5B81D3025E7096D1D99EFEB4A44
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
0x6789363036F3B3A432D36C4CA53F3410
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
0x6A399AC67BB4B7E094426EA63FE6DDA7
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
0x2359F04E91E0ADC271EA8E13BC914349
Bible bids us return good for evil."
0x24FE211C86E32370524485BC03F9FB3A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
0x2D9F9EA1246BC21769A04121E0E5CA10
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
0xC9E7ACC0F1C804DC253450061BE34E64
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
0xE953C02BCBB2AC35654E699C4E02E0EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
0x2D965D6E8EB18920803D3956222D66F1
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
0x2F3F233F93377958DE8585646D0B9300
required to bear."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
0xFD0C476B0EDD817F48BBAD40A0D80084
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
0x4DAAAED6319C6D76C03A3385B6878C86
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
0x88A866F57574CD35FE7051A95571D595
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
0xA12D1A71E0B58520FABB3D8787CB1DA7
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
0x91578153C9C57BA26C61EBA2A72A3E7F
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
0xB3C25AC05D5482AFBB747FFF5A4A9225

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very

good."

"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
0xBB9C2239EF755080FFACC5C3D59A1113
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
0xCE740EC7E5C9A4192588D04F3144ED4B
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
0xF3A6D239B686BAA60D0F30FCAD7D5D54
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
0x70D278C95622897DE10A2679F6F7C9B5
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
0xB4FC5A2811AFB055022D1D43FADD0DE1
grave face.

"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
0x82A8F237BB2C415BBB1126750F541455
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
0xCF17306F072878BFE48EB2FF2551FDC4
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
0x3064A557F9280AC9DDAC47E3620A03EB
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
0x8236CD1280A8A85C326CA1BCE544BB08
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
0x1F740455DC4C3CDBB49501F29B87DA5F
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
0x0CB025C89861FAF05FF9746392F41FF9

0x9BC2EEBA44F8CE25EEFD0C1B3FE0AB5B
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
0x8B737BA7E7541D9133E413D599D39B6C
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,

and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
0x28D99986B1F048D92A27D2297F3490CB
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
0x0403F7B3355764A27C4D14F980A53B15
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
0xA3765B9E962A482799720D19A4F48CB2
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
0x917F9E898DCA5FC0E128618432E15ABF
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
0x4E4A01ABDEBFB0CB26D0044F45EB7A9A
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no

"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
0xBC65CF28C0D3B1793F77939D9E899000
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
0xCCDBF82A0B87A9D9751230E0BED5EF5B
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
0x9CF3376A1D635904FB5A891E073E1993
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
0x591A767056D30F68233821A1D0A8B10F
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
0xA5C83E6356126753A28B85B87BD694A9
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
0x62E781A162DA45B82C15E2FBEF87E558
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
0xA77CCE31C78AD040DE746FA2FBB82F1C
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
0x55F02AA582DBAFF8BA960B13219699F0
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right

to shed.  How dared they kill him!"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
0x38F9B5BC6B2D5C85F3D32EDBFD12A585
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
0x2F6EF05DE6273A83CD417FC051647E71
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
0x244F66D5EBE48650C460541C661D5DFB
I wished to gain."

me.  There is no merit in such goodness."

"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
0x1CDA57F1E0628C6B793E00CC7951F9C6
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
0x25EC499AF28762AD5EA76205ED26D847
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
0x74AFF15106880B788056A3BE2E16839D
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
0xA09BA432BC837F45070ABFA93ACB78A2
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
0x479EF9E3D6E5D9C015340B05ED4166B3
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the

please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
0x1D4934917074118D72DC0A8F093D02A9
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me

woman?"

cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
0x081F2DA93A4856040760456143C1651E
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
0x9F586DF608543859FFC5887AD1B9A5EB
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
0x4B92D7ABB43E1A6F217F8D579E72E123
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
0xF615715E8555F59A305A5623D7B93555
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
0xA82CA3FC51F5FBE2BEEC22236E395ECF
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
0x17CC2CB5A839C48D627C6E39F086719B
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
0xB0D7A3E8F4B950C2745AEC3D153140FC
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
0x1E4462A8999D2228FB6948A20D515BBF
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
0x2B8FC37504C9A8C2ED38176FAFC3E2FB
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
0x95A952C194FB076CD360C9A5C8F2CBAF
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
0x49FBFEB7F25FE6F820CB1C3D3639C0E8
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
0x7251F3656134023EADFD5BCEE7E7483D
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
0x0ED65A963F52DE07B042CBAFEB346466
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
0x9662EB09E16FCF2B3D36C738AFA83D9E
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
0xB85FA2D68C19B253B4B042088A6D72CE
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
0xCD91703F272A6141BE916C0A4BB4D022
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
0x5216FD2ECA83F118F105EA817CB219B3
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
0x2C9CB03EDB17D1C0613C4B5C6E080743
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
0x3BD555512087D7687418AF8B71F52C1D
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
0xBEA1631BA901259A734BD9A0BE7D2D1F
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
0x93B65C49BD2630EACA24BB51C3D7577F
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
0xB50F5586EB182DA9C3EA06F468D68969
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
0x83F39CF2CA39FE8A514EF7B2043ADBAC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
0xC03824DF64A974B6FC95ADA43ADBF2CD
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
0xD1587F02274760B1F6678A560E7D97D0
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
0xA2E98459DECDB1796DE9F947E949FD57
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
0x5CAEEAF7B485D09BE61F44B739B5171B
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
0xAD2FE7A54273710E9C7963F80163B06A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
0x215D1B55F071DF033A2FD9A316D8217A
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
0xECA8A6ED237648E79577DEFA400E8A93
without reply as without delay.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
0x69B11AD596A65CC65BE6678307DC17CE
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
0x3349D1E0591F4CA7B438ADFFBA02AA82
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
0x765BE02769F4BBA88A1A720AFD1BA188
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
0xB7AEDEB588DBF31238D79341D489B893
were no trifles.
0xE1407451968937859CBA7AA78296BE32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
0xB1C004EB530A085F96DC2E13EBC9B9D8
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
0x7C3E3F00B7F4964D3B3D0F7AE96E16FF
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
0xC74F211DD0909DCB9A7FF1ECC7712DF6
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
0x56416F3016546EEEDA6187880A0F4412
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
0xE42AC9298D8D13066387C257B76DD1D0
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
0x18B4313183FD17EE0FA6B786A1B83070
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
0x6AE143D9FD5C3171926EC50B71AD8A5C
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
0xEB31060A52A3C61EE259A6373CA300C8
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
0x78F20E5421D26BAB1C41044F41976A04
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
0x3D8BB3E28B3004D96D02D44FE6030C06
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
0x25B2EB35D1E8AFE1C014208F2AE5F06E
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
0x213D9BDFEC959DEB9219FEF5FC742C78
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
0x829A444774259EBD413774311C482339
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
0x862F55C3CB592A50C02FF41F33378303
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
0x50B2FEC19855641B43E38B210FDE0293
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
0x8A40835B5619AA37365C7AC228D0F3F9
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
0x0ABA2F9B9993B9911553AB1D3F7EB440
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
0x002938389FD3AD20BF66A1F805417CF2
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
0xEF15A6F85A4F7A8ED3126E9D909795DE
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
0x5C775D346F34AEA39496FBFCA756F2EC
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
0x0D3E40A48C53C64DC7AA82D1AAFF6620
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
0x41F85C2FA62CF259690FCA54B12F6603
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
0x3B8CE7805BA0101290FA92257DDE9ED0
meals, was served round between the services.
0xB43727DEA265998E9365FD3C0008AB96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
0x1E6670B051E8D4170A05963A48AC9954
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
0x16AA348362DAD9830BEC14B433C72B6C
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
0x521DA16AF1689B9D11EACE4CE63929F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
0xE4EE907AA9E22D743DC85511EC0EE88C
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
0x539409B1DDA3336C5516D5B55C29E879
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
0xE234338AC72156F2127B000D1660A4B1
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
0xFEFE029BE270295366724F5B20CEEE13
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
0x053C25F3BCBBF1835C7A0CAAA9474708
to attempt the task of cheering others.
0x91BEE985F83E315DB1949F77C9CAAE5F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
0xF52E71D4B8AE4474201EBDEE5EBFD319
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
0x269AD54EEAD635E08D9922075CECAF02
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
0xCD938D0CEE6EC0805011FC7E059800D2
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
0xB93BAE4B9CC947B94EEA926A6BC0D5D3
starved arms in their pinafores.
0x6E08B654C683E20F60044194F81ACE2F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
0x61ED9F869B1FF9AD1ED239BE058999B1
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
0x867D2E9F131807BEE96C09BDB9C7C563
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
0xC327EE5A596E6AB52259FBACA0D3000F
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
0x7943E81B91BF978AE1F70886D844B4CB
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
0x53359FAAD984815210AF1348F047F1F0
invariably obliged to part with.
0x9229FEA61657AC6A27526C1E0D7793EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
0x3E13FECFCA37D75327ACC4B0C0F11052
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
0x6EBB60369596E28BDD1FC36665F598E0
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
0xA516D8F8FAA758F6C3BF3C24BB41EA67
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
0x0473FC07E296DEC8866D601A961C3DBE
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
0x96CB0711D006C71205DAA996A7824E5B
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
0x5B4862F3EE0440E92A545CBD01F82908
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
0x5E6CFED77E02C80559B7E7A894C8F233
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
0x2389DFE8D32E592020F9CB220626B105
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
0x3A5EE1AB8FD408264FB719442053B20C
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
0x2974AEDDBFCAB6BB2C7D2418E08282AB
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
0x2A3BB44F312106169AEA3DAC68408C3E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
0x6A1394CEBC52D04239113158E150E7E2
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
0x8DAFE1FADC811439D835C6BA41BA51CD
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
0x06C2F016229E187172E04B3161A19ACD
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
0x566880877FCB003060C2C32F6D107DB0
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
0xE9A725C610CD0996382596510FEA88F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
0xCF8A3CD10BC05B4EF500FA4DC3BB0BED
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
0x8ACD15A3B3F8FD4F4FCD09F0E3ED43A0
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
0xC350BC0CBAAE83E5466351F7D646D556
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
0x4EA94CF7C8E221E11D978FA92BE75A06
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
0x19396632A251FD9DA82110989DA82F9D
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
0xF4DE1E13FEE609558E071D44574E041D
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
0xD859E137926606095F80E9D76444F097
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
0x7D7AD4E7C8E26364FDE021FEBF779845
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
0x7197EE1C8128D1D301A9BE551D15AA32
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
0x5A90B32B841E617B5133F729DEF9EA54
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
0x8DD9D358693C766648B41AF381AEFD38
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
0x1D5B972B92429339C4160AA01E703C4E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
0xFADBC3E798D248531BBADB67ED63D870
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
0xA522B491A4368C0837494F405B929B0E
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
0x25E773F780D28662569214D73386AD3F
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
0xE427A16F0F73E4D61FBAB5EFDC3E9FD9
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
0x30E55416558E9501DE81CC3FE44C47FA
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
0x1280A2F72EA3D60AA9D22C26A43C30BA
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
0x85B7EE94F82DAFBFC4830D39280433E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
0x2EFA7EF7E40C91189D605F853076F86F
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
0x881ACDDE1369454613F3537D0C3B5BD0
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
0x393AA78C05A29DAFEA5533027DEA9025
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
0xA86FC5DFC3604AC7969B1F062E1274DC
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
0x538215045B216FB12FF02C326890928A
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
0x8F05CE985262D38931150BB510D2B136

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
0x583BE1164445CA87F5596350C1FB94D3
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
0x59E8309EB0B3A67359233D0CCE1FFACF
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
0xB46A1732C53E9716B31C7AD1821A6A38
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
0x36317D870D0E5C8A05B9C3024A643056
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
0xBBE0103F64B500F3A4437EAAEE296990
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
0xC9B894A3AA0AB3F462ECC36B23721242
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
0x8D7357308A90BA9FF88BED6B83140154
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
0x2D3E73075E7DE320A43FB5058FA8228F
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
0x7FDF7B0538EA3D0569BA8E74D388420F
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
0x3BF8BB68B08230D1968AA1F0BC589460
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
0xCCB264BCE5EECAEA1FBBE846AC1937EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He paused.
0xF1DF89AF719174D677D5E62EA2DE01AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
0xE27808A1A4857E0CB8741B0783DE4DE9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
0xA332610D24945C119261623714926B25
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
0xA453F078481E3DC8F31CAE98B2729935
to one."
0xAA6152C05284CA71CC42C13E073E24D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
0x5F27AB0BFCC23C2939AC67B15E9124E9
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
0xD419E6CB97F89DA5C41BD923D4EDBACB
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
0x00E1AE1A2B5D2C7DDAEE18373E5A78B3
occasion."
0x022741C17446D5FB82F91F9E53F57ED7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
0xDDAC788DFF0B7DBE1EC63F91A2E3B2A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
0xE79F4C3F5617D252AAF3C67945FBE3AF
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
0x2C5B259D96531DA21A13B02A98D079A2
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
0x30CC695F3647618904B18255C83C743F
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
0x7941E2CF91DE820AD4EF772AE01A7178
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
0xA5FDDC552D4602F433799A6E6FCB34B9
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
0xBCAD08B7F74DDB817686D7832DFE631C
what authority?"
0x4E7E5238CDB41E5E370E2E75C23F1506

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
0xF30E3295D47D49A695151CB8382EEF66
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
0x89BB735C9CC8A6AFB9F1B30E52FE18FE
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
0xB21FF0D534B653FE418E26748D9F1376

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
0xBD9878AFBFD1931AB69022119DCA723E
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
0x6C3145BE0758CEDFCB1E232BDC4E351F
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
0x5060019C53CEDB47A96BD63187814322
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
0x59F51270F0E442CA927AB939D83523E1
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
0x8919300AE7C47BF0D60F8EA0A8F86F5E
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
0x734A1D0D2710ECAD7B5DE5F1143877CD
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
0x8323A843DA65449ACF2C54D7B1EB3553
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
0x6AF774456E2F556731D119A8329B62D7
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
0xF8E3D48FF9E3D55A2397E375409AB7F2
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
0xD7E25EB89F5CED23A781001269347255
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
0x66726583F5EFE190321833BF60BAA93A
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
0xB976A90531A9A4356B4D60058C854FFB
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
0x51B54CA98FE89EBC79192F44B2F7EB90
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
0x0E0A35F4B3057CD360EE5F244ECC8A43
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
0xD658355D3A67AC8AA59C296799C58F04
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
0x5381CEF7A24CA8F50E31637E45D18CDF
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
0x5EC6C4BA4A8963147BFACF053EF2AA90
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
0x2336986A8A4185A095123462B3D73944
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
0x5082E6BF23A4CEA2D53E467C449B1012

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
0x65C6BFABC4BCDE9C9C71A14CEBCB0C66
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
0xCE15B9A874166BD80083F2CF3FDAAC48
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
0x852DC32466D6DA5CA061E9CD6156A40B
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
0xB98B4A6016D3167AFBEBB7A3C2B977F5
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
0xA9F81983D05B206AD195F145FB40F7C4
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
0xE9E15E2BFC40BF44F54EDA922720C847
severity.
0x0D6F7C131C595B550148CECD19421BD0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
0xEE1F69F0EF454BEF09CBC34BDE9355B8
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
0xE451D7A0E132EF31B9712F4C39513F2D
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
0x5A7C59713302D3D882CB4827B5782F2D
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
0xE51522BF2C5CCB211CD221C821694D33

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
0x828F6E44D7D4D6D3E2616A68B7A558A2
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
0x792D13D6E743E0F1D03F9638EFF0888C
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
0x3C2580743A0E2A3E7E7BCEFBDDF14C61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
0x0F08E6FB6439E3195E78BF8713DA15D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
0x64EEA9AB6F74A7878C493C6C2A3C5899
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
0x4D6A8DF69A0502FA845F3AB316FF53B1
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
0xED8CB00BC11F45033B37B37447FCCDB7
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
0x273BF3EB870248A17AE76B8D0002FF67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
0x99E0734BE6DB18B29DDF7806A6E2E945

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
0x35E3D63541C12A438E3434CC9C803B01
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
0xA9F9011A2C52C7C4D2560019E9F111C9
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
0xE246C365F67F6146425BC09325AF62E1
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
0x0AA9AF6DFA9C142378E95952A6E26945
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
0xDDD9418A4CF8AF690CCE4A802015E0C5
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
0xA58FEC8D5CC3129B60910ECD3842A75A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
0xF9D290497F76C0F6D578556BA4D011BC
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
0x93F69B8E2DA16C558E50A2C9C893403D
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
0x1163847056841B59B8F261BC3A07C073
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
0x11901736546A1A4562975617B5CC7632
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
0x159A57994F774BB62B89C43EF2A92810
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
0xDF407099A762BEEAD38C399179CB3DBF
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
0x32053E40148C79FB52163DABBE31C7B8
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
0x452A04E620AF1F7889CAB6E695AB96CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
0x377A0DF9D0B3DA215448F9478F4772A9
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
0x644BB65535A1B9E92D40E116E70CF2BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
0x5E0C8E0576F1BF91D1543BC5D9AB97FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
0xA37FBCE35BF837C5683CD2AB5E8660E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
0xFEAC1CE5EE6D5651174529D1356DDC2C
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
0x774F059C1A668DAB3D6C4F76997F678B
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
0x107DED3C1EF8B7EF44EFBFCC84509D23
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
0xC952B3A13789AE775A035C2D8189517C
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
0xFBE48FD3E730B0EFC13601ECB506F0F1
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
0xAB1541E8D43B74081E30AAD56A4A843B
time wasted, of--"
0x4F49AA98C2F634632E0A8D971C70CE02

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
0x4F39358142EE1DED5B0451A3EAE3139F
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
0x026CE53A584E08C65CD9E5C639D2CF4D
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
0x0B0FFBC064DEE1E4E696C02ACABDD2D2
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
0xB42EB5B11B41DCA55F432F7B8B77C86D
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
0x458FA80ACE98C017CF73D361E7465016
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
0xDD31775F54C183FD885382A2990DFEF2
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
0x32FE69FDA84340F4400D9835D9A49680
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
0x93275AB7339337EF1A4652591B0A96A1
false front of French curls.
0x65824C66CF694480FD1802F912E4CF06

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
0x2F501B30136D5AF4D31979B15920B430
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
0x98826B185CF0A67B0CC4006308762EDC
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
0xD68987BDDE9EC1FB2CF31EF02BAEBA8F
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
0x4CB6567F56B3E04971713EAFB59C139D
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
0x8D61DF7CB874481272DD9FE03EE91F66
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
0xE47331E735C0712EEBBB33E8C2572040
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
0x27E508E8AA1B0C81ED87C14E8609F20F
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
0x8E0D8CA15358A0A2F13E29FA997CBAA5
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
0x0F84F31E824F0931AE8EAD58D4F83CE4
my attention.
0x05F1F2388DBCFFCD7B4BE42472A361ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
0x661011668E34CEA776C199516C77911D
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
0xBCDA692D4EB68E9E78D8F4C6227DFD59
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
0xE229E4B1B12A41DA6931D31B7179FFD0
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
0xD092C5083C79F482809D9B152B868778
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
0x33522A6BBBDFF6CD6FAFA0CEFC5556AE
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
0x92E7FEA9980F356DC41782FDAAF5A403
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
0xBD7A865B8757A5587B6E00B451A1C37E
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
0x4D01AA01BF69C140428257B35EB7AA89
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
0x80760043A457738AC13EAFA812FEAAF7
my forces for the worst.  It came.
0xEBAE91C485F2E9B933E535CE6BF406FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
0x581E24B76A4E5A080F096998CFC601C1
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
0x9FE56180A11DAAC55D13E57771F098FD
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
0x3B040404F0A1E6F1645C4C6039C7887A
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
0xCC1B8FBDD0BCDD15B3C013864476C9B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
0xB8061E371FC3F7643DE9F8106874BABB
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
0xA5F0B5114F154A514153E47D79445E86
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
0x37DA9830CE74976AB164E19D1F95A08B
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
0x19884A5C34221E7E197E0F4555587EDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
0xCBA77A3749264A6FB7401E51CDCE66F9
punished."
0xE9979B25082B0AF8600DF153568EA7DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
0xF8DFC6500B9BD34E71CBDF17759ECA78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
0x9BF196CC292CD810D2EA7F846E7C8179
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
0x1BAFDFB34ABA18E5102B956353DC3CEC
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
0x6D4A36AAEA32BCC4A30F9E58F91A7DCB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
0x154257D036EA5DB07B8DEFD2B97E08AD
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
0x2EDA5D93D80E7F12A7D247920949F235

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Place the child upon it."
0xE86B92D137703331DDFA78EDCFC93E0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
0x2C10A8FAD93B80EF022F05642DE246A4
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
0x6269C00CF7B4C56FA7007C4B687CB645
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
0xEA2D1570FDE74FF395E6DECB77FA8B6B
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
0x28ED7B4E2F990537CCE013EDFD97515F
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
0x82D0CB059B4502C16D7E49FFC84159D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
0xDE39B9129BD34953F4F60593A7339AED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
0xE29B17DEB8BF3A29463DCA8BA11BDB07
children, you all see this girl?"
0xD4AADD94D23C1793A3F008659302D8EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
0x2584D50B910D6DBF014466B3401E509E
against my scorched skin.
0x5E685790423AE85CC2A5386444B81A6B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
0xD82E88558DF551BA8133F52B7AE4DC62
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
0x3A3968D8879FA1603244C13C211AE27D
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
0x1F1F433405E418476C7E2353B5DF21D5
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
0xD9425D5C9CC21E4D43F1B989A5F5BD25
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
0xD46EA90D0E5BFC05821B2226E3BE5F1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
0xB14C3AFFF20B3CAAA31AA6F2F11D4A03
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
0xC71025C0A72F6A5CA85C9220E8156193
must be firmly sustained.
0x4BDDD66320A663D8D0A04F5F723A4C9D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
0xD721CE6961D8A5253F16235F12323D55
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
0xE02347BA28D2081FF57C200882EF5485
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
0x17851F99066AAAD366BAF0101C5EBADB
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
0x56A2DD3481DA1790A0F98C1307F484D0
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
0x57CE81A94054EDCC2157014F4D81CFBC
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
0xFE5538E2F8F904D66289A2D5B29DA947
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
0x49D26F0B22DA285D51B26F1E1763BFAA
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
0xFEA7280EB7C79838E186406C86F16CB5
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
0x3FACC3CF0E6ABC166C9791EC25929452
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
0x37309C39DF3DB5CD86402A8C3A3B4DAE
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
0x38838C16A5AD19D71552BA691333362C
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
0x61582F0963C1CED86FF3E1D5FEE38A3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
0xAE678B0019ABFF17CE26FAD40770EA42
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
0x49ECCCF2AE30C335B676AC9A941E08CC
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
0xB2C65858C697BC5A867318F1BB293D3D
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
0xE761D70A4780797B344070EEB464DECD
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
0xC5A25B25ECB144478EB598958BEF89EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
0x6B760106CBE036C0557054B3A0FF17A7
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
0x8977D3ED5C22AB3287F0759FCDDA1BBF
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
0x9A2A96735BCC951B99E7777736F3A49A
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
0xC9EBAAC1FAED991F66E0F4CA10C9165A
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
0xA010D2EDDFC7B46BE802239344C8457E
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
0x54DA4242714337C8A6FF2AF7EB0B0D5A
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
0xE65591F8AD78E5A74BD302642D5BE151
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
0x8E26354AEBAC5E75818C6B104C4034E5
waters to stagnate round her."
0xD94D27DA08A9C11FBBEF7081049B65B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
0x448736C859448AE2E2A7C1EEDEDF2AC9
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
0x726DFE4DAC843C4ACA756F8609DDD21D
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
0xA38368DF9F5A9987B48F8E82AFEE0D26
Turning at the door, my judge said--
0x5BAF47FE73F173C6ECD77E169FC7AB34

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
0x6ABA35332C07394E1F362B5DB8ACA475
her during the remainder of the day."
0x64DF904559A8789B62C2D8CA7D5FA86C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
0x3DB707BD7A64456E5BCDF7CAF6734620
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
0x4A245344196E4C9EDC8AA2675A651B76
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
0x8E157FA25A89E395C9E808E449F97B6F
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
0x98E83B53CFFA1FAF2DE7864B12AD80D4
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
0xF5A3BAF6708311CFC839417D4A5E6C79
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
0x83232EC44EA5EE3A1EB662E8BB8865DD
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
0xADCB52EC6DD972561F4501A0E887A8F4
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
0xC1F24B97D15318E92A7F032D0DB4448B
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
0x18E51673F69A6D72CABCC46CD7AD106D
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
0x2E47428521FD0D81C8994322BB692338
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
0x8C0C0F2297302A4BBD7A311AB8A90F54
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
0x442B4D9084C5C6CF0D7112FE98789E37
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
0xDEFF7146BD1483DD58BB67C1EA1C0930
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
0xB0987435BE71F276220FEEF6506537AA
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
0x2DFA27246DB038DD026A2A42FDE23A6C
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
0x9A442F5685C5F7B3F221ACD00C914797
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
0x3C6047D8B85010C394F8FBFCFC93673E
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
0x664AF97DCE5204FFB0C84D6FEF0C4D32
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
0x7269030470F6BC877EBC8DA497A69BDD
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
0xB51F0464B315B4F98F809202DDFE9193
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
0x51246372C3A02F14B8C05EA6215FCD97
the full brightness of the orb.

Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
0xB874BCC031057D6A5E791A0880B015CF
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
0xB428EC68C7566DFAEF9837678CC9EB1B
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
0x16830AE02CC3123CF5853E1468AC168B
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
0xB21F7FB79574C711DA13F8FF32AD7CF5
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
0x5E97C2C0FF370A2D7F93F41477C9016A
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
0x25D232647FCDDA631128F314D5D64B4C
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
0x28D40AAC4D05D5F07CFFBF64816993F0
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
0x37BC55AF20CEA9D5B8A9FE8F45B90652
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
0x7931837D0B4A04A28047F82B709BAE0E
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
0x87AD0B25F082A373B4DB4706ABC2FEB9
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
0xB152FE6C5AAC2835E183D96E0AE2DD9C
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
0x763FBFAB9CDC531FAD684A1411891D12
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
0x0405468DC05725DA7C231A95FB78CC6E
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
0x65E965D52AE1AAA5A45956F45C72051A
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
0x64D8A21CAECA7EAD570CC4E5DD8D6882
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
0x57DE7E0EEF416392A8CF6FDF726E55AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
0xB666684C8BD16A24A21894AE46B149E1
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
0xF83A19375E8F4107EA53A5F0946A1763
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
0xB9545F127ADEEA9B5B2768DF867ED501
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
0x405DE0AC100D9EC2C7A65383023FB990

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
0x96CA1C5FE5EFC782D1B2FB074105A8B0
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
0x7A4E29A6F1CB1D15B15365B10E32B45B
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
0x3BEA4BE230204686AD946C7F7C5053C2
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
0x9123C833E8D1B51D7543222565658ED0
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
0xB92CE0E6FDB79353712BE92C90201648
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
0x429C7582C0450334EA069BFE4705BCD3
first who spoke--
0x76135AF72987F0E7C00982B941A178B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
0x314A5801996FDBABF38786689F07851C
liar?"
0x1DBE53711DBE5371B4AA2B72415EAB5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
0x5ED16A2DEEF19AD06AD26BB7E5B4C0F5
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
0xADBDBBBAC52EF2CFFF8B6A6D5323D332

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
0x65A8A7653436EF9CFB628DD99CC69041

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
0x810CD180D2C0E312154CC9953CE2B385
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
0xFFEC08C4879185D09AADE17F418EAD26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
0xDFFA9CB62FDBD3D87EB02CADFB005DA5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
0x79B565420EDFB616E35E4304E5D0D409
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
0xC0A9A8B3124D7AE9D1715C612651853B
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
0xD58EC313EAA8EA90CA8B3820DF96A716
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
0x95522FB1055E9F75BB05E187859DD59D
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
0x48F863851AA411F7F972B566EADA4C41
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
0x159F2BD7E76EE491499F5D38E1D5D566
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
0x5D6AB40C2AE78E0DC319654C403177DD
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
0x5649ED6442C574C90F1F373B62346573
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
0x32EE7784434E0E136F7ADCB8870FB641

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
0x7C3FE29CA15CB873DB382819EC6FE3F2
gently to warm them, and went on--
0xB71406D8DBDE5616D193D16E4387E5EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
0x7B2645860104A71E027F4D2A182E1363
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
0x76A9149059381161A9551CC9E362CEC3
without friends."
0x52D623EBF20C4453219C54A29BDDFED3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
0xAEE74E6B485E2A0C1F6310F1C3E92A92
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
0xD83C03441E468FF28D0C1911C4521A44
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
0xCCEEF7A1FF621EF047C2746754E648BE
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
0x343862D090EB74528A192EA232D42A18
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
0x5FB59DCF107F7F103791BF42E6201FED
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
0xB73A412C9F63641BF1DB00333C5A6970

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
0x8DA1A5F807BDD9F80D597FA9A5A7223E
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
0x46474F8630694391DD869C96A268BCD9
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
0x3E2B4D527B3C50BFF79AB264CBC2D04B
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
0x3CB7114C73903E81024A28B210B96C2A
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
0x58E03AB1D8B0C23F26D610E535CE7254
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
0x43EDAAA5D40774B94ED3F6E1A87F9CB8
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
0xFAC4ED72B1BFE7E1F9FBA52BED929F33
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
0x136E0BCB319D226615BB19A077507A5A
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
0x37CB2F0DB6ADC3BA0C1C3BE51AD010E0
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
0xAB1D5E139B4A10B5683ACE1CFE66C004
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
0x37B9F17C0560D349D7A861B958C6ADE1
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
0x3877EEF616AFBB150FDC8EA5C308F335
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
0xCCD34F6D37549D1FBD2A2E68388D4C99
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
0xB18C2496C1FACEAD92372B41A55CB305
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
0x8CC9510208DFC8F1F67D5559DA4845C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
0x5C4ACE8CE6E422C0C5618FFEB4468701
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
0xE49F7461203F5B0D74C206EB3432AED4
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
0xB9B7D637921C27C260C110AC37A9B47E
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
0xC16C6870B12511009FAD6367762821CD
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
0xF0CF76944C4738EA6DB77FEC8B4097E3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
0x5131E157EF9C18FD8A38A28844E899A0
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
0x9BED6CEF0AD651C5ED259CFC7C7F78F9
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
0x8AA5A16EEAC77207903DD8D9CD08BDD5
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
0xDDFF2D963330A35D572061708221D42A
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
0x80CE84488E839EEAD7D79FADE10EF092
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
0x2F186746A0E0B7634CF1814AEA7C9117

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
0x601359BF4B8F4AF21A84D3C07E6E66C6
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
0x3D486BEF9259B73452EDCBD42BD3ABEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
0x9128E7CE503F4996DF95D2DB09D5CB9E
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
0x442E5EDC5A99F51AE5820CDBED25ED09
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
0xCB8564AE918D4C9701AE0E53E9A97B25
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
0x1C1BAE9220D1E013076961512F346AE1
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
0x1EBC8FAE65964A59DAA2333F186AF279

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
0x8DECAF86624C95AA09C874BD80B49B5F
your grief away?"
0x4344CA9A9811B1B4F6CF67304006FC02

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
0x4FEC0461036CEB8DD9E8D03620A96E77

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why?"
0x945337BB945337BBAA9B489B8A1EF709

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
0x5F7F66ED765EE53FED17EA3C26423C2F
will now think me wicked."
0x77F74FED6C184C198BA5F6051C7658AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
0x79618DE37A4A6391D69A3E598967A97D
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
0xBBA4734AE2FB0B827ECDF0C74F1F328A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
0x8929EA4B4F97136B4A76E32824E362A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
0x8360DEFEDBFCA6373436EDB87A9AE57D
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
0x583F53BEC1F69DAD50D7C171B042D199

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
0x28D08A8121BB73600FA02C8C0417BE5E
care."
0xF69E34FEF69E34FEBB10EFD05D021805

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
0x36DC1461AC9F959CC56588104DB23988

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
0xDFEC3922B049A49DA8CEE72871832FC5
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
0x6457A5CF39EFAFE4AEB889BF4A6DA112
always keep me."
0x47F2D8EC87174A8A8B0353AA095EDF5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
0xEF4FC4326930560FA920165BA884992A
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
0x93C34ACCEB9BD6FB90FF0314421FC284
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
0x93F3BEBF958F85F3DD34E208441BF429
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
0x16766679E73807D8A5CD77741035281A
exaggerate nothing."
0xA55F802173B0591BAA99292B9210DEA2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
0x0057B6449D8DA13A430168D9864ECA06
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
0x420AFD678AC53855D4B514335CE7C49E
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
0x25BADB4F47797CDF6A25CEF093C4B79B
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
0x9BAAE768AFFAB8E5DE27A20900D58B3F
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
0xB647C25B35A3BFFFCC8D2B4FC99D69C3
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
0xE083BCFC556AC836477C177B7B540CB0
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
0xF7AC29996F7A61328ACEAE8257AEA3D0
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
0xC59DA983A9045FAC79B374A9948073EA
Temple fully believed me.
0x4F17CF9DB49EB3FA34E61B12CDCE1E86

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
0x10A355BA4A436E89E2D0A34C933B2CEB
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
0x4511DA1F8CCBE65863D7F0A6948E320F
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
0xE92AE4B8D49F27150E424C08790A0B7F
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
0xD364BCA8EB6ADE10DBB027552E20BD14
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
0xF919E82B52C846332180918684DB27D5
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
0xEDCDF867DAAB4F6D64B185D925A0A34A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
0x6AEFB60B16F04100FF1AE4CB6E44E3C8
then said--
0x1C7CDC4EDC5FAFF70FE17816FBB604E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
0x5C572969D6FA14312940EA0DF0BC422C
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
0x59A6F6E284C03DD419CDE80861075A66
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
0x823771F350C2FBF80FD319829014C0E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
0xDB6335A206E2A72128911702C7E66EAC
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
0xE6EA5569BE75778C952F00DF5C8FB237
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
0xC47B3D9A5729DD710F5333BA58F4D818
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
0x5A55B8B61A027B0C54C60535C85FCF35
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
0x442EFD64D786F490BEEBDA03FF17BB23

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
0x8DA30C26C251909AA381C1A6ED0FEC3D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
0x379F4FB7E88B504C826FC7741348CDFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And the pain in your chest?"
0x77226C74144B2D44802F1016ABE3B4BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a little better."
0x1D93087BC8A31E76F263F22A8BD6CDD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
0x539EBA6895AF2C312BC91C9424197BB2
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
0x21F6DDCF7B45793C8184F748A129DDB0
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
0xC882F187DC66DE03B5CBF13F8D77EB6C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
0xA0F2C4BBEAB7B2A145AEB6283F86E2AF
rang her bell.
0x4F764649E0BE84AFBACEF8F93E68385A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
0x719A5FAC4F1F811416904D1244C9C541
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
0xED896759FE3EBB0DE8EF62121500BAFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
0x18D86DD5629A3B36DD89153F7EB94D34
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
0x06E416C1C2713653DF19AF5F84B0CD6B
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
0x4F86304FE378436FE8BADB425DEBEB06
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
0x6C8BD1EE61812CECB87BFEB88B4A65C8
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
0x528E6B7D3AA620B4092FD48CD7A4CAEC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
0xF5771FE2D67A358617314E73A32B076C
There is not enough for three."
0x1698A8990B19D67461FAE8470AA3EB99

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
0xD6F86069B1A91202888D4A53FFD9DC49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
0x1ED08A7873A0BEC45EB9F71ECABA1A43

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
0x6B0241ECDC76AE0B788FED9F6710A511
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
0x3C06EEFA5220C9769993D18880E4DEE3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
0xA231EA0332CB471AD68B35C40437C27C
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
0x9341C48B1AD0C2582CFB5508797361CA
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
0x378018CD15E0CC01F596FD240EB3288E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
0x1D4708485E0A5AD7966BA2130B0DE0AA
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
0x400FE9609C5352498E033625C0091489
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
0xC2BF6A6B8F2623CA5B6F2A290D40E150
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
0x9F675D01A5ED4656717373BABD6E1A35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
0x10FD0EA0049008BECCC346C71A7CDA53
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
0x1FE9E3FA9F552B5D6F83D186A4123F71
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
0x731ECA364020C8E46F93B2334249D2F4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
0xAA83E878BC4387A6BAF0BB25D2D5F515
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
0xF6D6EE9C329C3A4E29653C597CF4E6E5
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
0xB2D0E758E8244BD50DEEA1DC1CB68FC9
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
0x1AC917D1BCF9A10601F9530000C58971

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
0xB31D92F170A1655F69BBD6060BDCE725
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
0x3D3C48B7783DB44AE1B9F02267639821
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
0xA49185C075416AA8F1B688D1D35214A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
0x9D357F86FD44ED39C0756D80FD6CF71A
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
0x8A776E5BF12C8696E94078DFE806F267
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
0x847549F492CB7CBBD45A8084FA6D72F7
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
0x64D8D30140D4A8167E000CCFEB742E81
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
0x6F380046C1CEA380B724D43910295FA2
struck with wonder.
0x700CB6CEEB4DCC01ED5E3B783DDC99A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
0x0E7795DA43068F18C2CF330CA1FE9A86
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
0x6A6D9ACE790EE98A0A168214954B9C45
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
0xA19856552CBBB522D72656C032DE7F25
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
0x0691391BA4309CB955C9CB4941CCF423
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
0x7146F8E4FA42CF9ABDBF6CCC9E08EBD2
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
0x782F8F0AA37DE7F1A2A9A363F5AC8F06
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
0x23F176A7771E8935C90974CE7BC5AD41
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
0xDF7CB640E2BE61ED31AAB3820C69CB19
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
0xBDDCF306DB921EC08E796056BB9EF626
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
0x97ECE64F5CA6AB5EF18676E8979F5314
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
0x52DFB16141EE03CADEFEDED9EA7A94CB
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
0xB83A018266DB6BEE255801E6E64F75D2
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
0x62A17210A4E592DD1FFE1958695D7EA3
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
0xABD5C5AFBA2C1570D4FF909958BFB9A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
0x0240E343F2263D092AB090C21451AF92
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
0x937D7FFA343B97527F6BDDF7B7F34717
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
0x790306A0636F0C236592B417FA7D68CA
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
0x58E75C9F20569EF39BC004E3D2D17C72
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
0x22B84DE8DB9723CCBCF8219EADB3C744
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
0xBFFF8F4978B7CA485EFEDD3A6074086A
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
0x1954B9A5FD28D72DA923D9E1E61B46AE
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
0xE0A240CC4830BBDE719D4A539CBACC68
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
0x015395A96BEFA298DF6B6C0D59661A58
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
0x61E5050D1AA9BE50F38E22F4D8EF24D9
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
0x80B3B57220BB914E7A2EB5BBE69FBD5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"God bless you, my children!"
0x2D00951A5A12433AAEA2F31039D2518F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
0xFC9132E32E0DB748DC8EC5B0A8CAD921
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
0xB8C2E68ECC041AC56E6F75D2AD3181F6
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
0xDFE65174948206C9DEFC84C792832923

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
0xC207940C3D8A04C025EFD4A57B560EDC
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
0x5D6EEBF37FBD85E6086DFAFDD759236A
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
0x2D6B7B3DD309A65C189D876C4483DB25
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
0xCF0A36703FC5B6016B9CF9434B1CBA5B
shoulder.
0x714AEDCD2952917C39A39A845B26BEAC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
0x9424E81688719260531A2ACE4376B641
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
0x62B8F86B4782F69FF443DAE2FC480665

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
0x4B348BDBF93811DCE6C10145D48441DD
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
0x6966D91A60A246FF71819C0334560306
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
0x5D55CF4195B5E7998548DA87ACAB6337
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
0xA969BB87A7D8AF3211CB8AF922624E01
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
0x9FB92026B71BE2C8014621B0D6956588
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
0xB91900C68478817B028F91EDB6D29BF7
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
0x028F231E62EA117F81FD42AB6A4E73CF
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
0xF0060B043A8001CC855EAA6D0EDF927E
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
0x51DAD8D16F05469871B5E79E471779E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
0x02AD39E45E2D12739BC87613EC2F4DA4
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
0x795AD37D5BA349D278BCBC4FFF0EF464
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
0x230C2A67D40E5A47C252E8D54AEECD93
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
0x24F9CA7A5BD321B99CB4B77AD65311C2
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
0xBFE3991E42D2A3D23E8B76EE87D7CEA5
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
0x6EEF806DE1BBA4C8A1277AD34DF89412
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
0x444EE64435B42232378A0DFB9584C556
through the ranks of my companions.
0x3BF5C3835DE6672450A4E5BA1DE2A85F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
0x33122787F1EAF28966B5D4C40E41EC53
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
0xFFA19F639BCB778EC15A5A0B4C64ADB9
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
0xDA5DBCA0D2CA825CDFFB5CF1A82D88BA
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
0x013B120CA6AF533E65D5C25D7D848F5B
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
0x79ECE7BB2420D01B26FAF83A4AE86F62
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
0xC60C9110936952264A02A57D6323CE97
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
0x6E2001504F50E8EB47AAA14FE04BD9FE
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
0xA9CF41A5345B8D8A0973874E50159812
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
0xA16A73E563F1FC19A3BD305AE6DA1699
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
0x50C97279BA2CA178C59B7D4038BF6F57
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
0xF083987A92B31F8FC93AF6536AF4D2FA
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
0xE16F98434FDB95A187EED87B50C2189B
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
0x8232022D765756A3DBD4AD8F7213E3CA
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
0x0EF5D320DF7A341AD31B54EB0235A993
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
0x049B9ABBC95778CA5B9D4114BA7380AA
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
0x3BD69A5C389345961A294AEEC5124667
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
0xFDCDC3A4539E15C1698162017500EDF7
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
0x2704E04668297F153250B9A961A1C23D
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
0xB11AF31432628F01ABF42FDAD8BFAC19
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
0x3533BEEDB67EE8703D3A1FD49AD8B80E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
0x5BE627C95CB0C0940ADC75B9C3BCDF8E
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
0x04D1347E65DFA30929A826584CFB393E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
0x7DFF8D8515D4B2C14ADFEDB818F9867F
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
0x5ECDC2E31A9FEBD88D19CEEF42BCDA16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
CHAPTER IX
0x1C849A3CA58AFDAE58FDACB3AFABB374

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
0x8F18E802DA524ADC381C6C1E8F686D9D
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
0x4F938F1955DC8A4AD34308D27BD0721B
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
0xB9641D26C9441DA266DBC6F154CE246E
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
0x5642EF63F4E8761F4D99182E93223166
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
0xA3EEB386CBA1FB9CB3D855070776BA7A
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
0x2F23E097CA556FDBDA19BA07C046341F
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
0x2F52ACB9BAE7FE622773604BA1EA0520
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
0xF0836554171C7E72E538F7C0621E6C0A
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
0x19AC2FF4C70609B5C3A2DE65561AFD53
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
0x5FAAD6048969AF9A4AECAA8CBD10932F
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
0x2D5BEF8C723AD04FBF464B9701E6FC8E
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
0xE70AAC6BAB4C0834F35DD77317B16DB6
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
0x0AF7324CCC640FBBF60FF0B35A3C3AF5
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
0x1E9D2DD8E418BB907D273430A5C9730C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
0x30A78BC9DB6414D5F9EF738BCCC473DE
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
0xC112A4620207820B827B90F24F20EE7F
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
0x0281CC55C14328CA3CE53A87A4C64AB4
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
0x9CE622047C6B43B5A5521A4C1375BA02
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
0xA6135B2269DD387E9BAC566DFD1B04DF
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
0x781AB081BF0FE34BA7F0273840904022
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
0xED9BCC0F136B7AD75169E91599ED64A1
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
0xFF491ABAD9BB9AB5C0B43AC22D9DFCC6
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
0xCA604B638C207AF6781CAFDA09BA3E42
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
0x273014099BAA3DDFB0E39E7986E0D18A
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
0x2C1A63C027F515FCEE5DFDF048431D8D
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
0x59567310F3D78397A23E80B85C7AF404
of skeletons.
0xA9BD8B24F1EAC8706196B29596B22661

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
0x78C75C5FA20508B27C9AC79DFFD3425E
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
0x13C637929577D3B413FC023505982557
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
0x1AEADED1D47D7E9EFB2C27413AB41484
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
0xADC13D7D343149DB7444E1F5C0FA600D
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
0xB54326246DA8D1E7EE9445930F0AFDB1
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
0xEDB0EDAF90DDCDC2A791586229E33D0F
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
0x03E5FE74BB600A628AD3BDF01C00DDD7
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
0xD7BB5D0E0DF403BC84A21915EC901E0B
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
0x24FC20A42F4D68CE8C7C641A999C16C7
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
0x82391ECA696EC528E34F45DD47526224
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
0x7DE8573C271A5B2EDCC3654B553D9F67
advert.
0x9525395995253959B08FF98AA0DABFF4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
0xCD1F9199EC585472877562182C0113AF
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
0x040152852A28C7A04C887643DB9BB939
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
0xD55CABE90E9C7013BF97705C5BA390AC
question.
0x28EF6F3ECC860107BD4BDC7FCB42993E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
0x9928A0D86BFF47C1F4396A2307931EC1
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
0xA286DC25BAB0A6E8F2E34451B5056ABB
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
0x0F4446151C86D41E11C389283DCF3EC1
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
0x931E4F24A318380F4B6B3943099B9022
hospital.
0x61A8196F95FE2376E5E25F0F9EB42A77

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
0x58617A3E98025229871E62B2FDB0C71C
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
0x187E1F6D35DB18D9793F9E2CBA6E346A
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
0xFA57F3612B8525E3FD57BF290D2D4F17
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
0xBEF7C03EDB93F6F0ACB1C238D15E27F3
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
0xE95BD2C057E9EED6EDBCFA0C05BCC671
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
0x43949BA33A72E502F5C20A9AA7CE883F
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
0x6AB5D688DA03354A124104F775E190FA
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
0x813FF22251052A01FDAC36AD3D39A89D
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
0xC49B33BDC57E451479928159BA78802A
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
0x1CA5026A4BE28851AEE77646BA501242
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
0xC1F944634C68B96779438B4A31405D0B
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
0x4CE07A777BEBD0D4BA4E3E9E721FAC6B
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
0x4FFEBBB725BAD1B5C22A41F851BC7FC5
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
0x7411CC288E22A471C356D3A5230B486B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
0x703CC1E409E655C442B0E019D07D2F50
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
0x7648F7F91A17AD299D65983AE1774E09
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
0xEF2F340357C6B6A0EEB33726793410A3
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
0x4F00D9B6102E5E49FFD3569CB655B62D
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
0x8E5D71FD4C32DCC0A988CF5097439CE3
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
0xA2709F3485FD0F83D062328E33CF6271
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
0xFB245BAEFD2D63BB176328360D331EC4
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
0x9AEBED9A84520B56F1CE80C8F87F4A3F
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
0xF6A66FE58E614C85539B52E932725EFD
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
0x59D37FE28F8B21A83BD16B9ED8080BBD
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
0x478DB05FC8713F93003693BA52692589
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
0xEA08D7A50D25C732D9A77A798374E39C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
0xFEC40A0E7810B570BD92F32A9418B360
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
0x61669D7E43519EE85866E2B501B9269E
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
0x52BA9E163B82D8D21A09483468AD6DF0
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
0xD5684B21220B3C40DF5B3C4D97572172
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
0x5A4D6E864311E030E47AB24E3F2E75F8
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
0xC1BD51F800E485575708E70945DA7D32
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
0x4EA87F2B13EA6A391797F8FAC92FC27D
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
0x00F2352E05C56849C9469B4B6AA14664
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
0x601AD99AE8B4633DD91067CF855B27AA
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
0x40820CED62341FA807886CEBC671543D
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
0xA19EAC2D6E8BD64DF66A333B058AF61F
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
0x0A8DB3D50BE31AFA9557848735964C05
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
0x1D2B916DB010FFEB0A8C467497546328

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
0x15852167757F3868B112500E1A00BACB
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
0x5BE1D9A1AAB6DBEB3D4B2EDE9F3F96C9
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
0xD1F8CBA0FA1117EF0FE7E6F63FAE8102
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
0x5602330CC3A062E40352935D5193615C
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
0x97667CB04F45C6D905760E6E6A5432CC
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
0xD1DB2C3F6BFCED06F85AC5C6A74A223D
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
0x47FCEBC652DDEA931693AE19A949CB85
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
0x1B6CC47694B893D2FCF4C021D5DE7282
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
0x05CCF4FC42A87492BEDC79B4760E1B3A
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
0xE4C92EB87F664B1B38E5FA35AC82EB56
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
0xD5EA8B7B2E762127A9E57BCEDEDA5F7F
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
0x504938C86F6DF3F5550872E3CC858F48
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
0x2BC42637A88E28D84617AF251DEDC92B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
0x699BCBA495062C16B150B6528EE67449
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
0xC533AA78FD810ED666A65E6E53A1EB86
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
0x3DD1E6FA7E31D85775AA745494694C52
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
0x9821186BB23C901395FA5729DA695AC3
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
0x53AC10454776210EC7B338CDB31F4938
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
0x078176687CE633FD650A0E4A20240CB2
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
0x20A96C38E90DA6A81A79D35162798D7C
higher things.
0x4731DD896E1B8371BE9FA520FF104D2F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
0xFF26366906EB740FD7701A88012ECD88
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
0xEEAEFFA652B2862567B97C2CE3D52A2A
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
0x5C4AE2DF5F6BF325AFBDE504E48ED318
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
0x0C0483C3EDD9C73BF8850676D7512FD1
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
0x6F0D94012C594C9CA7E178EA0840EBCB
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
0xC769BAB2C47CC8F559DFD0DB2754A140
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
0xBBB8C55907EEBCC1D7CB1C6F45991EA1
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
0xFDC329B2DA7D322164618D533BAFC541
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
0xF5B7351595695DB4C9307739D7E460D8
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
0x67BD0BB0155A6D8F7F0EEB57F48D2DDD
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
0xAEB97BF35D938750ABDE044B5928125A
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
0xD33E323B1639672E3C4E9C01CA76E997
alleviate.
0x964A3FA2122F1B2B3778F45AF3ED5D84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
0x5D3D57870B1BB46A02EE5CD82E173659
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
0x5A89241D3168C201CF7E93265B9BCFFF
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
0xFB2CB7DB9E15B684E4A060EECDDEF9F7
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
0xF45C3AC0B41ED6592BE8A5D2CA5F6441
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
0x572AACF44E0BE960B6FB48B054D032DD
verandah.
0x431CC8C4A7115961F51BA15F5FAAF7F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
0x6B760D8AD7CC980591E62F7BD8162ED8
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
0xA9005033C11213AB943242E81BF6C944
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
0x3554684F271EC87E74C514A95B461B53
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
0x8D04B28A41271A38920386FA916ACBB2
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
0xBCF4996362DD26F3A2A9F1245A348E05
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
0x4AD26F6F84717F1D68DF62DC0FDCC5EE
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
0x11F749FCE41811E5AE5D9B466B22C300
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
0x61FBEFFED0C71867CD9420B39BE35F3F
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
0x04462F72C8A1BCC69B96C51E0A752A4B
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
0xAFD0AE28624198EAACF519E59448F661
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
0xDBB4A4F9273E84A5FA643735C33C3C49
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
0x027363B0B64543A5E3546FAA8E57AD2F
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
0xD732107D31AE28DCE31EF9809072C9C9
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
0xB716AD8423DF2A881256226429D5B2A8
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
0x11FC098207E8C0EC9DE65D67A7FE39CE
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
0x7AB4B7574AB7DF3940CED6F768050CCF
done before:--
0xEA0F5C66341B4436079BA83BE3DEF7C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
0xD5AC2D8831DF1AFC69D2190A552EF265
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
0x9D6B0A0278C02ECCAD3918EB1E225FA8
have to go who knows where?"
0xB75C8C8D965D52F3A11CC3E65AE1F9AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
0xA49E1F1753DDCFD8A5C81C79D49C7672
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
0xD72C5281ACE6600C9FF4924DCC50236D
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
0x9C92EB7E626F3762FE9F787E4F033005
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
0x749D4A012462C72D7C1CB8445DA83B9B
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
0x212A3D1B4CEA6D49B8E08F953EF20845
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
0x1BD2FD62F580F3A23EA1CFE40A9C65BA
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
0x6E35427AF238D3D69E10AD39A0B30A4E
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
0x2AAF9DA000EE39A7CDAA7905731A58E9
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
0x9858FB556359DFB828F2F221EAB36A2B
ran up to her.
0x76BAAC16FB4043E66C45CDA83BB349D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How is Helen Burns?"
0xE61E70AB4FCB39765BACF68E6DF734D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very poorly," was the answer.
0xE73384CCFE8F83B5BE0737C48B2FEB94

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
0x6305F39F5E59A98EB9F664D940391722

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what does he say about her?"
0x48AC5C5AC849A97E787C3A974F8301C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He says she'll not be here long."
0x3EB4B46EC681E0DB0C7052BBD37E0409

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
0xFD6EF3AFD7A58E4C8777C1AE406DA6D9
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
0x1D507A83505F8B24FE1621F16A4874B9
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
0xBD3B6E58B8E3023DFF7FDFA1E2271036
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
0x3AF07C7CBA204C1F3A2401ECC2413A50
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
0x40B18F111BD6A51F0B3317639812B665
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
0xA99D3A999ACD49F2AD92BCDC8467C76B
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
0xE8F2F6FCB72E672B8F7C1D6906611852
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
0x84D3A590AB46CE9A2EDDCAFAF2E5A5C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
0xC08D044AA561215AF3E6F3C2D6498A9C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"May I go up and speak to her?"
0x85E203CA75F18BEDBAD4F41C22B7083C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
0x7AE4F51D3B0F90A955C9D92F0CA3944B
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
0x9E12866F5087ED0A805951BDD519A60C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
0x19338EA7D34556FCA626A314F2CFDFEA
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
0x1236F5F474EA0ED05239A1B99B77A6A5
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
0x584D63E5D3292068FADEA294A9B434A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
0x6E678483885BD3E1F73E9F02B6236075
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
0x436A0ED35B0CDFEC5C93DBE010E1078A
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
0x67645D991D3E1220F3302DD2603715F6
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
0x761ACB45360D051C55E7360714E3AB33
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
0x07C66811C54FAA3E4F33FF12C04305D4
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
0xB7EC05C0D88095AF5471BBE8A5113FBD
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
0x0143A1C3FC0585D20391CE5331E1A4D3
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
0xD45E065B39B769E42E3814326D2FD3AD
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
0x31698F9EE76763555318FDD94ACD4FEE
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
0x6835FC43A603D729AC1EAE92B4EF0882
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
0xBB52CB6E3F9D6A891B0A56B0C0E1793A
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
0x9D61087A664E435C4BC3D0D1D70D0993
with her one last word.
0xA2D8C5EDD8FBD6C8F587E34EB7487297

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
0x755ACA9CFA07EAB9608D120B05FDCD71
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
0x651EC539EEF65FDA0EDB5D67F57EEABC
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
0x7EFBD9C2D7E00190AC0545EB8B413D60
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
0xA1888D94E2174205AF80BC693635262A
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
0x11636F6DCEAAFE8C8F391B1C93B94839
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
0xE46D7BA9DD31FAC080FF77016D5C491F
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
0xBCA5EEEAA2EC4137D612AF587F194BF8
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
0x8382C9B77C393D3FD2BDDBA6E6C4381D
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
0x08F340E1B64EBC12A41AD875BD0703B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
0x52D35F52E4BAB8B5A72E093366968E94
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
0x3F54AE9FF1BD40D084CF5D36EF4C9B8F
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
0x5258B5766810CF0D54D9E345DAF2EBA8
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
0x1A63F3DFCC12AA4B2A5C46F32B006851
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
0xCE5178672486E4C6461AAD9E14F77018
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
0x85C5298D2B595814C3FA85C6B0F6742E
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
0x50945115F38C978BB4D5E3410C68632E
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
0x02A1589A919B7EDF983FD997EA715CA6
of seeing a corpse.
0xB499A52AB0EA4367106A0E6D4D5FEDD8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
0xC7D9ED1C79C08977EF627318BEE880F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
0x80FA1C3081F7DCAA67E2F730E3340EE6
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
0xFF8EE8844E67DBF40F43ED888B65A00F
instantly dissipated.
0xF6D8E096A087E6B1AC7B22152A78542F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
0x221714A196B2F5BC9E58302C89C7BC6C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
0x3A31D68E3EB483849A6D829D8F3FB5EA
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
0xFA45E3E6F469468B87832A057A4B6425

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
0x3294DE2EF0C4D82C136186A021B85387
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
0x882B1CB80A377F0B66DBBC31687601C7
old.
0x4AB928454AB92845B103F00A34054357

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
0x27700C9B5721411C1AEC31B50F28263A
strike some minutes since."
0xB2644D20F22D5DF58E0CA727298102C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
0x9D636BF7EAF975906D0ABBEC97512963
sleep till I had spoken to you."
0x23F0CBF9921EE50AC7B45EC1FAD59288

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
0x301C699D438DA83ECC8E60235A2B9F9F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
0x7F9F139C12BC39E7A42FFD88DC67FB75

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
0x3FBCAB9482640528FB732928F6C5614C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
0xDEC2176D0CF13CD54F4CDB9A3D1BB162
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
0x898CA0A1B66A129A4576170682DE187B
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
0x113B535EF1B80CE827AF267F847D5668
whispered--
0xC4740AE6A37051C13CF4DC231BF4C26F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
0xE706CF2FFD29522B02B34CB4BBD72C5E
quilt."
0x72C9C15F72C9C15F3BC4BB72865B7C6D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
0xD82F5C65711DF7D68A5B452D38C4E185
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
0x31F255A4182F1CED3C18D4AA031941F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
0x02E3AE7518806501F1F18A176819CACF
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
0x71BF12577325146CB6103CB5AE6FB501
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
0xB2E9D5ADCD0AF8682FA600256AF426BC
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
0x1CD9875E5665D24F16F03A1E06490F73
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
0xED9A74EFAFA22C0149596C55E49AFFD1
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
0x99A8798B9777EBBD1954362296ECF294
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
0x16743B5C36E112F67BE5DBB19AF3E3F0
been continually at fault."
0xB3CADF4562871DAD028ADF570FFA4742

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
0x196FFD2EBBB38D156E1DA92F6CE9E922

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
0x34C3BC1ED4F269948487D36820F404F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where is God?  What is God?"
0xDAE06F1E8F1C0576B0A2345B78BB0646

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
0x10575C756A14C0502D481D5609C0F11F
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
0xBDEAA495E64D93D94E11776D6465F62F
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
0x37B07D0998A9C4A417F6114F16B48991
reveal Him to me."
0x0DBBD7FFE17C2D9D12C493FA940D74C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
0xD6675FBACB4C7EE8B8EF48F54E0AC4F5
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
0x11B96D1EE20324ACFE089C7F19B2F376

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
0x3569AFDEA36965EE77E7C682A7C13C4E
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
0xF3A755DFCA19F0557ED10F4FD4FC29C8
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
0xBC1EB4596FB807141A68C3E3C45BFFD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
0x9C56E4CC8BFE0DE764C6C7A61C46EAC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
0x5C0E96EA8E0DCAE91BD19BCC884D9277
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
0x938125E11245E6C4DF2CCFD9FF91A848

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
0x3DB7291234F46235659EE9118E143332
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
0x0042AA31CE5C36FE873232850072BEAA
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
0x8D285D24E3263446A0847FEE77CB128D
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
0xA25184D32EB3F3F40242B523A9E6B7FC
tone--
0x7FAF05407FAF05407EE6B065870B0232

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
0xF5D29B340DBBCAE8D19AE0230DBB3E63
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
0x00ED5DAF8B6C4206CB7D99337F49AAD0
near me."
0x9BEFEEE5538D41984C17C019AE2BA943

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
0x56A91A44A9F59DA2D44AFD79F05C6091

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you warm, darling?"
0x1BBD72695241568C5B15005CCF1E93E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night, Jane."
0x0BCA4B04179A71A8F8925E2FA72C5090

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night, Helen."
0xD5619671DBD6541E4B690A92047650D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
0xE3BB2A3C45330AC889B92A9DDB70B2CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
0x63BDFDF6BAAC7F322993FE9C49864D2D
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
0x9670E7251508771CC20F28B58F1C1EC1
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
0x899DCE69C813E585E321D7E426CB8A0C
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
0xE355E4249E7CDAC97ADA580ABAE8A9E8
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
0xFB643ACE2948FC2159210021916130BC
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
0x0D914BB2AF8008034F48AA37D506A0E6
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
0x51A97A5E4AB6449A776A89D64B9B703D
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
0xF543F6C1D7BBD1B136931EC9E15DEC5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
0xEE8E5E9138A778929CCB248AD25749A0
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
0x714C64E238B4EDE58C5A4AC2B5712667
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
0x38D8E9AAA33BEE73376B7DCFF2AD8A63
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
0x79DC63E2DDCC35E502E56A22C9F92127
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
0x3EB9E03050E303C411DDF8357948CE5D
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
0x0799BF2EB82AF75340139C77B2C6BD94
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
0xE0DD9C9EA332FD57CD91F4BB74DD339F
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
0x3955AF7E36D44BF197BD6D34508AAB6A
connection.
0x167E84D57BC2121B355B4812A4D59C5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
0x56BC1066A01A534D5608BCD14E6CACE4
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
0x164FA1D582289B05A984EF9DF0F50828
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
0x85778222C18E58A9C0C55F3C44AE905E
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
0x2F7915EEB50152E1CF35A1D3AF88C475
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
0x33428914BAA488ACA40E565FCE2D5634
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
0x473256F0A83A1BB7960831F149C4CC2B
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
0xDE16B737E84182CE6F1CD39FB7BE8C70
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
0x89283B9B628DB3692BDB2A97E0E58FAF
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
0xE5AFB1A911E25109FEC945F0BC99EE6D
beneficial to the institution.
0x7F49E3D32D5CA58460FCCFB73A45DA5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
0xD1CA3EF25848761639ED105DD4956D17
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
0x3FC5ED1A40591B7A2B127227928EEA0E
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
0x447BA39A0644AE556BEFAB13541EC581
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
0x95AA8E6BB5188987B7BE76E0675914D1
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family

connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
0x5895F731F76503CBD292B7DE7134EB9B
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
0x637EC145A17F116CC9D01DD5D8E80D2C
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
0xBC64707D37981CC1E32F0A3073D64007
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
0xAFA5AFA744C9712E95461427EF413FB9
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
0x25686CFE8E164A7718B1E1C01FBBFF26
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
0x2242D6E583169535FDD7625461D5223F
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
0xC4196C5EFA14FE5DF6D61DC759151FB9
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
0xE72E3343BADCB8A89B3607D90434384F
testimony to its value and importance.
0x301A1A913F9B585E53DB4C1129DA562F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
0x68CB0B8CFD6AF0D431901A8211B2C07C
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
0x1E879DFD61B25318BDF3DB7385928AFF
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
0xE369C41B1C07D78D242F8C3F00F851D2
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
0xB131D134E2F965906EF51593107E123E
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
0x204F0C94B77B19167D886402FF307B00
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
0x9F8BFADD97F0A58AD30440836B1EA6AB
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
0x6AF76586394C24DD27690A1DFFD79415
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
0xC6B3581D8EC7945BA0CA803EAC50D144

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
0xF6E8C328173542207BC6446F3ADF0826
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
0x910D3BFC0BF8EABFDCD3FE3C8FD1ECDC
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
0x66C5134F823E82C2BCD5DBD4DED817DE
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
0x667075101298483C6096D19BD96CFE7B
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
0x2054F8C83C172760416C602FB5B6E016
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
0x0DB100DDD17093754C2B48E14AE3C0C0
county, and consequently was lost to me.
0x08B2A80348805E4ECC1E0E8D376F3574

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
0x6A0C31B653AC49C3AE7FB409E8F1D40D
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
0x39BFEC12FE0224A335790501EF4CFF19
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
0x422698B7B8AABCCA59E42BB816037B01
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
0x08174AB00B0823E887D6F2129B6DEE21
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
0x408A4DB52B010F741C344A2B03A1B354
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
0x566E62A9E7F8B19A6304AA1ACDAC6069
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
0x85C82CACBE9C4CEF06E0226092532DBB
character.
0xF075F97DADCB0BEF39B04042E08BC5B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
0xB9A4067B11780B4030B904DD39F9854F
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
0xB5F914A7D749DB916086B1A50FEBF8B7
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
0x07E9FA2AB346BB274B8839974C08D5F5
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
0xC52181BDEB47CCD77205668896338112
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
0xD447A593BFCBFF830FA83D00C2265BA6
of the occasion.
0x71F909D68E2FE9FE4F88CE6EA87153DF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
0xDBC2C775992FFC3F6BEC9F7736AC54A4
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
0x638111C0C9FE06F9FC11266FE6892347
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
0xEF4B89A40DBD7A08659E41A0FC54D828
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
0xE3AF731EFCF3A96C886C16350231CB9E
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
0x24DDB9A069BEC50C1B4196A3867997EE
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
0x89A2A3171AF73AB6CEDCAA1B5D07597C
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
0xA5D83046C7D4E086A2CD52C2A8B51140
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
0x4215F8ED3CB553B9367D7B92C17DECD0
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
0xF3B3BFD0120451E475D75DA7EFA6E698
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
0x62AF895F564D5A1D0277882908A737A3
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
0xC087C1E38D81037039C199E2CF9F3A2C
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
0xF586918C7014FAAB69A3BF02A2DA44CE
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
0xC53C554DDE5799F4BB9087356D7EC2B5
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
0xC7ADD6FF7088546B38DEEE23AEF1CE09
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
0x2DE1765F18EFDD87B0CDFBC0640DBF64
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
0x10DBA61D4D9E8ACBCE23F230F6DF0444

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
0xB8B7C5B7D1EFD48B3FD446547A3C8FF7
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
0xEB7F127643ECE2789DEFB0F89908DF0E
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
0x23A5A892C98EB52EE626461282BB451C
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
0x7A437A3AF3D3D82E06143446620F182B
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
0x018F300BB748F1B350F9790A977D61B2
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
0xC799B01D1FA4A9131CBC1B511E7120EB
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
0x478621B9931ACB2AEC0FD556E3B297DC
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
0x0FB567EC100BA0E4E9B89F3C5FCA9588
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
0x4E816E1B06A423FDC60FFBC6A0CBB429
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
0xE500C3FA7579BEB73724533954FEC99B
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
0xC60BA1F25464CB97BDAA63670F93505E
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
0x568476F0C9AFF23D71A5556EA42D921C
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
0xE29808E1BF951ABB11AE63EE749030BA
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
0x03168A2E2C673687C0050AE01D0B14B6
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
0x548E39258C3C346B6FBF7DB4140AD5CF
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
0x42CCDEBA664BF6ADA5DE25539B87D7D1
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
0xBE104153FB782C4A39E8E46C9C4791A0
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
0x7E065EFF05D7857A89292758834ADC67
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
0x483D10CD117FA4A530FA22BC656EDF6E
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
0x80D579F36DA6C708F96A451F9EB56706
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
0x1E2BFEB358A9C15EEA0B58F6099557EE
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
0xBBDE638E30812BA21FC148ECFEC83FDF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
0x0A61DF0956442EF2EF03500CAF3B8943

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
0x595D61AD5F117C5134B93F723DA66315
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
0xFD8E357A3E7DE61D861CBDC6B00924E0
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
0x6EEF7E23CC9B60E2C88EA9C6CEC15006
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
0x0CFEA09BFCB03BF62ACD99A782B3DCA4
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
0x4C64C07727942C1D35CA6153D2D03828
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
0xB429AB506DEB5D4598D48F146E0CE3CC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
0xA6935C207A361BA7808414269D8DD3E4
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
0xDA99A93049E4CFB050C8275605874B17
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
0x913D10599C785829D9FB909CF14BC3E4
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
0xFE2A9B31B20EDAA7E9BFFDBCDAABC515
instantly revived.
0xE8F1AE6CD71517367727EEA329C37FE1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
0xDBDEA32758BA6AAFE711343A12B24447
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
0x0F616EC5075A2B3B4EE751F0EB4710BF
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
0x59A8810869F559FB033A97E3F29AA9E0
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
0x0D089A1B86131A20917750AE44E3FF0E
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
0xF8BAD68621AE45FC4A2636AD98E87E26
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
0x98F6981C8B0AACB664C1442483D16FD4
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
0xC0AE36DCEEAA8064261009C159A85C53
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
0x21220A4A6EC002446DE9396A3FD88771
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
0x65261D9C5C15D933F5CD593EE13AFB3B
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
0x9147105C39CD7C03665738AB55581ABE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
0x4DA9C2811F4AEEB13382EFF1C702EC69
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
0xE6A009A2118621E7BE0F8D1CF8E64763
think_ again with all my might.
0xA6F485A7EA555443599623257E436237

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
0xAE33C6A0FA3AD7A626DFCE4DB9A5A394
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
0x9B7FCD07862C23F4EA97BEECBA9E2E8B
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
0x5C9A2CF47F7638E630161364A5FCB160
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
0xE0A15C32E9E0D155F829975438336206
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
0x9375453E227AFF2C8EDB9F8C13E87306
their resource?"
0x4D32FAD5BCF7F53B168D4EE99784A0BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
0xA1883771B081F3043F88A34822387DAC
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
0xAD6A8E121B4792561EB788F534B26AF1
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
0x38BB7610B4E665B35AB369CDE4ECA838
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
0x5F627B4C13688A2EA2AD0F2446585B15
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
0xC0ACF71190ADACFDD73BE9C1224B34BC
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
0xE55A356439A38EC79791F21C487B8BD6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
0x3976B6EDB90FC29F568BEF2E8F85422F
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
0x6F560D900E83010F8BC1A0C4168E9A54
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
0x8287FFCF4A0C96785CCFC52CC9DFE4BD

0x45C786B0F081C8E4F7E1F37F1DDD1915

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
0x211E997A5BA51CF528D996EAB5452AD6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
0x29E24ABADEF90B60362A409DE5C1F99C
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
0x951A4FE96ECFDDB784B82E5D5E5C4754
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
0x5CF9488EB8F5DD5AF4E85EF1AF7EA28D
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
0xB1C7C1A7356C801B1801E592AB06D6AB
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
0xD54DA63D47EF7A94FA3A73315210BBB6
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
0x224B17EE714CD94839D120D2B1426146

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
0x970CDA869BA9470B388DD2D77A8C09A2
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
0x613FF04CD6AFB2A52E7A8FD450591C47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
0xE8EF45B7DCD01C0A3123B9F050B58FB0
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
0xFCDE50C1D3DA2A17F53135B32FF42CA6
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
0xEA96C525A24250E698E56CA6DC8888A5
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
0xBECD09CBE3D8830E7E8B5F999D949A78
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
0xF0EF7297BFC718AD7E1140FAC8E61113
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
0xE4678159CB8546E3EBC79D41E0CB8E15
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
0xC53DB5CE0224E378E250CFD9A8595F8C
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
0xECEBC748D4B93FFAAF55B0C5AC100D21
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
0xE05F446EB76AB039EC51E5660BFFA3F8
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
0x0E67CAFBA5E403AD145BEDD8C7B27EAC
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
0x1542DD051D08CF567FC624F418F77E8F
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
0xA119A383942E3475180F84A75ADD57BA
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
0x1FA7C43EC3E883056C41D88005BB064A
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
0x7157590F147D8944255CD64D33F1BEFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
0xBBA0D75BF8E9B915B3CD61F2D3BFCDAD
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
0x0F97A56A3D2EE9FA895E29E4B19491A6
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
0x8389C8FC3DA084D3903D4055F3CCA783
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
0x1E19D84B5FA4B54FC59DD6006AD74944
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
0x223B707C2BFA158E11FFF32F6F42D98F
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
0xC15191AC0A9397B36531BA47957F0941
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
0xB19B2E0E49647D73F9B299B202C7F7B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
0x62230DBCAE86FD0370DDA361EA40AFE9
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
0x2A6749305E15DC6C09E45B39DB311C5F
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
0x72179EC799898DFE419806A58463C8C1
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
0x0F302B346780DC87CE9C82A46F3AB54F
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
0xE3C23967FB12C7825A92B01C82DFCA5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
0xB24BA698488FF5E9C20C124527D15B7A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
0x7CD923D32CB87C3243F7E5BACD189D55
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
0xC4198E98A546D9EDD56ECBFC5A62AF14
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
0x297F936046595ACF0CD31D065C662906
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
0x1BE0FAA7ADC938A8698AB690AA320162
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
0xC358D38F6EEDE086AAAA9B8D59396353

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
0x40A403DB2D6545684FEAFD6249A9083B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
0x7043C2350981D2E51988073C731EA299
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
0x70E55568A0DF4A414AB65F8E808F0677
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
0x26F91EC5A7D589BDEF66247D3D38038F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
0xF351EE3BD96D157834F14DFC371A0534
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
0x99FB8CAE177D469049E67483E7C60A57
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
0xC5A0FB609F80A9D98C54A2E94AA932B3
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
0x3442098ECC9EE03352F0D4EE9827AF12
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
0x2441747E78A51DDD569B89B5938C7441
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
0x820EE1D88527859DC9C3E74EB44A9E4A
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
0x0A2BB324ACAC85C7B61E90296C60A861
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
0x01CBCE2941C94F6976311D5140BA2F9B
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
0x527A8AD92410E8DDEDA6F4D788FF88FB
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
0xF13BA14FCA4B81A50D74E812A70D6C49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
0xDB27B0C2A165522A9092103DE47D1409

0x1AB44BD299A3B6EB1877E23D8C759413
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
0x982039F31DACDAAB467192F2D1B24900
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten

"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
0xA06F440099677EEF0A803F86C0BCC94A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
0x7CC7E64F60EABAB341273927FB7773AE
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
0x5B4AA99CB5ADF22C0F803091DD0FC51A
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
0x2EBDD47147568EFD0BCA9F0467B8BBFE
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
0x8AA132F947B099E1DD3C3EE4CBA4C1CC
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
0x4C77D454544E98DA6190B2F4BACF84BA
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
0x2A3E496DE1F03A60CC0CEB3DC855C893
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
0x73E4E173E6DBEC8B8A9B84001F57CDF0
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
0xA294E55CB1E79437EF05E7EFA86DAB95
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
0x6AA0A2E63F91B64281BCAAA803D576BD
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
0xDBCD4ADA859921C14FA37048890FC7B7
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
0x3C8C0A5AD31D82B6ADF2B46319E9DC2E
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
0x2A6DC3C428DA1DE7017C4B11CE5296CD
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
0xBC5ECFCF2B243DFD4FA1C944E6A21C40
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
0x3F9D47472FC9FB6F4E260FEB5C180764
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
0x3B6067BB8A7200001882CBF6861C482B
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
0xA1EFC64296F040748DD9B011C5FACA42
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
0xE7FCBCC062D9F70EF802701DF621ADEB
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
0x986CACC9D98809732861C2DFA3E236FF
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
0xC5C0A67A01D422728E79ABFA066DC06E
probably, be a good way from the town."
0xC75A3B91C2BB8C92CE7DB5FC60BDF4C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
0xF6714FF1B8A30628A20AC4DA6DB18959

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
0xE42E3F69B193D66176126A03AD10372F
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
0x266A08989B941466F2C10DE6E4A8EF20
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
0x8AAF3562A66DF3FF57E228D8C5046BFE
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
0xA4F247800C6174B949670A698F7AAEEF
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
0x71130972554002F8970F5505C0080BBD
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
0x9FDE027387D85D8AB29C8B29432CC9D2
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
0x0E9B08FABBAA9DB81B43EE37178C8A70
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
0xB5E42E9C3565D177630996A8D97A6CAC
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
0x180095E5AD5594C9D9F30317191F4600
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
0x295ACD75A54ED842A0FEE8E296D0D048
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
0xB6B2139CC0DA628900CD282D35CA33C5
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
0xE23E0B479D34F8FBD14BFC3A5A201ADD
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
0xB2869EC7282424A887FA7CBF142E632D
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
0x0BDD0E816921BDE625C08B54A4CB640B
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
0xDE0AB1F5607DA1F1A1F0D68C9E7FC14A
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
0x4D1783831A30B6F67C1E4C32086E4C6A
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
0x9BB1A3D4ACA15BA759E0F02926D92D7F
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
0xF859AE2D255947E5B8BC527323FF77B3
forthwith be furnished me.
0x1F153865DE5B0DC2D30567AFE0508A6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
0x54794922B1FBDE8419CB9D6405D883D7
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
0x17ECE3658777D2BFE78A5EF010C8F376
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
0x9BD8EEEB47F8B4E2971EEE160D86E9FC
assuming the post of governess in her house.
0x1281B503EE063C777192EE6010BB920D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
0x81D324025BFF0401D874D326D18EDEFF
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
0x833783E5CD2496314229B3F853F94182
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
0xFD2EA608673DCD2C96663A231FC61E70
years ago from Gateshead.
0x7A3E53EA6BFA3129BB28F4D34F78BE85

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
0xDD6ABA1EEF8411B95244EE7B9B8F4D7C
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
0x0107388EC2C161EA32B4F865AD9AF563
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
0xD422E727D9DA9409289AE503D6A2DBAD
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
0x01AF4AFC2430D2911543A09A43AF9641
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
0xDBD5C885D6B554B974EF6F870D3A897A
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
0xE66349F13A0D28560AA6A083E167C788
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
0xA31AFB4235B8ACB44DA51635389D6E25
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
0xA038037928658D060016A9805BB9BD1A
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
0xD20B269395980F92DA4B486394520C9B
while the change was being accomplished.
0x42F2B6F16675E0888211C481BE9239ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
0xF154DD3D5E475E57E8CCFB1B0E6081B9
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
0x3380E85E56BA7C1C51C0A5BDF2D45933

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
0x33BFBEF1A313A610D369AA79696BD21D
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
0xC31C4658189ABA72EAA8C264B5D671CA
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
0x09B8CD0A76FC0CF728BF701364013E60

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
0x41BF81D1CD7FBDD77AA4E86C843AF0CE
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
0xD28203CD6321C84C68EE2CD60D4E87DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
0x04009352813176ECCE82921393D2ECBF
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
0x32F7941ED69B3C3C2B1B6098214AA79E
complexion.
0x4F252A613961F4EE575BE260E04B3CFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
0x6D14F1F526752594F96DF40DA8100DEA
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
0xE10D0CF3079308671961A3F07FC4877E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
0xB1D52B6419BC984417FFE2750001D45E
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
0xE6BD1C65DDBDC9D667F5294949420A90
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
0xF63C2AE393BF5C75D046735C49D6C8C3
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
0x0D03C950E13D6C57CB3870064D41E7E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
0x373374DE74C641E34ED6C6218B73123B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
0xF6F0A63C240AB2157C5D0EA0101BFC5F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
0x7808D92A12BC7AF7E0FBB633564DB1B8
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
0xFA1CD3C2FA7C53813D98DD1B5FCFFEBC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
0x764CCDD9563F0AFD47135ADFD3082F14

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
0x37FF7B59110D34D63E62260011267EDF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
0x03B0FF0C81D869C858F8D2BCCA2303F9
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
0xC8A8E8917C4AC29E8917AD6EABEABD73
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
0xEA084EEA62B74C188B318E77EFA90442

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
0xAC1D798A576761D6DBB6BB96E4E85226
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
0x9E730F79D096C62B39085A75AC044999
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
0xCEA550D0326BD9852E3CC1D801494941
would make two of you in breadth."
0x8866E6B5E546C43659822103B83F2845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
0xF87453020587F00DA5E2EB34E4686D09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
0xFE1E65365A2E2722840342AA24ACC5E4
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
0xB76A6A7155796AB38A6E07432B3357FC
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
0x1484DC5811C39EFF60E9958E950AE98B
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
0x0CFC7306FE6FC655606FE9613B1896F8
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
0x446E05FBF9F7BFD0DE668DFF148060D1
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
0x05641112D8D360B5313A4B43546A69C5
quarrelling--"
0x1E1CCC8CEA0D174AF522A570EC5F12F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
0x1474C5B0453A7F62A663BF7F8454FDF0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
0xFFF9E4792A6BDCFE89FAAE73C58E06DC
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
0x8028FF48A0272C1FFD01451F3D672B40
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
0x94B718B2CED688DF441B3A5195BFDF10
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
0x1C3B3FD3CD70E8FE2B149C7EA8D34642

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What does he look like?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
0xA1F5E73906DC54DE01821E7DEF312BD0
has such thick lips."
0xF5D496A877E52191A569EDAFCEEC903E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And Mrs. Reed?"
0x96D6B2B673CA0A325167D1AE96F34A06

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
0x98C8D07046DE8A46D5A783E09E236872
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
0x0E551382C13A397C063BBC3761883AC7
a deal of money."
0x5B431E15BD40B9228C4A28F4A94CC315

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
0xF2BDEC42D2AFC8DC792E942B8B42B3EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
0xF97739C9FEF851DAD939DF9234951982
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
0xBE56A27CB28F05AE1207B8D62C9CB64A
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
0xB854EF6DD90326189EB378D6D01783F0
you were quite out of my reach."
0x42176474C6E63C031469A507EFC42395

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
0x7B9E7A3EF220CD4DB79F802D092BF86A
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
0xB97EEB84C822B1BA5622E5BC1BB35821
shape denote admiration.
0xAD701941DF2FB93FD3BDD734A0B1AFA0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
0x15241F0325ECE4208EE25E0CEAD9C6F9
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
0x4EB4F50291648DB126F5444B5E9CE4F5
a child."
0x37124FD7A04B2FBAB56CF8D335A95E55

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
0x25AAEB7F34817AC541CCAC7B1D0AC996
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
0x42811254081356ABFAF2508FB1D50F33
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
0x0F210AA69DED4593DFB29365DFB2E618
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
0x8624BDD74B0116E707AD8C5DD1C88588

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
0xCE497E0E16D03743589C40576542B0F0
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
0x334BAB379858E6C774C23517B102C11C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A little."
0xDB8C90F327D4C535CB7917203056A50B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
0xB1749E067578C21E23DEDCC70FA1F43A
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
0x1326ED096593BA1C1F41D89911CD1707
charmed.
0x99D928BDB909AE415853E20E520D415D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
0x5462CBA6716F2D8488BF53127A68BD3C
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
0x44721F4B501CFF4B6A20ECF172D82CAC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
0x3457F684283F4852BEA95411F1E994BC
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
0x7CA4268C3C4A6474D0D9720C9F492449
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
0xD6EB90B565C6076E93A44F0C61206091
and which she had framed and glazed.
0x6A71A5E290A14D8BC8E14B85EDCC9CCD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
0x07A968176583666FBC59BD599B4DB5DD
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
0xB8FDD83DA4837B67BD9ADBCF298C73CA
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
0x530CCCF77EB058224D8DBE7FCC0B32C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
0x8BEA41D5B6EDD06E7FDCDC75F91DD7FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
0x3B08C40AA7466F043766A0B2505BF71B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I can."
0x1F4120212518F6F3B771651B459C6678

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
0xF17BDF2B04602FD2ECF8FD6C2F1C14F3
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
0xEABEC0543CBC4C6B6D8017B53E3AA44A
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
0x3A32B4277E9ACFD63C9565972ACF8F7C
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
0x63717F866D6B02CDD7F92372F4979D68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never in my life."
0x34662548DF84E5DEB5098D04ED8B028C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
0x3B8E5D67D48B1BE9A104128260BFD0E0
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
0x39173CF851D7B75AD730A06C13EADD7D
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
0x4F7F52F97E4E679EBA7DF90E4E5F99F2
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
0xFC651649F402E594E1279E3C827EB5A2
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
0x6465E0D265335D0684C4C9F124A87F19
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
0xD9F8B688CDEEBC8F38CD4A397C0A04E1
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
0x1A5BCAE738133415F22AD055744AB858
father's brother."
0xEFE20DB56757608787F65FED64EC47AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
0x401688C3DF7342AB42601B192768D67F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
0x2CE6E1F9A95720851ACD8ABF63EDC2E8
tell me--"
0x72E5907AE7213B96E83C58B4D8C125C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madeira?" I suggested.
0x9FAD73F93E030B4019AB0B0F98B2F488

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
0x645B523C00DB6ACEAB64FD3E1303C26F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"So he went?"
0xDE7B9C15E2370249860D7CFC167D54B7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
0xFF5D840BB67ADAC13D6FC3BD60D52DBA
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
0x3DF3A90D7BF6C79853FA8554128AF6AA
believes he was a wine-merchant."
0x464454085BF98A6BC23C16917B06472E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
0x2836050AD64816C25821A0DE410FD1BF
wine-merchant."
0xC7CBB22E7B51C6D92AB2CDF0416514C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
0x54B307D2F99FAB31C2F3873D3427904C
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
0xE9B09842300E5CD6E628E905F34E4028
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
0x526D697269500832CCA078CC30E220C2
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
0xF02233402A8C8D5BD9FEB536D84E831A
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
0x4DCB377918755EA3B114B5C1DD32D991
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
0xB32193FD37B495F44AE98AB786B6F6CA
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.

CHAPTER XI
0x818EBEA0AA999463ACB4AA25E4FDE463

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
0x579A8F64374ADF52A5540D89FB2FB2A1
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
0x5F348CDA5E143AD9AD37BE84D01AD674
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
0x76F03DCDE859A5C238EA942DDD94A8EA
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
0xA8A38DFAF6C87E3A5152AAB602862642
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
0x250359D05DF2172F439785B58E0D30DC
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
0x622468D53C56D101D8A8CA953E2EC6C5
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
0x2DFADA27A0AAD0171D51D535091B153B
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
0x2EFC2B1FB8841CEFFF7A17CF13EFA91E
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
0xD9FA18EB6096B3E028DBAB06E71D264B
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
0xB37ED1E861B78F2D635024A44F2604F4
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
0xD20B0506A1039BE58F5A8CFEE1721673
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
0xBA7CB2996D61A1BF2A54152298027BA1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
0xF7FC9D747613CA99CF1FE773C91D3A7C
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
0xD2D941C8A7478A1944248342A133493A
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
0x4464FA0DF3DF611FF5E9B0913FD7DA30
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
0xA54C1FDAFD00D1C9B03957BF8D95561D
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
0x9A34EFC1A1923E550573EE5B60134C1A
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
0x387AF27698191A8201AF1C0D5B047185
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
0xA8C4FEF34A15D5C199D8D8A7BBA1A5C2
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
0x470CA271AFF9739EC84E1E0585EA81AB
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
0xA276DBE570BDACC9CA20B0C22915EE18
troubling my thoughts.
0x0E19570BB42B970BAC68505CA51406AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
0xDDBDA267F4115C42795441DDE0C1F833
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
0xCEF047D77DA263C424589EB0F8170028
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
0xA46614D7484DF2FC92092442EA989483
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
0xC486291F019C7F06691673A6430D0CA5
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
0x65392C996EF5F573BCB00186B7232E2C
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
0xBF99E94F84680ED4EBD4006C39E09DAE
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
0xC87C84596B25530AA886F2C74EEF6384
the bell.
0x1BE064A16414E66333F7FE5CC06710EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
0xC344871F21F5ECD78F2535179FE0A25A
the waiter who answered the summons.
0x8BD7E454A0766000B652371FD4BF87B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
0x4F2F5921159E94D45AE90694317BD450
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
0xB755B8260B898C2F6FDCDB5938D373AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
0x735A3D01C4E1EF1FF091782D91E7E84D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Person here waiting for you."
0x42B494987F4FF4B15C3B293AB0A5D442

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
0x29E02D1F000DE4064DFE093BE37DA401
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
0x5DDF86978D48F5DE696441C39C3DF3D9
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
0x66799D18783F31BB8DBD76FFCF829541

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
0x6931DE0C0D045D3CE188B9D2B5FB4FD0
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
0x2E756A54FABA3764360EBB8F2781D3D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
0x572102296A1DCB205CBBBED16F3EA1D7
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
0xEEEA4AB9FBD906BAD71ECCD3119DDA1C
Thornfield.
0x7B03AA125E1684AA84CE1DFA07C95427

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A matter of six miles."
0x371D79FC0AF659CD56AB06CFC5C6C496

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
0xE04A2BF3483359496665B8B41079B402

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Happen an hour and a half."
0x52648A913D95072B4842289F301D10FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
0x29980698B90C4BEC92D0D231D5D33093
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
0xB49854381CFD0C0091F96261CC6F0B41
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
0xCBCA3397380B0669F42115C6ADA61458
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
0xCF8F14DDE12D70A9E8D9C59B00E19ED2
much at my ease.
0xE2ED2677832305D83F4ED034FB171965

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
0xCDF2663BFBB1D77F5D05C6EB49C06F88
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
0xFBB59571512F65FF7B4CA994C180B1CB
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
0x663F5046D86CA0B2E688D511BBE7D0A2
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
0x7A394FCECA4528520F92D3458D937933
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
0xFD2288DE860BB89EDDDF3C3975AC2300
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
0x7EF1D091C6483861F1FA75CF1991C034
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
0xDAD400D8E4E7A9CAD4576F7854A07B76
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
0xC04B9337E0EB36B94FBB58F1BD933745
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
0xDE581A1D3EB50BBA1CFD26DD468715C3
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
0x6C57455F41CC6504516D0A70411EC78F
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
0x63C0AC74D56B48CDA69AB4C473E737A3
road now, I wonder?"
0xA79C47504EBFD368A3041B139DDA330F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
0xE611A65769F202EC14FDECDC8A1D3FA9
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
0x8BDEF8B381BA4738BE9A792E7AE5F34E
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
0xB6EC778520402337ED0255ED7E81E5ED
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
0x40A32D375EC91D0E05A347BB83C518D1
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
0x1C6A3DE12DD1818EA003A674495994A7
more stirring, less romantic.
0x65AEC163253EE668832EB548DD66CA65

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
0xAEFB52D12A40C65C8AD2638C19486E7B
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
0x8F4DB99CC654823B86EC5532546DC7FF
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
0x7AC14671D57D177F1C9685E83F7719EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
0x1B00E86EBD7F84ADDDA15F5BA4FC7BDB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
0x1B3586F6DB7C43572F2C1DBD890CBD4D
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
0xE7264A141C91466A6034D2A3F2B8421A
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
0x2E36EC8E1F23BD59DC3DCA00AC18A6A9
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
0x073A1F8A0D6818E3C043CD33CCE68061
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
0x51722E092F37CA53C0838F80D59586EA
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
0x8F399C0BAD56C2AE834A76D31F254449
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
0x2778DDB636E5162B7B9444108513749C
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
0x9663FBCC122DBB0B0762C949448093B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
0x5667EC614470DC2CD81C639FF0B9C595
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
0x81A1B041EEA227320C2DFD5C5E779A47
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
0x93041FB5BFD4E0EF77299121603E0D5C
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
0x767800FCE8602F65FA2BA4C961896745
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
0xB515A7D760778D7DE2C9E067AE240D94
itself to my view.
0x5FF0D65399C5DFE3982F14CDDA096488

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
0x4CF1BBECB7A1B7576A2BD958EF141C60
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
0xF79583094D58F5B7C47EF08F5C37F466
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
0xF146F4E709FBFA55FB41560557027E6B
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
0x140668EF03ADC66533E2D6C8B2F1AF9A
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
0x2CFC44C2D5E5E6B2B473D575E6B18B18
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
0x1E9264D46CCCA371D187D82DEEEBCCE0
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
0x28C5EEBAD6B3CCEF261C19DE4EC6694B
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
0xDCCDBD6AB83077081D7F629DDDD3ABA3
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
0x823EDC5E285C711B8938118FC83EA943
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
0xB767B11428B328428E3D0E02DDA831FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
0xE341A4445B4E0741029709B08A80A34A
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
0x10D1B7A5392E2517B7CF611C0DB2A09D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
0x4459F7CC7DC95EC9DAF5FF449F1435C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
0x6D415A381E62A08FE5B88A09236E14D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
0x689A7757C76B81FF0512DFF93072C174
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
0x632D3F3F4AE78293C39B7DF118B32D8A
trouble.
0xF3F2A94E6CFE40DFF5CC9D05A00CE723

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
0xB6F9C26E7519123457CB49F83F825768
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
0x3AB0E55777AE40CF4A3F04FA43E88600
the keys of the storeroom."
0xBF9E540B14315FC82F6F8B93CA237231

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
0x78B63DC4EB8A2130F2A4F510DD1A387F
delivered them to the servant.
0x60BF7BCD033034CCC208493610E1CF6C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
0xAE52C8032E555C7E8FC33E721E15BEB5
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
0xEFAFB53E1FCC14E7AF624F86BD8FE550

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, ma'am."
0xE5287A4AB47BA5E024CE82E921B895FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
0x9DB02E1D9D8708A4CE9B24AE1D37CA5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
0xB074F288BCE09DD8DFC4B4750D2BE26C
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
0xE402F72AC4F1F67E65C8C72B3CA7E54B
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
0x4834EBE87434726822194A5175B4E893
too soon."
0xE658952452B30ACEB42F9AA067473CF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
0xC4F6B1F6562021B2DAC92CF4A2A46D94
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
0xC2B1AC70D9B2983F3AFC9E96EFA908C2
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
0x0A958DF7BE08DD64E98D5BB31E8CD845
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
0xF2C721941092068676E4F63F42D23F05
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
0x2BB900B05CC6041FB21894BEF8C30019
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
0x0E9118FCE88FDBC8AD6429EEA8D3F48E
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
0xAF371A2B76EBD3148F520F059F11549C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
0x8074152D5C5D260B6661DB7AA2F10A72
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
0x9F022EA556AF9DCB6295B8BD8EEC1CB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
0xDF55EB686AA829BEA6B01535F89DF988
approaching her ear to my mouth.
0x1B032696E6C3DFA7C66CF2199CC89326

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I repeated the question more distinctly.
0x8B74CAE07035255A334F8C0A112F3D8A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
0x4BAD4104FA782B6A95C9D09AE92303A5
future pupil."
0x474832A68A4B66F5C7F3500EE74530E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
0xE8D83D8D503C3E2D1591FA16FD92A5EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No,--I have no family."
0x3E00C292391F3C95C46FE2B52EC96923

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
0xDE28F5F9FA37556D5E86261324708A63
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
0x50F384ED02516CDC911048022DA374F7
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
0xE038CE021A6DD50ED82C208BB235FFA7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
0xC164906BF2E7D5197C9CD401A415B399
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
0xEDED2A572A53C16D205FCB1214B90AAD
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
0xBD479F9DD02A87E5BAB92370D99509FD
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
0x1B763A48DD7659C02368C8C46F639089
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
0x0B8A941437F35A22669A4507A2CB835E
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
0x19E38D2DFCAF28788EF1BCA0349B0F41
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
0xEECCBEF96BB0978899EB5260175EE2F7
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
0xCC6D3B63914FB21A6FFDDFD8045F0EAB
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
0x0F351A8BC810EFAC483CBAA49F085773
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
0x78E70150B42F113E492F2F24411276FC
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
0xA97E7F1FF845E48D9A0911318C22DD3F
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
0x42BC036DAB9A22485253E8CD604EAE8A
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
0xEC578CD4759DC864A1D84977CCB23AA9
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
0x50BD1FDE2914DA8CD77A6729EAB0F11B
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
0xC1F3D89C9790BFC8EE5AFB2F89981DE6
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
0xB51C66A2093AA7CE99A646444BFF4A11
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
0x0207FFB77908F3BD9396BBB20B6AFD04
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
0x88F83A6D336ADB21C6B3E054837A4BDD
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
0xC285BA48B77A99E5C6BE9DF96D058BB6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
0x6BAFC2CB77D86FFA71763C20EA691E28
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
0xA2F9C6123442B8D7D06FC3EA0A7C36BE
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
0xEF59E91703D41362FDBE3900D345EC6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
0x067ED25C446E858B0493AD4349395F3E
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
0x3DD30CBF4C94540CF15B8CD60CC9AAE1
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
0xA577BC4282F8401F0D80BC4C87115A54
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
0x1C7AE15F707299F50A5C42A01786A25B
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
0x80628E6DE2866F11A5F7E52360A8E673
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
0xE5CBE3E17480C8E5F7CE99C3BE2E4FAA
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
0xFB0D2F79D3C64EEF27E9D8963902B922

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
0x46F59ABB9EC60E45F9A61935C3838B59
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
0x5782CBECE0AC86D8646241CAD69855A8
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
0x2F52BB48DF6FC0704F757FA52EC40D4C
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
0xFCA1AA68D85B42F628AA95DADC7BF191
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
0x80105DB9C4DE9F495225FE8773A5E11A
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
0xD9726F51C513E1570094E84E8538C8E3
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
0x16BBCCA70B4D315A475F546078EBEB15
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
0x675CFD0A572BF04823AC4CDBF555F1D8
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
0x588DC9EF240FF20C1B95981F456F78EA
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
0xB3B3DEEBDA0788EBE79DF9A87C2BBBA7
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
0x5F778B2FACC7DD01808E331731041C31

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
0x1C6C4773170F56E3D4E9CE7CF7CE1D8B
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
0x25BCA040943457C5E78C3E78161C3AD2
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
0xA9EB31BAC65317B7DE02D03FCD3C2BCA
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
0x60EF330CCCB5B74F4CF0790CDA460024
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
0xC12A43128D734A69017B57D7DF26CD1D
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
0x7D81E433930CA2355B049B39476730BB
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
0x7AD0971AF068997E7A182032B4B195F4
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
0x254BF429EF20E6F35CD9CCC73F00FD1C
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
0x035C426C71FAA07526369277C7B50784
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
0x0C43A3C1C626704CD02CB414AC6A968D
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
0x767A7070CFCED737321AB59C3A5C94EB
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
0xAE067D32384AE5569EE60A77B2021EA2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
0x828C1179172150907B80F608B7E0C551
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
0x3E5841169BAFF52D79F697DEF7F608F9
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
0xDF015BF11F2A30930D619F62664548B9
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
0x76B9B8E9E2FA31BF821FE8FD6FAC1A5A
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
0xD185004EBBFAF556B60B50CDB51FF7B3
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
0xFF4D261E7CBF8635128F010355597574
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
0x20E3732ADC4013BC219D8AC97D953C7A
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
0x42DA54E6DC87CC7E3B4F802E5C67878F
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
0x8B56CD6080C8D862EEE9AADBCACED7FC
an indefinite future period.
0x9E4DB70E1723DFD99A7CCA2398D16AA5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
0xF6E30268DAD9F2FC58966C98FAE67C90
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
0x2553E023DB5587FE1D25DA6F3192F47F
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
0x34472BE82DCE89A54475D5A7A0F53B2C
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
0x56AB4B7996756CFC266E39054C8D3E30
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
0x632AB19DD997AED8DECBC87E934B2A7E
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
0x2063828AACABD874CE4147B7A4A42EA3
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
0xB2530AAE0BAC6A5CE894C93BD65FD008
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
0xF17CAC153759378A40D6BCD354898BA9
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
0xFE614878018D0DF0A29FAD4C4448AFB3
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
0xDF163447794711406C8C0A636B69C5A7
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
0x0473B737C19F482B370AAF5A5AE54578
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
0x5C927872A214224FD6F8042F480CF7A0
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
0x610BD084C79DCF79BA250C44790FAF10
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
0xB40A28EEEBF72C09D4614637605821FD
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
0x05280299ED0DB3EE8A494321EE795706
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
0x74A26346AAC3D42B48BC60BB8F9388B5
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
0xDF07676FFF384CA4F37A3FF68FB5EDF0
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
0x58907A83E38E417FCD758572A9C19BF3
toilet table, I ventured forth.
0x978B6E42AA9A6725A906D3862831AD0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
0x9E2706C1B090BCA3357A24667D3DB798
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
0xA4DC96392ED6D4E8C3BC0A9202B2DC30
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
0x5CE43575C99EEF56A665ED63B8C73519
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
0x5DB817F126576F40E3446CC08E5375A2
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
0xB7BF060C24B44C8F2376FD1D3ED4ECFE
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
0xDFD695EB1C822066A6FCF0D3E28939D4
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
0xB00D3DA956162CA17A9811D190C9D4CC
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
0x60BB3C1D687A1253386D22A801C8E41B
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
0xB3490D16DE7F182FF0968E22630E8FDE
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
0x69439617427D433A30F52F11C8C12C50
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
0x5EA5FA09E56AE5D53E6DB9419B190D09
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
0xE0641D1EB386049C4656BF22F82349E2
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
0x4FA33AD30E3DF1D7B461C33E5EC178D5
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
0x1B046BDBCC0B5B9158FF223772CAE7A5
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
0xA5A61FD9F3FA5EF473640A43D1969486
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
0x42023E09B0797508366AE08CD9DCBA70
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
0x1C42008441D577E942235427E3083A32
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
0xAE2DE3458FAC85058559ED02BA232169
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
0x5DA2B03D51A5823426A05488F934ABE7
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
0x4BA63B16B36EA95E683CBEC9FEB05F32
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
0xCA0106DAB9A94D69784B349899DDD517
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
0x7D58671DA9473C322725C54006986FDD
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
0x68878912612EE62C0C248EA3ACB55109
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
0xA6045AD549B157A633368A9111EE0F46
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
0x9F0EB6DD226218E68A130DC7FF22D20C
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
0x49E076D2CA905BEAD6CA3B933DAECAB0
house and gates.
0x62895C3CA6CCB15E8F7125EB6BE31F8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
0x594A8BEEDFA75D6DCEFF2CAC4A163636
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
0xEF77D89625EA2C237E77B418307552EE
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
0xCAC08037D87075F774301E89C2C81EBA
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
0xB98F57AB1C0003E4D10A4EAE741EE77D
appeared at the door.
0x7CC1C9A2500985F5E08A9A404D570D00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
0x729D15EDA819B4540C71E2A9D7E077F7
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
0x2BFF34E7721D17EC6F8E86220965CF79

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
0x8DF17EC153E604B509BC02054120BBDB
much.
0xFF2A218BFF2A218B71484715C3B4484C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
0x457B591FA59AA95CD4D5F3DED36E3A86
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
0x68BDEAF0FC6481AFD745B7ACB59460D5
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
0xB693BCDC53E2FEEF9E3E0337DD9C9878
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
0x60B79DCFC08FAE87F3393067A9831F57

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
0x7BAF9A6A386B58113DB888298FFAA2C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
0x7B00978EDBBED639579F0F9C239C7905
was called Rochester?"
0xD07FC260E2353ED1D43900130904994C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
0x021560A9D342E1B571B9CD38116F8E17
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
0x385D00A3C9DDA903E63E29CA1A60ED67
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
0x86ED928B369BC688C1C91B0D654739ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
0x3A8A1D23987F6BEE42B9C9E25FFAD4B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
0xC7A29FD9AADFB75D98839F99EA104011
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
0xC4068292087E0BF600E617523E5FB8E5
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
0xB07A6B0A025C452D3BB81CF7F804BF32
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
0xC8B38AF984E7ED928CA4942922FDE2B9
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
0x48F6FE687D3B5FF0236659B705855B22
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
0x604E81531F3791D3A4FF2370B62B12F6
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
0x8F39711B937B058F850D86FE1970F9FB
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
0xF1397CD393D74E946BBE03500D0ECC46
expect nothing more."
0x00632B09EE188D61282A36BC4887D323

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
0x065927EB32D3F1A4A8A770E86C63706C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
0x48B52BD5ECE925B489AF6E8F6FFE4D97
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
0x239DB58419DF68C0A10B3D7B8185DDC0
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
0x1372DEAB5A7FDA8AE0ABFB849CE17C7D
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
0x34103ABE94EDD70EFD83ADF478CCCFF1
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
0xC15FBB79B250DCF9B57688519FA950A6
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
0x09AD3E507785849132246A1B03933D90
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
0x6B1F89A1BA79E8BB690F5A1B4F29F35D
the better--my position was all the freer.
0x8B19BDAA89070BB96B303D10336872FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
0x89623B0818F5D9114DD2A03E1E35ED2E
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
0x219936FA71F8EDD4AE4963E8E40E634A
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
0x25D833D6DD7BB0A29F1739392953181D
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
0xAAE31599149F91A17414D86D66298154
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
0x11FE762F6483306DACBC4683643CDD3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
0x36F857066CE11A7543D84B42A6ADA5C2
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
0xB09ECD66359C6B82AD4C2F817961144E
approached.
0xB565F17A86B30642DC30F06A936C7B9B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
0x657010C7E5FFA749C4EA60F7976A31F3
nurse; who answered--
0x834AF9667610ECD5B1AB7DD1C42497DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mais oui, certainement."
0x48D3509EFA2F52A4926A9B358A630282

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
0xA206860FF31551715A4161DD92157A51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
0x22E7E5C8FEFDD0B6A33C46EAF630478D
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
0xCA88595519C755CA880B8CB313117D8F
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
0x9BFAC4F7A8046B22DB6479AAD08D43C4
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
0xEBCEE5EC9AB12353CBBF186855240F9A
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
0xD50276BE29D130E6B32B1BCFD6BAF45F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
0x89167D28A47EFC17B39709CD947A5843
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
0x4BFCF5EE02AEB1692FD246036D13F308
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
0xE60A40A87490B58A6B7B61ECB1F80747
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
0xCA6F74C5D757FAC913BE08AF2574E029
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
0x38C8A677F8AC66036F7D1CFF426B0316
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
0x0D6880C45F1525294BFAB4CCD8F5D1A2
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
0x9BE2240760937746ADB5C95DFD6FB1AD
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
0x4A6400428BEC86B0D6E1ECC226A27C7E
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
0x8CBF992D0F4C9EC97CAA1BF2A4D1DCCF
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
0x11E56492FC844B1816A1B0389E14E445
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
0x72495064A76816E68A30517110D1EB4C
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
0x0350DDD3778E12B638C5D6A5655CA53B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
0x26CEDD3F78C6E92864A559F00DE6CE12
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
0xE9290EAB8AFC0632B39F86348D50BB03
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
0xE2D37CB603D58438452AE8B756147FCF
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
0x4F1E9FE233B2E5E9857818174DDC5DE8
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
0x15735C5B227E473E071218F6266BC03B
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
0x4E532A5105872F424DE5AF30DE6D5657
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
0x3523371A185BD40C413E13E0BC2F8506
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
0x1EEA1EE5AD80606724E60C37FEADA35A
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
0x3687EC2241A948DF2180A427A21568BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
0x90CB28ED7046E2B42E559D83FA4FAAF9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
0xCACA5DAE978E668A2C6F52FC2E530333
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
0x4011990742C316C8F7AF711EAFFC982F
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
0xEED0770590D9B955B09A30267A91DBB4
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
0xFD476D6138FAD0B4F7DE229AEB382E68
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
0x0E43E6FF833601B9013300764FBC65DE
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
0x654C61B3A8EC417E3B33306FEC93531B
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
0xC1064360BBB54EF600DEF427336A7008
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
0xEAC31BE6A180EE8FE8BC5B5B85E05D34
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
0x1FF7417CB5395E7EF72CDD074B81F3C1
fed with crumbs."
0x890D1989657BF7D306ECD6457D861D68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
0x78FC4CF377161B0D75679052AE0F305E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
0x5D2BB90A62A86FCF9366A8C21126A450
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
0x4D4D9839B17C306FCA6C8ABA289E39D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
0xA08785EC04543A44091E26F8BF035F92
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
0x1AF95E9A595C1C903D290E701D88FFCA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
0xC369327BC29C6FFAD3A970C3E98D8AB5
clean town you spoke of?"
0xEF31FEC1E6545E415D785D8A0AE50940

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
0xA3630525B8BEF16E0B39CF05319B9501
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
0xD5DCA6C43634406231527DCDBB4CB29B
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
0x06183165EEDAFCCF112CFFA7CCECDD60
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
0xD287CC41742CA0F45247E420257C052D
hear me sing now?"
0x89CCCC425D8938113630112175DE7AC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
0x6BF4E013A74A55674970DCAFD75034EF
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
0x0C1D24F183AFC7086142179956D0E00B
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
0x94484D98521FFB0FF2420CDC5A7B66A5
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
0x275DD449954444570E48599B7575F9B7
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
0xC4C4FF1A4C5AA5B5ADA169CA2FE6E8CB
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
0x3FCB6B8A839D1675CD876B56DD5012F8
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
0xD55E1172C1C26B1D5247300833ECA892
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
0xD82D012C35D346FED183E6C32BBC5947
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
0xFEC48EE50E291F57E20977F862439278
affected her.
0xC6DE66F84B05C7DBDE4F36AB93053D30

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
0xAA0D721DB32A072FA4E2A0E0F15E79F7
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
0x1860DE62EAF386185C1D24B7B5CB1EA9
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
0x7DB83E43643F15CB4E453D980286078C
at least I thought so.
0xE29B81114142ED6297388B30CF2BBC04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
0x3BF23E3DAAC43908B4236FB2C3CFD08F
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
0x24D9E70A871A37FB30D4C3A79C3ABE16
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
0xC68B6F9F247CB5862AC6B1756F1E94C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
0xE482BBC7CFF03A4C2FCD3A583C5DC9D1
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
0x21B05F1BC1A06FF8CCD343B7D9C94315
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
0x6B60E5D58DDEE824693B653CAD92BCB0
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
0xA73E5A5E62B22B6EA79160A1ADDA30C8
carefully trained.
0x46D72DE6AA7ED1C48888CFF19DDCC6C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
0x534CD09263ED16B4540AF0142E93D464

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
0xF420D1208445D142A9035D211E2D1F28
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
0xB1EA394F8F1E28F1178ED8A7A79A79EB
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
0xDF8F6C6EA8C191F0EDFD726CD000E68F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
0xE8BAEFD26B62ADCD75CAD0107B4156CE
say, with whom did you live then?"
0x6D91B3C45258BC6394D6B2BAA3063E61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
0xA6F79AF69A0CD0609A416C364BDE999F
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
0x71B00B14B2B9881244B515805E4B21D4
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
0x53F1D04EDB62AFF0AF629F5E1E3260AD
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
0xB6CB939C6FB6BC2EC3B832FD3B72AF61
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
0xE24735B3AF3ACA1C9CBCF9E4D9544D83
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
0xB41F7AE16A130E9556A7C0E91E4FEF55
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
0xEC29464F19F79C16DA2255AD7E888075
and I never see him."
0xC68E9F13BA7452407BE9B41F9C6C01A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
0x2D5A93602C29E0A5CC823464AAF3E691
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
0x673360FC5B6F41F06C4AEC5241491A9C
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
0x413F211DFE7127C44262175C8C6E6573
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
0x3B4883E4B68496B73E5B99BC364DC927
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
0xFD14B97D451C864F29139279817BACC6
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
0x7567289582FA7676B53608EC6F87E5F2
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
0x1D945EB8C4A595069DD4B24CD42EFC83
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
0x1DB69B28032387B0EA8C30F2C14F36C9
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
0x1F30E1C49B97C611F507C570335AD4D5
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
0xF229110B38BDC77ACA6B5A4820348823
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
0xD57D71657CDAA5F269EEAE13A36FBF27
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
0xF4A7EFB232CAA384958096226A84B7AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
0xB9025B2AAC8E078D1563A6B563B8FEC6
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
0x0018F96CC45EEA29B2D45870EFEE44EC
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
0x68CD6E589EA7B86C40E99984CE90DE80
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
0x0283F2308073280B1A106C694F09D50F
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
0x30133EA4A079C556F1FB768E63F7AB93
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
0x962731A5F28BBAF3EF3EB6D7221BC31F
use.
0x8C018F118C018F1145B66BE93DE1D8FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
0xE0C96627F5A976DED96C081AD3509C40
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
0xD6672C7631A47E7E121CF47385FD7AB8
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
0x004DCE6BDCD66BC645AA12A15872452F
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
0xF8DCDDD9764FDEC1B089DB20FAB86BAA
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
0x1F601337227AD5DB907D49C99DC41495
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
0x46A7855332A8BD125EC6ADF96DE0BA9B
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
0xED0887609E952701A7C6696703277FBD
sideboard.
0xF8BA4C2689E8E4799AF101C4F7E98008

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
0x44DB9E2AA37886EE5A6B58BBDF8C5BF8
before seen any half so imposing.
0x452A513281821644FE856BE2A9C348B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
0xD29478C3C3A0644C65A9B691EF259166
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
0x055DDFD137A0783985660CCF286CFFA1
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
0x1DDFC138AD349209C6A3C522470C369C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
0x4FDC2C06D8CE6A2E7BECF52EAC9DC3D8
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
0x3FF82C92BFCEB8C8305D738E7032B916
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
0xD3AB47D7A5C70D15C33D488015FFF92F
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
0x944671418D5A0E958135F6C2059B69F9
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
0x2421E32DF226199A5A5B538E61AB4A30
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
0x2DAE3831311A64B4C19F3961EE550D2C
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
0x9C5112EE64D5ED25E2DF4C313796DB6F
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
0xBA502D9C6D1016BDAEFAE2CA79372F07
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
0x5C894DC4732622CA33E50757EB31F019
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
0xE505954745E85395D07A362A857BAE53
general blending of snow and fire.
0x32EFB2AF69673A884C84768D4CECBB15

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
0xC795AC4418E31F5D1423A689A40A67DE
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
0xA961B2EDEDE74E3848E46D0B62AFCF39
were inhabited daily."
0x45B5A9C69FB5F190644941CD75CE47C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
0x2F1DC563FDE5754407F709A9976308C5
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
0x0F1AB172E764CD3EAD2581AA7C9D8276
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
0x410A85C4C4A262B24E56B0551CAE2BA2
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
0x934B6986F88C71794CA71FDC0E41028C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
0x010AC369B106B4E570BED78586948AE3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
0x39C75AB1DE446AC6399B33C551B99BE4
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
0x7FEE84D04B0217615C7C1C8FEA6CEF72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
0xC94A3549F40CB7AA0C8D32309F14D898

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
0xB636B5531FA5092FF4D5A498930FB07A
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
0xE03D37E5B1EBDA0BDE3703A6641ABCD4
Rochesters time out of mind."
0x2492FF5CDB5C1E13850FFF465AB28521

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
0x60E11B60C33AC7A6F0C0A752C2BBCAC6
liked for himself?"
0xFDE345042209B90019E37D5047BD8446

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
0x9DE361ED08E1CEFEE149049F6AE8D0F3
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
0xFD0CBFD9C59B1D596A467B658D0A24BE
lived much amongst them."
0x46A3D29F16A18A8C49A4FEB1F0B74584

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
0x2CCC32E08AE7F0C3058AB3BE5223F8D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
0x1F4C7A866F247DECBF07ABD8169D75DB
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
0x7CED7D6E880C480846A3E7A183425483
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
0x0DDB05F0683B0F234ECE93283DC6CCE8
conversation with him."
0x2D66EDDC4D60621FE549F6BE207B58A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In what way is he peculiar?"
0x80777650DE13633E338AF8ACC615C7BE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
0xCC7738ACDA66663C853B9A6EF49CFA6F
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
0xB6B70194611916CC4B176EEAF9677DFE
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
0x2DE9686EE8812DC3F66D2C3BD5192186
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
0x14B4A2AE8EF97B5C487007A96EAE61C6
he is a very good master."
0xCD55799C1752E3D9257CDF7661807522

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
0x9C90D5FC056D3540D680835D4F7B41AD
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
0x76AE365EDED0270A8439ADEE714E820A
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
0xB81E4D8FDCEC6AB3257DC3D34D22271A
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
0xDD9F56FA9613631AE87023CB188279B9
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
0x7C3464352B67E5EAFD94452F5726F452
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
0xBA989AC52EBFEBF017A1A430007A40D5
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
0x0C0E7F332FD1DC03F4A18F277D561D5B
definite notion of his identity.
0xA58AE2D8A6C223CE43EECE99A39D6A8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
0xD317FDB35433BE84411CB3364FEFA2E0
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
0x4254B80CA5628A7E844290249175BA46
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
0xE67CBDBC3E5AAFD3C7F4C9F22EDBD8D3
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
0x35E062D596063F16C6FE5C5C9676610D
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
0xCA8561F241D7870573EC9E4F9B9372B2
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
0xB4A93BC2832A11E4C972D4E44C64446A
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
0x7B4185EC4BD388DCE57F19BB0E759B1B
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
0x58F64E05A94BC85E6BF32A446D82D13C
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
0xE43FA5D698E85FB3E32993CD49A8202B
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
0x375596422BF072B6F999935D81C32433
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
0xB13806E13018971A06B9EE66634E30DC
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
0x5F0BE775B4D9725544C8EA4DDBDB882F
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
0x54418A06809E1BA0ED96699EDE91FE54
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
0xDCF4AE08B43DE48D2D8F14896B16A66D
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
0xDC29BD61E0DDF34927CD2D2A43D20C5F
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
0x0C59CC5DF76EAC56188C9CE3AC259EA1
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
0x054552DD46A2C9B1333EDE7C2097F5D4
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
0x7B17EE3126D70D8422603C6D34CA7FB1
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
0x4FDCC9A619F6BB2118AEB09B7A46F97E
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
0x838ECB6576E44529684630031A12DBAC
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
0x038A3DC9EC98EB5769B546CE52E88518

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
0x64ED3EFFBC1FFE97BCB196C194BA32FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
0x265280EEDAD64329470CC93E3AADC903
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
0x77C0ECA3581F03B66D40BE09FDDC1FA7
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
0x585738191F3A8CF3A9837440E0508851

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
0x4B2E7259FE9196001825B4CF6E75DE42

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
0x3AF33841CA132C6F3AD893D03A1718E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
0x0F84C5789463A4DD87824FCF3C75EB86

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
0x6C3DAE5D3AFB8FFA8560811AC182A256
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
0xC4134285F8F0BEAF245DC319E4168BF7
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
0x207D7A78E9ABCA5ACB45807D4726C387

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
0xEEE3EA450C8F504A0674542B710572E8
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
0xA73C90A2330AC2DA90C8ED61939645BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
0x3F355660B63BBE95626A86F55854D5AB
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
0x4B3E3D4462BCB10CEFDAEB834AB704D4
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
0xF01893751A34F0C5224F83110944ECA9
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
0x0F0854AE3221671F855171EB14A5BCCF
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
0x3324355915A748D6D7CE06FC8F8F53FB
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
0xB54CC9E1C460C7797AF129C1E84C620E
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
0xCE015EC1A1BC9D9BD70C56E6B978CFC4
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
0xB9F326774F9E8EDFADD78AFC8C499B76
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
0xF049837D5FFECF7F4E8BEC533F2CBE44
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
0x21FF25D95CACCBB41EF1D31798766575
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
0x59B399D0D16CA1DA4EF8F9BDA251337E
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
0xCAFC0EA5C0415D0FC30B5EABCBBAF06A
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
0x9880C57E14898E2F6C8D8D43D66E4D29
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
0x6FF091905CCB1D9A919A2A3FA1418769
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
0x990DF38C27272122EC74A7A93438CA18
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
0xC0BA7E037C4298491113A02EF5344320
over which I had been gazing with delight.
0x2F921504987B685AF0BD30A7482E4FC2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
0x2168C1C739201FA570830CC000586FA2
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
0x34D44DD7B9800DA3F0BBFBFD11D009B5
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
0x557B8244715095BE8E174A73AAB59D51
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
0x295D4A01F590954949FD69ACC5F17909
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
0xC464841932A5A1256AEAD9C08D8E4818
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
0x16BF77895CD88CC546B2DA5562CDC136
Bluebeard's castle.
0x8710F3C693DF8D92485A2BACCE5F5755

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
0x46BC9CC332171BEAB9F750A9F68458D5
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
0xC590410835FF2E9CC776A613E3FA6B08
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
0x0A5BA592A4A8569C5B38F23CA8BB1D50
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
0x892CEEAA84804ECE522F9A0831C979F6
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
0x4A8F2AD38E61D95F16083A84B50353E4
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
0x3E1316912043D4AAEFB7E2C33C2E8C5D
out the door whence the accents issued.
0x405082960D839F5D391C58C8AE26DE05

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
0x0FE2B5BEC540E98FB1863C82D62058C9
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
0x033D6A65BCACCDED44C1F77CB71AE059

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
0xF09E44DC2815496424964ABADD384D1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
0x15AC6671CBFFC7A011544040ACAA0CBD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
0xB6E5EA44A145F8B2AD1D81E04BE189A7
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
0x9D50C5218800A3C4807BEA731B48E0E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
0x9A2427A30C67B086F9ADB4DAF6D103EA
odd murmur.
0xA9EE4AFA12A4B0647A4EA1179038662C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
0xEF1F87FADCF87CB03A1B5C345D2ED5B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
0xC0D1B102C932B1DB5FC659E352F3EBB7
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
0xB260618AFD70A34698F5752ED4608731
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
0x9BAB2D33FCBCD50595CA4F3114FC2434
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
0xC651E1ACC443A583AE845587C87EF5EB
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
0xBF2E378422118D8D882D0CFF7EA61C9E
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
0x756B149B32F534D87AB8AC50F10C798D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
0x9BF49126C31DEF184200F5228DC5FB54
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
0x4807BB6D87DD4930F8862E8F91338992
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
0x5C023D4A65A3D3844E52CB3FDEA9733B
be conceived.
0x8058B9B88F5DC576904B61931D72F52F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
0xFB3249A2F62C4115663A6D13EC2991CB
curtseyed silently and went in.
0xB82C3409CC90ADC1E974967FD4A9A12F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
0x540658DEE8CB5F38F1070801F58C29E5
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
0xA35E0B1F24E7EBF3BEFC02F9874B7B7D
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
0xC6D77CB6E00136D575E0D550630EE613
pupil this morning?"
0xC08CAD9F5CFC6744F61112E450AF9E56

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
0xDB7DA36B6F54B0ACC2549BC71960A6D2
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
0xE2F41AD551882C0FE5D56B6544711BA4
hall, exclaiming--
0x77FB35BCEF4D60F116487B8CD35CB324

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
0xF149876EE062E23DCAAF6F75D532E06F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
0xA719E1045AD3C34405ADC88BE283813F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
0x211F603BBC4C60F4515ADDCF95FF8817
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
0x5832FFBE2E487D31D9FEE6D32890F45A
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
0x8653CB826566641E216C5A8A175C07EA
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
0xEAC23BC05921C0408C9D17ACB7085F29
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
0xF1ED45905F748BB2494503E348D2BB30
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
0x06920365EC8ED11E5B9A6AE973162BE0
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
0x97A244236F79A9D81DC9CC36198843BF
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
0x493D9C8B55CF1F9C93E7B70E6BB23778
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
0x621FDF79984F72B2A0C8BEA3FC58EF80
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
0x221D1648745EB8024B6FC97AA811322B
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
0xF115F45EDEFBA3F7C4DAE2A20CB5AB17
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
0x2693F4ADCDFFD948CE6A00F805DB48B7
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
0x1E3BD0C96B61EE994F2A913F8933730C
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
0x89033B35AF2CB708CFDCB765D444C4CC
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
0x4C76478E6C385CDEB727F79BE7EAB981
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
0x8C56AE2BB47CDDBED517B010E53E511D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
0x018902C683A70F21643D1F04B5205E76
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
0x8736279C429C89801170379FBEF0657C
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
0x965A80144B977C0E6969D31ADD56D884
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
0x975CC769658E58D26A03C84E957A0577
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
0x48E2E2A1F94E1F980EEA6C5E042D2076
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
0xDA073A450D0E8AD5345A3C3DBD93A56D
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
0xEC387DE91369FAE053779FF4021E0DCD
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
0x4FF78C87000B323A487DB1BA124BCA02
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
0x2B7825BB861D2D8A17E279228CC1B4FA
of her mind and character.
0x3383550B2A8245066DCB3FFF7AA29749

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
0xCC6F9E4FE0A6A843E41A3DE236C081E6
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
0x3903C93AF91439D45064D24CCA9B8539
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
0x1065404D2A3EC00F953F08F5A6C114DD
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
0xCD3A25495C4087C65E7376B0297906A1
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
0xC960509D6068C7A50DE2AE1A5EAA2BD1
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
0x64CAB390EB10C15DA5B4DDC0E339A130
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
0x8A12CEF811F02C3C73E6796219B2760F
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
0x8D7B2AE5CD65ED3C6130C45F110650C0
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
0x3B81DBD5BAC1886C3491CA722A76D145
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
0xE71ABDE286603609F5C590EDA6E995EF
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
0x80A2176DEE737F2882BB4907769D922F
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
0x3781DC8AD8000F0AF7D1AD4226642A49
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
0xE6B5EF425020F175FE0A3A15486C99B7
what I believed in I wished to behold.
0xD0085A4C9ED53D05ADE1443247471C5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
0xB411D394874EDAB081572AF3DB8DED36
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
0xBC36644AA7A402A8A6B58BDB0E7A030C
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
0xD55ED7B71EC44D4B5DBCD3598A11068F
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
0x4B0CCFF46661907FB5D4EE01F7147461
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
0x84E0AB6E7EEC2F8170AC2380A2C0B4C3
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
0x9512D30F940D2620A11E4B62E3E16D13
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
0x0403FE9E612005484EF0EF10CDA51D5A
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
0x3F8F46F156F9EEC8D2C0582A43F73A5C
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
0x630E1BF5B42ACF77A9292BF9BA145908
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
0x7B6F473CD4A9D5328FD06F8170831219
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
0x4B5C93F03E35F43885A5A1B63CF32854

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
0x46861C3AA87F245FBABCEAFC56FE89C8
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
0x529D530C79A97DAD56636955857D751E
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
0x1BFD1191B263C51AD0C7B5ED043D6DD9
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
0xFFC33FBCCE3A6874A778EC38BC2D57F9
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
0xDD95B55297AB11955B7663ECCFA8F638
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
0x4AF14BB18DE47B392B44DD2CD085C6D3
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
0x16941320E0F4F2EE9601ECC00BA63067
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
0x364054EB07099ECA547203138B8ECF5E
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
0xB7CCC66DF90A92CEBD1DAAB9CAFF3816
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
0x6DF4C99C34EC7276844AC7AA4752C01F
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
0x98310CFC101E03D1A86E1551A6BDEEDA
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
0x59ABDF64F24AFEA1F289E39B2695B1E5
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
0x9FDB8137953AAC7BCD15B81DAF1397E4
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
0xE53AEC0C94209AC5DBD47A5AA722E03B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
0x977EC6802C716BF7573F2D9B043A5EA5
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
0x641694C8E837A29E42F3E058E27FA2E9
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
0x0AD298B61DC56A6F91B1BE615770B193
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
0x85BFAD544704F609CF488B50C0065286
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
0xF1E63DBA44111CBB499363DC1C2A0C6F
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
0x910AB3C5C513456DF6F0F626C521C2BA
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,

forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
0x83A72A975EBA6C2807966C944BEDED8B
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
0x5CDEFB524E229B726D5F26DA1D7C6AC3
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
0x76D0745C482B4021A6FD673EE5AB7C69
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
0xCE702902153DB0783EF288BE0E906F06
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
0xD469D72C306A0E59C0096536BE3B6E3A
every effort of that sort.

The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
0x5A008E9114E585D06E23D5AF2BD678AA
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
0x73D3840CF44BAB8916B7E03C8180CD0A
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
0x2BF8A29A8350AF69E14027353ECA2472
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
0x465F6B9EC91DA10D204D08AB5FE4AB4D
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
0xEF739A2E549E3130E091E1B4B91C5E84
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.

October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
0x09AE1EF31D8957C3621E85EB07849745
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
0x323C9C802977A0F0CF478935EF8A00AD
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
0xF5A15A3196F11B956949C445BA436E82
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
0xE63F916DE0BB7479987BD3C01974E78A
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
0xF97F688E22AE824DBA1F3810EADB7FD1
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
0xA6FD16865B408EA1E01F9FB9C90B26CC
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
0x968B8D60CC793C82B6FB991B04B38AC8
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
0x4BBEC4C44998986A447CE91115ECC9E9
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
0x12D13266034E4CC05033391087D6E4CF
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
0xC8EAC0DE8B9C02C6BDFE7EBC5E07E255
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
0xAFF58F1FDBAD662BDC3DEE7EBEEC0F34
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
0xD40AA2ED45634E9F4B1F8413C4B6115F
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
0xB9C8B43CCFA0BB5FF2B891B3F63CFE22
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
0xA6F362D039D2080DD209F840967A4134
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
0x855853F916122DCA635DCBE660D4D755

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
0x6BBD6C4263438319F26D51BB0A935FFE
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
0xC9DE6B18C10D8B0C11BE486448692B71
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
0x0C01E1509D55428DF4378056E94F6197
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
0x2209A4DAC36DDF6A5132487638A224EE
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
0x3DE4930EFA819E2829B81F4A2A29D59E
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
0x6720F3A9049AB1D8A5EA3CE599B72020
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
0xB97E7C3967A89EA20E4E5C0656532838
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
0x4C0E8F4C2819D4A3FC4C37E6449013FB
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
0x85F07ACD3BB3F7181E568EA2ED50DAC2
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
0xBD1F433E74BD28A687D44BFFEB017330
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
0xF2747BA056828E48C588FFF7645DFE63
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
0xACFDF647B1238F1FC6F3597FDAFD1726
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
0x02B2852E86020689DD48C1E5AB937196
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
0x3483E47AF5317B8201C5D0CD4D59AAFB
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
0x8CF23EF420181F0D28DA42C439789164

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
0x902D3336059053AF26FF6EC6564AF88B
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
0xB4809864E39C3A7FB378523A926038BD
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
0xB23AB12FF1697BCE112729C79231CE43
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
0x2C93E8C0C38A77B083348F65F8C4E464
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
0x6F2744DC07C3A7BD2FEDBA3BEC186632
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
0x3629AEF67BFEEF1D5B96C0D0C232C61B
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
0xD9662B1048DB46BE4B7E2A2AC509808A
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
0x92C962F36B6F88C874BE574EB792C971
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
0x274EE6DEE30D5E69B37A1D90B8188206
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
0x27CC0E43DFF6EAC9F136506969DCC676

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
0xF0FF635863A4B223CFE8AB7B12A32203
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
0x49214D0C96E9EC3B0E9C24DF8E12D015
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
0x8FC9FB7FF60C14E0F46E11952E47A968
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
0xC61FF763FD7FDAD7346FA71E454FA28A
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
0xFA42FC9CCB431C9B392635E40086D374
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
0x305A2B94BE5A7B79365791FDDB30A4FB
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
0xFDAD28E8225A01616A1651A4CB7597C6
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
0xAB598C0398B12F6E1CF2F186CEDA215B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
0xBC5D5169751818A38042EC9E4FC9D1C5
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
0x40207AF1D116CCB43277570F72E2013E
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
0x9384CC757A4362999411E6608F0CF09B
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
0x3D4BF628267EFA5668AB43AFBA8295A8
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
0xC45D73FE292ED465107E60AFE9C52C4D
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
0x5D1203E0B1C5AA4BCDD44E7D0172CF1A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
0x1A9EA00AE210E5F7F3DEC23E9A5ED983
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
0xF161FD8ACECBA10C06FFE33E526493B2
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
0x371CF9825485FAF4B1A06886CB2A71FA
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
0x35E30AFECA62B395F160265394F0355F
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
0x3A6DAFC33ACB89A685425D1167F6381D
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
0xC1ABB1D266D2EBA3B87F017E48FA322A
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
0xCDBBC4DC431FE420F5695BC1DD47A113
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
0x7DFD6CBECCDBECABD1AC562A1651C0DF
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
0x673BA88DE18E469278B5DBD505921738
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
0xD8065B12ED13C2EE56AC940E2EEDEB7D
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
0x7D90F87F7B82D39906F75F54AB3191DC
me.
0x4E106EDF4E106EDF4E106EDFFCA050BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
0x79168FE43F2B14EA0CD769E5CB375B90
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
0x2D7C24897733CED6A2190FC4C07A120F
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
0xA6FAB4FB9FC72E3B77C4074498882B3E
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
0xE4CD3B24929AA1922EB73FD659B0152F
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
0xA8D27C1A4CE63A135B15886337B75A2B
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
0x4C6F2DD064A67F8606F7AAF9A0DAA303
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
0xE00F9B62C96309BCCD285BC34758F463
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
0x3527AC99003A35A2BF30DACB781E8F4A
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
0xDA48B2B5EE8F0C97EB605B279E4C6D8A
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
0x1CA70042179BB817B489EAF07AFA690B
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
0x9753B057858A088C34FA67AE31794062
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
0x3AF96B06814A0CED29AB23D42A0595F8
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
0x036A3A2907599E0D0819488D5D91AE86
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
0x4691DB0D2A41A4D279E16A88A4951F6F
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
0xAE4D2C1F18452658FC5BC7943A12E6AA
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
0xAD7D5E7840DA0A819B31C06BBC8CCD84
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
0xC8F1090A6D5B1B27D847CC5538D867E8
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
0x0DBFF40B794717688B6DB29757C1CCB1
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
0xC694BE18DF74123297EF17E2420739D0
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
0x12EBF2BBBA900D2B5703F87B15A0FF5B
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
0x779BE98332126F9F30136F81FDC4BC89
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
0x78194B861AD5AA81F4887C68A82FC779
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
0x20629AFA8C9908EA3B0674CBCC456212

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you injured, sir?"
0xC7F450A91543DCE7A9A3253F1D277E8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
0x6B2FABC64BF0E0206F48C0BF280CC148
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
0x4642A005993B5CD673714BB7F93911C4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
0xEF51EF9689337B17ECC354B8DD00560E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
0x5086602ADD2DF293A2B061912E3E5476
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
0xA7579D26BF493C23096D6B7FC8E56938
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
0x3236241C5563D388F7131285CD3A3B7C
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
0x2B839E31666937AC56085CD5AC03863E
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
0xCA5C36429BD4598F4A375E09BAC46285
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
0x79C37C49CAD3B2656091048D08EAB78D
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
0x2D0DA65AC83CBD878D81012BCA82F00A
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
0xCD000FAFE17D3115D66A8762A5B69604
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
0xDB3FB9DDFE687AF519FABDC67D1B3943

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
0x1C37244661A1CCEBA76C88D5ACDDBF9B
now drew near him again.
0xA3455CFFB21AA8FD13FF052B4B65461A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
0xA6B0A42F58EABB6C68634AD03177B09B
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
0x697173104A7A7E5410CD91DBAF0B5D59

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
0xABADF7897CB659CB5B9781ECA85BAC3C
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
0x0570278681FD65D6D6AF87EF4626C2FA
involuntary "Ugh!"
0xC0468E362C5B0515B80E5D1F634015C8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
0x8562B2B6ABE5BECA52EC827C362EBA94
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
0xF0838C5B1DDBC4ECBE62441737453F14
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
0xE07CF215BFD85BDC0D6294C2E5940BDF
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
0x8C8194B5A113F386B1C98AE4F7D47716
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
0x0D8446302298607F2E2B5C2C4438B51B
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
0x42D99BDF452D389EDBC0728B361A2A9C
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
0x971719C5DD87D2282EE1776CC7445B91
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
0x03685F2BCE2C5BC09B41E8DD951D1460
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
0xB24B213BC893BD7A51F6F13A31F81EDE
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
0x805391DC68491373FF77C37D9B255894
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
0xA68D97D87C1B17828E47B12832E39444
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
0x5F6A3E68B64DF051AC2E2B99B1C1734D
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
0x987A1D3E3EFE7E071C0237ECF7F6610B
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
0x14E035E36220FDCD6F6B540355BF6DC4
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
0x685C4C4A4D04657C0FAB1D138356112B
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
0x63C5D5F43995CA07D2B669ACE3F0A1CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
0x7BB31FD596DDEA14CB3736FA9A4A0BF6
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
0xA425C66C226DAFF73AA94E823D1B63F5
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
0x60503CC3951F96B0E747537AFDE0C600
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
0x7A660B4B1E131662942EE827455FFC6F
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
0x8CF1E9B6AD539B0CC88248072C78B2FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
0xF9139106AD060FBCDA16025278672DE4
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
0xA33A587D890281AE5F75C518AC9371AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
0x73CB7AB792230D17E64B34A726E7F53D
direction before.
0x59323A2FF8A658E5248B4A335CC6637E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have

"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"

pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
0x610DC422DE0B9A63788FF4989745A462
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
0x42BE78AC127EE12CCD3C67C99C7A1ED9
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.

"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
0x86C0B8A566D934B1C713CCC98908BCA1
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
0x131560275985C49D7ACDACF654C0071C
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
0x4E202BB112F6391208D50DA8E3BDA03B
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.

"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
0xF554D03CF7EB731ACE55B318397FC63D
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
0x6B4F194D2E02E6797AC97C120CA847E1
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.

0x10D926B13D902AFA680A5FE1B5061D5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
0x178D1F3D6DDB675C4F4CC083DC26FAE5
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
0x9236B1C11CD0411D03E189A63F9C840A
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
0xBB0B5070C8D90156A6C258C83065D427
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
0x36B835B3F06F4AAC18CFCDCAD93CC8AE
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
0x7EF2341017EBA02FCE669C1160631353
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
0xDA0CED7B1D64A7BE5D0FC11EE913CC30
he laughed.

"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
0xDBB7380417747264B62B321BFAC4EC32
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
0xC7A080C793E19A01E93D811457A3E707
come here."
0x9A94FB8706165425F30A73575A3A0A7D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
0xD726E64423AF6BAEA2BDF79BDF5B345C
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
0xB6E8B9C021EB934B69470A547FF56D17
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
0xE86D365FEED2D4A109E325AE491493E9
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
0xB28604F1BF3BA0684BC730DB39A59BD2
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
0x5FC476A81680331DE4679F4718952E01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
0x1A66E3A2BB1B6090E15D1998AC8576E8
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
0x97C8FEF773839B7785E7560AC805B687

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I sought it and found it.
0x6D86B6BD14BC9E8FBD297B1F4C80DB05

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
0xAB3CAFC55D4891F137C98747BF63C497
you can."
0x927BC32511A4CE8B50BBE15BD24CDB94

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
0x3333F6A6FBED6DDFF526DCBB57C6176B
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
0xA1D47AC2FEC8E81E945E065B152BD944

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
0xA196C14675C5E7ABCDAD9B124C870C1A
   The wild wind whirls away."
0xFBA024F4D3B85E5D95DE48EC3F629884

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
0xEC636CF7713F7C0C2F5112E7AB5D7B56
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
0x205C044239072BA0F899D3DBF7004DE6
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
0x0A213995D641F3612B420D8C3BF2C41B
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
0xC9F5A2E9BFD5F6AAEDEB2E6E85F93A7C
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
0x494CE9792C180A946D009DE215CFF8BA
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
0x98F441741E96F20C05689A9726B1E882
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
0xF00A37DE2F3D338D44684BB993324091
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
0x66D3D20EA61BCF3637BA88C15170E229
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
0x4124D270E9276715A7DA7FC279183CCE
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
0x82C047F0FFAE61BE8B3906B685EAA865
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
0xA5D323A4C305DBFC3F6081B6D27E1C26
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
0xA7CF29891B5B4CA5ED42480869C0227A
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
0x0CF16CC198225B35E3CB01F7D81B9316
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
0x7C592693BF96C66B787F461D093ECACB
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
0xD8A67F9E4E05CD581395CDA742516CB6
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
0x2D4FC670788B38E563B23C683E117992
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
0x0ADBE5D6AEE026EF431CFC98317F66D6
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
0xFA9CE1320592D89C920C96F47AAA25DE
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
0x9112DA935DAD88790F9F6ECE93E1B525
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
0x9FF34521DD68D4CD26BF33B8F5E146DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
0x315DB1380C5F961C9FF75D026133109A
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
0x260F0310D0B5978B43354FC3650C979A
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
0xAC089B4232CF7B977A9EE57A79F04200
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
0xCA972B5858BBD02C5517B0FA67A55FE2
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
0x7E5706DC3146F1DF2BC61BEB3A28B9BE
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
0x74D26EAA856C4AC6C3BFA8449C84772E
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
0x6B35E08DA5169298D049919B0E7D76D3
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
0xF846EC9A062DB209AA1CD19BF878825E
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
0x484A73E794D158C23762665B13D96DEB
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
0x5E6D7D751B23F077003B86D3B364101B
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
0x7BA06D5BE973F3ED53BEEA50D49C333D
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
0x15FF1DB16221A4FC7EC9014ED960231A
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
0x84DCFE5225485BF03B9180DA5201BB15
as it would be under his.
0x6304F803EFF099A858486F020196D477

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
0xCF21E33DA2141886B7D18CB20EBFDADB
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
0x2429DF8AB009AD057F46D8B5ED7F9BC9
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
0x8E63E7D8CEE4FFB3FE228B17539834FF
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
0x3660B0C1BE953C4E7EB4DBB04BFAA1F5
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
0x3B5B6F9DF8BCF79FC3C7A1570C276165
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
0x909504D2BB1857D40B5EBDC7934094F1
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
0x9C5349410BF595011ED13697B1E238A7
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
0xFE7758728AB86AFEB5E8124250D83D19
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
0xD91A5FC94A6F4C05E682478FC7744071
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
0xE16F2F9FC44F8326CE86F07EB432DF99
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
0xBD0BFF462DF769C869CD160BEEEB9D78
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
0xCA57FEEE633CDD53DDFDD66220CD1196
door, and went in.
0x52DE2DE91E9CE40491A1082BFE6146BE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
0x52BC94F986C1201441B150D0CDD32176
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
0x007A61ECC498DC57CE576DDC56EC9346
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
0x4895C616F0E7614C3B8E4C6BC479D9D8
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
0xADD41648225106F0AA33FA2E0D74CB66
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
0xCAC9A4B2F2EDAFCA14FB05673556D303
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
0xDE376AF9FB9069CFE183516FF8D81C4D
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
0x0C5985088E8BEDFFBF200CE0B50B9E4E
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
0x73709870635664FDD5BD4CE9CEE94946
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
0x60785BDA0328B415B223186800ABCB15

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
0x71F5CA5D4D2C2A7F8A3F5155B50AD13F
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
0x6858871AFBB70A0303C5C275CCF01BB7
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
0xCC5D72F86C95314EBD51D19F22E6627A
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
0x8048C19943F8BA529C82FD961C295356
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
0x8D5C479C3744B41AD09A7E4A2C393A3D
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
0x427567843C24CB5272E4C9C7F90D7FF7
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
0x166991BE2FC3AF523F5A89A922D3A2A3
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
0x85D1EC20CD9D3D697FF81F70E0BB0D2E
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
0x046BF98D646167606BA1BDE385CF04CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What dog is this?"
0x6BCF265FBFF421275B8A4E8A5609EB8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
0xA3837B146E56FA107130CBB1E90E590A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
0xFA03F8D191BA6EC7BBE5733F280551CA
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
0x578B1C9E8A864B7FAD8025EFAC508FA3
sprained."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the

news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
0x039CF3A6CF5D4E0919167AD031360E4E
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
0x98D9E2B8121CEF94835D99317D6BFEC6
upstairs to take off my things.

CHAPTER XIII

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
0xA4F13428649EB8493EB03D052D56117E
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
0x86EE55DFF0CBEB288BCD6D85D02D7352
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
0x1CAE725ABC476E1E7F9BCC7DE208B47C
and waiting to speak with him.
0xDE80041C43BA0F6308CC8750BD7A7ADA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
0x949D7DD7988F0EA3CA7287FB3DA543A4
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
0x562791E3B35997AB6DBE9F379E326FB3
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
0x7056CB926FB53AC9FCDF975A03336B42
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
0x9D7E0B530BD487544380B5EE116F6C0F
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
0x539533C07A091B49C0979DF1607E8A44
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
0x3111005002CF697B26315D1E05467EE5
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
0x62620EECB0AA0FCA0B928225E609314F
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
0x8C17F7723C6AFFE3EED4D1B2D7D19B82
master: for my part, I liked it better.
0xFEF1718C0377C6A7D13C4544420F1399

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
0xF0286ABF5C9226BA55293766C9EFEE33
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
0xBF47A45589E34EE29FF22950249B53C7
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
0x91561FBB04B9D45CFAFC539B9EE1D392
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
0x34102853545C0C3B88915F5AF30FD90B
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
0xAA2E9965E838A079F31046C4D4402F62
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
0x9D616C3F75085A1D5F570BB0DA576354
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
0x5BB574E410BF83FA1AA4B113EEB9355C
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
0x9FA3C3631ACA28793CDC0FB599027CC9
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
0x75784EB2DF99E84409AE7309A751E0DF
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
0x07151201E7846102DDBE72E180A1A3A5
box in whose contents she had an interest.
0x878F2460DC9468B2A3DFB2228CB88634

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
0x13A15F45BF516F1F358A2CDA13F26364
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
0x746AC30038ADDEC74799A8E7AFE62C49
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
0x4F6E8435E0B6150068829396079BAF77
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
0xD77B79BE505B6AC117262D888D6ACEF4
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
0x0463D95D8C78884718CAEE3568B4A633

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
0xF1D3CD0745E405E952729E91D23B86DF
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
0x21FEED864CC9484E923A25A056FB5778
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
0x7F97C21AAC53C68BB9864873BD97CFCB
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
0x111F1377EC1B97039CA916E479DD8780
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
0x54FEFD40F01A1B9D305F055A4E97D7A1
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
0x795AA3393895D365EC9F3CAC68802F4C
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
0xF6DF653B007AF199ED6F14C6DC9C1422
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
0x3AE642D084C4EAA5B8FE56EA8155668E
fireside.
0xD1793F9B70881F0EA5CDE26CBC291A09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
0xD6BE69714AA2413B04E7B733F6A055D3
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
0x23FD04DD9A5588DAEE099F9849A29D9A
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
0x3647631474339A1167FEA84840FCDAEC
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
0x06A2B96BDD91BAC22E065BDA163FEA77
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
0x76F9BC1378E6526F02AAC038103D4BA6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
0xF3541F2BD1EED699B09653ACCE38833E
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
0x580C383B17F69A2E574C4B1148A71D13
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
0x5301483A7F369001DE5380E7AF300ACC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
0xA65768FAA135C6515B604A7AD7BE60B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
0x5943CE248CAE1ABB042B46EDE979AC87
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
0x76E191FB4F179321824D931C4E2B9977
candle."
0xC235986F196413312C20183F103743B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
0xFA0FE058C8C8E89EC46EC2EBB87B541A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
0x6BA252F2BB6F043D427B8B7E8767787E
is here."
0xEFA03DB0CCC02D81246BB631B6A21EBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
0xCBA4DE6A16B8880009D23A35B62A027F
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
0x1E901550A75830857E578D6AC9558381
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
0xEB994F66C9927AE5557BF1BBC2B4B147
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
0x68084F3A5F72012812A6C02571350601
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
0x100046C1D0A941F2F119B0F1B38B9CBE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
0x36F250045EC804C9148CAD3CF31A2C25
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
0xB441D7C370D22D6479EE377256843D74
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
0xB420419A22AD3DB22260CCCD170946E4
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
0xB767A296450B8B8D914FC3A36CB70683
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
0x4A7BA3D5DC4806F762CA3AE6C4F77D45
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
0x22183AD690C12C28E11AA3C753392520
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
0xAF6C5E247FC1BEBD527A3A022ABF89D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
0x89CC11CA300A0EF96D83728EA98B15DF
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
0x2750645ECF75B2305F04EA1374B0D2A8
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
0x99B6A19E137F058AE26E2B3ED5464FF7
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
0x496DD9C61946A79666916E0612436C26
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
0x8773287ED5CDFA24256370268C81E55D
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
0xCBEE3E0127E500057F79810D20070B6A
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
0x4972EE13A65BC20577102F2742240A33
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
0xAE0BA30591F1A42D12EF72106BF17077
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
0x41912F704925C0AFFF4846EBDF141CB2
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
0x43C85F40711ED9A9A4BCA50E5CC697FE
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
0x9552FDE98ACBAA3F2E9DE9AC833BCFDC
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
0xF18A523CF01B539FF03D6722150EF1BA
neither tall nor graceful.
0x730C04DD82B2C451836B1751A940A3AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
0x689C058E88483BFB270D2F9DD3D51802
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
0xAA5FB1435A4C1D4B423658AF1C18A19C
lifted his head as we approached.
0x4F55E9DED1BA3467BE146C7BBF1B4AC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
0x907B71B8C835F1A3692C2E6F91A8B5B5
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
0x7D0EAE5221F10982BF5AF2A4A968C173

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
0x9BC346723BCB7E676B99FD7D2A7DDEA8
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
0x96F1BD0AF928A23EC4EAEA3563250220
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
0xB0653D742DB905083F189AAA080BAC7E
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
0x84D1A379BBF368561661C821A4081CDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
0xFB30BE62AEA50ABBAFA08C53D495AC6C
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
0x2827CBD4261DAA5FDC47A3319F6BA2E4
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
0x394D51CDCDBB418487ADA01ADE09EEB2
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
0x648CC1978FB38D0F1BEDDED22AFD9CB9
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
0xA6B36A251EF3BB88044FF65FCF405CA4
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
0x27B0CF56A0704196F63F365FA85A05FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
0x15F816A9015832ECF4E57E40B73D829A
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
0x2CCFDD2FA441A06BE1D3C329D8E98408
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
0xBB61622FA80B830B7F49EAEF83F92AC9
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
0x928C8CE1D71294A6E12179F4E1D11DA5
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
0x56FF0A8AA96F3FE3136841316347AFEC
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
0x7C6C23451084DEFF39CF4D95017A858C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
0xFA3E5BA0FEE4289B3F89DAC7A2A87335
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
0x40E1C0BD22A0E023DABC54A73B975A01
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
0x992ED358958B174031F200F524F32A55
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
0x6FB1E7FED346288195FAD49FE2B2F5D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
0xC84D3EE7D5C1DD9540EBED0AED32EB05
might perhaps spill it."
0x74844F81385A6E0ADA710D1BEC6988B5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
0xA349D7FB5FDCDA5A192985E08DEB34EB
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
0x384053476B9CAD60026C74A56EA8DDB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
0xB0670806AC18DF4154330A10950E65F1
votre petit coffre?"
0x4326AD8BBEF26C7AAD6D3B3203F6629F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
0xE5CAC490DA86A030B877C479075E3F38
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
0x168D8F51E17BC9B453BC2369CF16746D
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
0xA45B9DB45B7BFF1B3E79BEEE9B8F4882

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
0x67F2CB0D56DB637EE1A090D05218C161
thought pleasant things."
0x4F590F4A4826E4D7555AAA8AFE608343

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
0x0B0FA0630C291A56A2D33B73D1AC5518

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
0xE555170BE7BE0C20F7E62F38D7EE4742
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
0xD886EDA149380FA9A47AD04DDCDE48E4
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
0x346ACE41AAD4C7BFDB4CD33FE4F0403F
nature."
0x47D0939F5A154CED1C6A96D8D87CB5E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
0x5CD55190BAAEB1100F7317A642BDC828
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
0x78F2599052B578E1C62469CC89208343

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
0xAE0C4BC3E8AD79AAFB2505AA321525E8
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
0x95100250F37996EA6414B961154D77A5
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
0xAFB4585F88B61EE5053492F92732272F
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
0x8F5520CF30F73B978D3C5F4E0613DCD8
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
0x1F0143DC4F10EFF3ED0C343C5DA1A661

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
0xC9A7A7591862DC969AE0409908773B21
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
0xE9AD5082B775D144ED4F9CBB06802831
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
0xDBD12A0E764778CB34B17917ECB11464

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
0x3B4FC6BC637E7C6FF41AB09A9BC3BDBC
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
0x0B6946E34A7764E9DE567ECE14648197

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
0x8E8B4AD6D5EA06EC734ABCE197BA79CD

"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
0x93CED5A8FDEC962D384E7FF6DBD402EA
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
0x3B7D5E866B6E045C8D352A727BA360A2
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
0x525971F5DB2FCE0389F10AA798423D9F
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
0xAD8518A066ABD4687EDAA36C723BD558
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
0xEEEFCD043A0D54B68C6B0944261BEFA8
amuse herself with Pilot.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
0x4EF062BDA6A8887BC8039AD5CE2259C8
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
0x99B624464E34830068FA9930753DB8EC
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
0xD58D5268CCEC6AEF9510E04705E08F5B
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
0x034E253823539627F3D6528A55FD097F
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
0x39676B42BCFBFD9F9BF5A699D43418F2
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"

I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years

0x83A354023CB32F0B571BD47106C8BCBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
0xABB0F3B2543F6259356C94D3C45A413D
wondering what sort of talk this was.
0x5F8164CEE24C7B8C05C2F6B753C977D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
0x21D6634688CD8AD8D4B3A4C65347827A
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
0x48067FAB9FB8F78A96767C33A28D0EAD

Adele."

"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
0x5B254D59E31A07F98244F5741A5346A4
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by

felling my horse."

The widow looked bewildered.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you seen much society?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of

Thornfield."
0x71CD73FFC056769D7C0CE8F8E13BA715

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or

very learned."

"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
0xA288616EB37A77A9FF97794DEF2DCB28
sounds blasphemous."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
0x9DBF659DF6477B41DB233DCFD6EE54EF
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
0x7EFB2662E86361679D7D973723D2CBB9
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
0x740D8D785E0C992E61E62331556E29DE
caught the drift of the dialogue.

Rochester.
0xBCDC483C9AE6989A807D1E6ED9A3761D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision

department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
0x49A8364D372CFA5FE5FA97F1747C7CF4
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
0xC30FFF4E9760441AE4E49298393B3CFA
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
0x89BC11536FD52AE775E211388804C817
to bed."
0x1E3270461310B39C863CA889BDBEF4D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
0xA89ACD5A94710000DC905831764DFF0B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I assented.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
0x57102CD9AE3D6A9E619090F2895CBA48
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
0xD32ABAED4B892F8D17DE17A7D5A05F47
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
0xF74E2A11B9DA69769BB5B8F51B64EB41
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
0x00589BF0E04B96FC09F8BFF4A3F4C908

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A little."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,

if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
0x690661F5E8C059C5E63E078A474C3B49
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new

0x98A75F1E3771AB7A60C6650EF5D1BAF1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I departed, obeying his directions.
0xE560FF1D51341023526C2BF40D5D522A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
0x04F686138158C1EAE8BEE81E7EDC056A
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
0xCA5ADED31B5BCA092A6AD4D6B64849ED
not well."
0x45D97D059685FCEB0618EB59F5B3599C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
0x8ECE326F7ABCA55695C0ACF9D0F24133
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
0xFDBC42EAB4E630CB5631551501AC9A30
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
0xEADA4072BC599AEA7A64FD8E6E6439A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, indeed!" I interjected.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
0x4818DBCC6520744EB4E1F16E662A824D
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
0x92EAD9EF2FF7E3DFDAA70C03C607E503
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
0x9AF993536244C88B1E136DA9E35D7B22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I brought the portfolio from the library.
0x24C7A68E61ED59D03C4E74D2E0C45344

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
0x9C14F69857D2ADCEA67475A133904E0C
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
0x17A6673993F2565882AB96294E0AC0FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
0x22B3C89EF1BF1DF481DDC174F9ADCD0B
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
0x6A553ABBDB2A102217294FB2FB02D648

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
0x596BB10E4E2ECE7E90FA382B3FE1270F
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
0x60E1E1832AB4C6AA9BFA90BA60103616

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
0xD1E67B2745235FC19C7D82B1981BD14B
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my

questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that

hand yours?"
0x4204A180E380901B65CCF32C299BAC2C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
0x604F60C89B59B44D9066A9A247A74944
some thought."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
0xA37AB96FD77BDE5B3DAE57231E5CF612

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
0xFC801D0B4519737D2B9BE0786875136C
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
0x1BA708585DA39ABF8D88BD412090F245
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
0x8BA31F327EBB41AB6BADD8892095563B
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
0xACDE116648DCE5D4265DB24F1F22FFF7
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
0x5B9F7F3F357073C2502729D48E214A53
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
0x439BE9EFA25163B75FA986C443EB9338

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
0xFCDD0C9B11EFE2A7B474158639F6574B
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
0x89BA7F6E222ECBE9F50D55035767C742
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
0x374A2B41359A8027FF0DB75F199854BD
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
0x9451629F2DC1D6D95BADEF00BF18231F
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
0x9F0B51CA89077988BF5A2E37D2629D14
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
0x86D35C7F993A4CFB71385805C9EB3CEE
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
0x974246489FC01009C2BCF9A3DF4EE4AF
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
0xF4CD792C658B266786E3CBCCAFB13B6B
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
0x2DE3F20D6433E0B2C6825C961E773D20
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
0x2FCDAA358FA4C5AA76286582FF36B9F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
0x17DFE0C45D0D4ABDC566EF762DEF428E
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
0x19F176FF5FE0F644DBC21382C1A35178
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
0xFCE51D7F3F48E36C205F31522A37F75C
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
0x1780A7F9E41882A050DDE7E9485B0103
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
0x5EF39DE6C5AAAE30F1CAA11A3390FF7D
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
0x80BDDEC72E8779540A2051B4D347C6F8
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
0xEAECF8FB1BC855BF7BDE579B5377AD9A
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
0x47725171BF2390606FFF49F8FE8C4525
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
0xCC796B7661D268A5CACAB491E44755D9
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
0x83F5C46169AD08ABD4F9A518C37D0E96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
0xA830ADEB5FD2EE9C223CACBE8A11914C
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
0x0DD9BBEAF45E67732CF1B9BC1295D94C
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
0xC36A560D105ED4D7D82C5ADEC04DCDEE
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
0xBBB4A31811F6652E2559744A481FB5C8
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
0xD41AF74F41F26057C55937CEF1E052C6
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
0x2512A88AD4CFC98644E3567AF0898257
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
0x501579609FCC3D6C2C7487A4F42139BF
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
0xB97DD080A191507C5B83B0B11A795D0D
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
0xC01A901E9AEBEA191A0577E30D3CB15C
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
0x8C5F83F6BD6C68662477C16A36250861
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
0x414C5CE26C1516FCD2F135E9FC76D30E
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
0xAC1E3D2A18A166BE79BB40FB3E9E6B06

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
0x5E27CC397B42838F524E30C5C3A3365E
presently.
0x978FA7472688869F444DF187E69585E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
0x20842975A3D3E5FA4229871FEBBCC3ED
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
0x871F8AE2943B0BC2F6933DBDB7346A6B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
0x82228F46A5674F959160EB0DC3922D9C
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
0x785E8A2CAD3EC587E5EC3B6007F9E48C
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
0xC68FFD0503AC9DE4CF49EB15035FACFC
each day?"
0x2060BC5495936F6310FABF80910EF3A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
0x29B31373EF2D9D0E90817BA7B4595463
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
0x83E229230EA3B3C20DD3B952DAF41A6F
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
0xAA1F4D8648EFD3F07E6560F17770F334

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
0x2741A8449F046EDEB2A1D99297B17E00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
0x2A100744F37DA8FCF13870E1A25C2639
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
0xDE90B5B94B9A4B72954996DB31DED619
powerless to realise."
0xFEDCAAD945FEFB8BDCDD1D96C0250B4D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
0x016F577A4471B1D7138CE0CC7BFDCB9F
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
0xFD9C06B4F5DD1C8E2242250B827F59B1
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
0xE0660B797DF159C5AE67DA40CBFD48E7
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
0x6EB73A348089D2CDCFB237B30FCCBAB8
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
0xDB9B942B27F1FEB8107DF45156006E91
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
0xF16BC9F0DB4FBC5942ABF24CF77DDAE5
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
0x9EA862AFE00327536177BF2F69155E32
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
0x69601E7F24365BAE48EE3514E16CA49F
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
0x28DFFA85AA9B6BB7947B3D78356F7A97

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
0x9C9572CE5FBBBACE4569D6399401387E
watch, he said abruptly--
0x8FFB81F5792BA303044014B61D66B913

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
0xE4C4AF33FE936BB49E73D54E64D2AF52
so long?  Take her to bed."
0x23C357F4A98C01974E15A35AAE3FDB78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
0x704A419899D607491A86694F43DC15D3
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
0x7107B42E0605FD86C0382BB19EA0800F
much.
0xFF2A218BFF2A218B71484715C3B4484C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
0x158FCEBD4294BF8CDF09C1C84F4EF30F
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
0x7F89FF6B2745747A00671042D28B93FE
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
0x4E1E7C9637DB650A6B338968DBBCAB4B
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
0x41A921CE8797E97B0C9A3CC9B86DEAE2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
0xFE0ADC56158024AADC1361AA6435C505
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
0x53A35C3987A460B823B21310D1DED52F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, is he?"
0x4E3BA0FB748F6F52390DEEC4A31F8D97

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
0xC77CED8E7B8586769A5EE70E2CF46A98

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
0x5B336F53F312A1CB8F7DDE700EC1DA5C
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
0xFED63F20291A54311CF8ED6F1C10EC04
temper, allowance should be made."
0x8ABCFE5CDC018CEA11C262D5A05C89EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why?"
0x945337BB945337BBAA9B489B8A1EF709

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
0xE5F784BEEF41ECAED33F87671096B059
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
0xF793E5A48CA3F24F884E10A19AB01F38
make his spirits unequal."
0xD4D211A3414959331F31D4FBE0C67B81

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What about?"
0xDC79BA99BFDC3AA90865450DC03C0069

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Family troubles, for one thing."
0xA187D0D5B42B90F9E45413EBEF9FFEA5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But he has no family."
0xA7A2C67CB869F49B6EE9325E99861A6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
0x6E6362FACB82960F134C8402935C625C
brother a few years since."
0x445D33A7E0DCB8E13E6F2FCE521E6406

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"His _elder_ brother?"
0xCF508322315AA5FB4602A7FF9DFA4DA0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
0xAAD9F78401D066CA1242FD6F6146C62E
the property; only about nine years."
0xF3DCD1007528868B437B4B2C866669EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
0xBE3B14D37FB2D2FE003EC8B181B4C717
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
0x1154FBBCF97ED1EE422388736B6694D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
0xF99524E380BE52DEE16EE3D582B5CC13
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
0xDAF370A9CEDD40F2A7787D8F754C717F
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
0xEF92E02EF4581E55104DD7ED91F4C4D8
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
0x4C5AE2D9D5F2105E6A10339640109098
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
0xAF778ED08111AE3D8E1EFA122A90A183
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
0xF77917F0822A5693163025D145AE6313
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
0xB5D2AB94536CAD38B87CF1892E08BC19
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
0x4C0FFF71EBEDA7573494F6567CCC367A
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
0xA5E27F937ADDAF4AB6FEA8ACCE312475
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
0x7995E7664BB6C6706B1DE7DEA4E03BAF
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
0x991819EBBF085E6CA4107A41D755EF2E
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
0x2DE78C4BB80173DED766EF69A6D318E0
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
0xB13874DFD5F335AF4D34A7BBC60B9353
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
0x0914D4FF615BA6FD7A66A28B847C11A9
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
0x988C888A4F6B5EEBB3204956F6AD245B
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
0x10C32FD291B5CAA84A576C944BD380FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why should he shun it?"
0x0361CA4B85DA68C2C9DC096A05F962A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
0x27BC74ADC0F6F63B201D340259C3946A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
0x501745518411924EDE2AD2C642973694
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
0xF26BB2C8035F3C4F2B600CDEA04A108D
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
0xC997F99240FEB6BA2DF4B3270F746D26
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
0x4DE098CC690667414347A29A4CF6C59B
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
0x67EF3CBE8645ABB7235A0B61FF83B096
subject, which I did accordingly.

CHAPTER XIV
0x40C77B6711F7C7D63B05629E21B496C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
0x55FABEF0E4EF02EAF6B143ED7EAF165C
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
0x9D44E8EE7DCED0025116C5038CF188E9
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
0x0E984A2132D5A60EB99625F212903658
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
0x2F751BD8876AC3E2283BB1A24A8B9C00
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
0x8BE09C6773973B4A8F366857B26499CF
generally did not come back till late at night.
0x3032D97B05E38A7133AFBACC491D2D1F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
0x3FEE2C9C6AFF243744ABCCDD62441489
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
0xC088E299447A9637BF4E3EBC1612ADF1
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
0xA7CC80F17A5ED62DE39AABF2CB786594
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
0x767257E81E61192261C9DB16F2925E83
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
0x17C31F9F9BFA3ED72D77BD9F4C57865E
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
0xDA02E79459044ED8B765761245517CE8
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
0xD05B3C6156F39945B3D776A87C966F65
causes quite disconnected with me.
0xB9E016299A82B5700F40258AB307F8F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
0xB44520C94BFE126187B339D987C51365
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
0x0C3BF1BC68C681D2A2A2055C8B5D4E56
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
0xA97074B0171C5E1AE97069C35E9E122D
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
0x66BDCBAE000620D10213EB2F620E6A07
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
0xED4B343A7CAE25572195FF5390FE8634
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
0xE5D8B28B785B79B1F2FE0390842CAB53
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
0x8F2FF94C771EDAF7802C1AB2BF36FFC7
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
0xECCCB74404B24C8E36E2F67B949FFC16
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
0x358501A4C1FAEE5F18B5661081D23DCE
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
0x93E5BECEEC4D4980ADFF4BD855ACEF00
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
0x6FA935CC1849D207FCEA2BAD093152BD
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
0xCE4DCA57DAD579875867F98D831BCECB
She appeared to know it by instinct.
0xD2D07F7D06D84212BE7FC14EE93F0049

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
0x6E30E4B8FB0DCE2A345CCABABAE9BC00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
0xFC564DF7BEE699D4C4919F3233B09296
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
0xAB5332649D86A1FCCB6798C137029FDE
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
0xC097A41514A7D2F4177CC791B443DDB2
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
0x288DEBF55F9FD34B8506C056A5F88F0F
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
0x4778D4185C2DB1A5F760792E00B2270E
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
0x0C3C7C5D6196C9D55741E1BA3759E3EF
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
0x8D87E0FB2B732661387893C8634F94C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
0x10EF5E5B7433772837C21F0B865AD847
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
0x9BB2C49567E7872EC805639E5BA5BD00
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
0xBDF9D7DEFC41CD1E289CB21B3B318C7A
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
0xE515D217145AD4321D45E3F37DD854AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
0x4E52F2A1A0C47017DC1E3D319DBCE1FD
contemplation.
0x2095A52998703204D99220BD5E631C3C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
0x67D8C766A0B28CC604287E61E0D6750F
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
0xF3FD18231400ECFFE7FE7DFF48DBCCA0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
0x442F955B6E81152CBC76B67B526E6D2D
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
0x127769590085245A1980BB97B1D09B99
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
0x1F372674A81DDFF0E3942A006BFAB07F
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
0x7DA3FF4DBD11FD81B75F227266ED9D6F
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
0x3ED06A1A7D753C6AA62F56F1030B21FC
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
0x45FB8CAF425AF0C85E2761BC33A8438E
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
0x015D179EAE1B0930B848DE62A096E8E8
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
0xABA1DDCE48E5B6C7604F3D1B975E0A3C
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
0x8872409E51D4C4509AAD96D0B249F9E3
said to be thicker than water."
0xF37067F63893A9412B01AC43F9C5291F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
0x0643077B6D349A8D43E86C5AB2FA600C
knitting-basket in hand.
0x5828698B6D72D9F2DCD5D590DEB21370

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
0xA997799E8CE707531940A7243A3B899D
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
0x42C56C54631D17BA74BEFA5AB4C5BD81
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
0x9F38A19751797CECB92C9445ACD96C3E
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
0xA5941421797159F0C22AA528CEAB60D1
performed."
0xB8B9839FB14C26EF266AF48F77550FAB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
0x38DFBED3060EEAC3ED22A22845749B9B
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
0x1D3C37A3526FE814BB3403122C53F3EB
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
0x0507FFC1CE6CB3AE98B4599711F4B09F
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
0x2967AB75BB8ADD95B6D2D13E9744B96C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
0x15ACF6A6949162F6EF2C039AFCDF2493
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
0x716B0AE05D3D6F0CA4FF327392626A88
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
0x995E22A7397D763FCD92E0C3A4E2E2D1
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
0xA2E49EE6B0F7C76598E3F2294E669F67
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
0xB9217955EB6FF56907D4F2140313CCA1
mind to do."
0x196D7944473F07832F2D063999EAE6F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
0xDA27ACB55FAECFD696362179E7EA7489
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
0xB6B2EBF27E9C03EF2BA39F4C39BFF460
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
0x64826C4073ED8BC0A02697E0622FC556

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
0xB210BB6F451E9F07A12520408374AADF
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
0xFD796D31B66AF4593A8DE04654112285
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
0xA2F62114F8C50770F0E94A8436A06726
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
0xE5B727A7C772DF9ED3794F7C1B76B85A
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
0xC6DA3BF70AC0BA2A23152165D2A9A32B
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
0x85F52FD20AE13AB51F05C63955FD7FAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
0x3F4B71A10BA27538159149721F004A08
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
0x48F0663C5C078401F72DC5568C9AC80F
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
0x57340A75C83157B3C150B26BDD33A708
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
0xAFDEF4C39939C8181BD14DAB2541881D
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
0x6882A0901D122D0F844BBA7A913A63EF
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
0xD1FC247877C9F8B33893ED7BFE77B872
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
0x5DB69754FB871905A659A9FFF73E6423
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
0xD9B1AD6D071147E75A3E04983B2BF4D8
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
0x7796FBEC249017CFEA2C795AB5311C8C
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
0xCDB75E231527BA5F7AE357CA71368573
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
0xDAB295169FE0A3965BEF41FA76AD4246
feeling.
0x8611CE39DD87C36B71046ECACD13FED7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
0x1E656EFF416C400ECF2B908E46B672DD
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
0x17FC05F4BB2F416785DBB2BE2FB0F155
fastened on his physiognomy.
0x1CFD6547FF746E667FAE286E71CCA95B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
0x8391900369647984AF01C554C2EF9AC4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
0x7112FDA9FACBE29CA39D65521236C8FE
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
0x97BEA3AB399813FADEB940CE5256912A
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
0x4879692600A47391A602F2163F304106

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
0xEBC875AC6B2587C5FEF0E53122EFA63C
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
0xE3A4171797715DFA301D940CE00225F4
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
0xC2564EA4B4835D7DB4A0E91B9EC91AFE
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
0x9DCFB599B7AAF9788F93A05FF77B8DF5
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
0x0D45BDB84FA4E3EC3A65454577530085
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
0xC3D307D5C0549CF95119FCA5E47BE120
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
0xE369D13BAF83BAC5294C3678A71A69EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
0x55A6AA350ED9A53719DE5CFABCC1C42A
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
0x0B9865B9329D4F233D833E956B7432BF
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
0xA7945895B19EA90A28484B049CC914DA
consequence, or something of that sort."
0x084805A248699EDFC5A47F50245CDAF0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
0xECD0678487A4923412E9210148899068
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
0x0A1CB5FBFB7E8A3B2A90E5C8D8B1CD62
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
0x21CC3717749E342FC5F911A605A78A0D
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
0xB41467331ADDF6A40F697DE895A96AF3
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
0xFC6C1AA188912BDBC42183D879D5AF82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
0x71D45A005EA4D79C541C54D0CB536DB4
repartee: it was only a blunder."
0xAD26951E3A65C441DA0F180AF190B8DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
0x4F1225AD80D74615810BA045C1CF1E07
does my forehead not please you?"
0xF775E141E2D98506071683C7248C5F1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
0x36A6C17A4117A2F69FEA31F1A10F8B48
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
0x6CAA94D2B0C0B8F4D19C28B73CF13EF6
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
0x7986117E4AB71FA9983A65B599DA427C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
0x543FDB89A812C5212EFD312C39297848

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
0x038F58CFDA64C27BB4DB23EAF767F8B2
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
0x2F93CFD0AA1B6510F79B26B3F9FFF5C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
0xB268DB512922F493EB478E947440AEC9
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
0x8F342F94C5BDA923EF840604381CFCA0
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
0xBAF260305D0CBEE311BF90511BB1BF76
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
0xF08319434CA48DC7BFDFFAA043AC6624
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
0xF7F407EEDE29C405DB7A26F8FEFB0370
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
0x4AE90E6E2A13D32DBC881E54724DD389
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
0xC59B9F93CFAA5DE51BCF2E4576C662B2
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
0x9591081BC143BB70542A672EB8C50124
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
0xF61DFAEA2DE43C79E3F30024748B44C3
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
0x398EC95CBF380479E233A9D413593999
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
0x99174454A2EC54C957674E8CDCE01C68
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
0x6F990E38702F294F470FC6F0214BBAFF
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
0x533A933859C0248A7CDF62FFBEA531BF
me?"
0xEEDD836EEEDD836EC126337F5C6039E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hope of what, sir?"
0x3B5C9B3501DFBF9047DCD3623D7BD94F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
0x51D131EA778C3472130F400985727AEC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
0x990CEE54C8FAC0613CF202881B319720
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
0x39CD09C83304A59D5A2F440BA1CFC3B5
capable of being re-transformed?
0x87A4C443AFAA3F6C946CD6DE4C83249B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
0xC34BC970E7A070D27AE0EBF1CFB69ED2
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
0x10F046CDF0EFA729996D209E47A9D9BE
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
0x572164CD7FF2E87DD40CDED7308027DF
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
0x289D14B6A70B3F1F4AF5DABB61609301
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
0x9FA38CCFAF4729BE7784D78ADB675E58
to-night."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
0x6605A5B12B6B26ED2857A24EB93E1B65
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
0x4D277E885C7D79C6638502301FEA1238
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
0xBA0CEFD610E416F8CDC4A814B0618576
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
0x46A4316B6C842A8294FB55D81D2B58B7
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
0xFD3E8D50CEE4E3CDC72A662F3BE6F3B8
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
0xD7CB64C6EAEC38F4CC14184E3A226E7C
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
0x90F7585EF16F42AB31C3283AEDAFF6F4
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
0xB79B6EB6D213ED5964E2E003CF10A2A3
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
0xF1F2DBC4013B27AAF8C58D914F44C52B
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
0x41254D5BD3C4AF8BD33363242E3573DD
confidence.
0x8EEAE7F2877812EA4D952B475709EFE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
0xF060761994C2F7634D06BAB516B892CE
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
0x642FA23F97436FA501E1F0054416B7D4
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
0xAE1DC3E5E9B6B481048CBB10D017B68D
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
0x227809A0ACC2694E3AC94353734FA9A5
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
0x3082D1701F36EF3F5591A1DEA1826E2E
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
0x83F9D62B60EDA0F348910C1A3521CC82
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
0x3C26E85226E75932DF042C1CB7786D55
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
0xB2DC0BD91C5C73DB66E575E11CC68B71
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
0xE8EF3578CA38CA55CCCC80EFED43A8FE
you--therefore speak."
0xDB36A63EDC3E8B163F9A501BFE422AD1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
0x4D5B19F43DFDF16DEC9A6A10A17CD5ED
smile either.
0xE238D63D857EC77DDD9054304351ADC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Speak," he urged.
0xAD87ACDF758F468DF1E1BEF9ACD3C1DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What about, sir?"
0xBC1ECDDD34481B6C9EBDDDEF181B07BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
0xD879EA71DDA24CB3627D85C4AB4A1B09
treating it entirely to yourself."
0xB1441C4F1D7BA003497EFCE002718B6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
0xF5A1F6EFA7903576C0369F1C22206E8C
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
0xBC2F3BD4C78CAD6AF87FE88D9CAD49F2
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
0xCB4E97D4FB64763FAB10BBB4901B2492

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
0x90D464BDA839BA7AE5EC6BBD7FEEB842

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
0x7AC4C3B2895876D678E82B9D82EF754A
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
0xDBB76C0413959C69B81D92FA692C554F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
0x860805763FD24E885F7D5453859BE4B4
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
0x8F9BB9E8EEE4C9F137BCFDA9680381FA
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
0x9A7D140A849865B58B0BFE949AED35E5
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
0x69CC7A45D81AE29225ED74CC1807BA21
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
0xF2CF1118A799F152CDB16628E3FAC6C6
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
0x5A1BED46E0E49FCF55202141AF42D6DC
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
0x0EED0D546A39B08ABA3A0DABC86DC439
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
0x1F73E716449CDD6373D0C72BA5C362A5
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
0x4C4A37F27DD7DBCBB2F05555007EE9CD
rusty nail."
0xA2F8581AB340B8CC95CD360E6EFF8369

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
0x995686DF968AAD59275EDEF1FD34B32F
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
0x75DB08947A61B7CBC692D8E87CF2398C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
0xEA3B34FFBCAF87111398B1AA30F9A07F
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
0x6135E611DDB90839152B44F37F474881
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
0xFCF0AB0D7D2E56DD73E0F557CF14F2D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
0x5071144F80B25F5DA0DC5223EFE4E8D8
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
0x31E758EB1D2AFDA7291545B1728C0A48
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
0x47D4EB4351C01AA58FD765265825C13F
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
0x2AC5AF23C2E1014A3148380385451577
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
0x0BF7B38686F9D517D889625B24279A82
people in one house?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very

evasive one.  Reply clearly."
0x02E4EF6D55B01BDCD3A6DFFC3B8BC40B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
0xA90E03C24E7D70DA9C8A2C53846B1908
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
0x444F415A08ABF154F702FE956ED83768
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
0x4EF4A1AC5A1923A40277DE3F9D149AC2
and experience."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
0x70954D64162062DB420DEA79BED24E22
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
0xF0C9598632E60E89E9E00E75B467596A
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
0xAA03FC233976D93D6AE0D5CB47E45A67
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
0xEB13193084A25B4E4280D4E89DF5846D
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
0x68FB0E8939D786A44765179A7483B85C
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
0x03142730EC1FFD85874364FB998691C7
expression; "but speak too."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
0x98D1A19380CB614B06797A7D00C5DECB
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
0xC021AB753EA1CAAB7E9C7FD5C352AAB7
their orders."

"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
0xAEBCD0041E5153A102395460740CA64B
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
0xA37F43541BD3A22267780FAC78AE433F
you agree to let me hector a little?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
0x6966A7F7EDE6AC4E5197EAA514246A46
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
0x170C5FEBA1323A9E8278B1D674AC3AC0

"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms

and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
0xFB9234E99A476A5A6347571095707F7E
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
0xC1282041C3264BFBABF34F606747EF83
salary."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
0xFCDB2891F2F0C6F8F94388823BAD2046
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
0xE04E8736071366FCE5B0C5DA063147B5
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
0xF0135FF21FA9AF52E2D8C0F34477F91F
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
0x66234513B74CF7ECF9202C0A340F3D03
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
0xDB82994FCAA8A1A76DD3834CA686B6C1
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
0xE07E01374596A64ED20B45B3B81BAC9C
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
0x488EB049F4B91609D99FAD44CA4F20B9
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
0xF103A7BE76732F709621B911619BD987
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
0x5EE1869A422A23F73E3B2DD79315DC72
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
0x3389F4A1F33D5FA79B117A05529A8F32
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
0xBCBE184BB1464281F9D73119A48EEFC2
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
0x80C32AF80CAAF5FA4841E52295593091
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
0x2124AA5F1EBE73E4A48C1D548D931F62
defects to counterbalance your few good points."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
0x22018C3CD5806ABC1B6161A455AC0E3D
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
0x9D29E47DDE2CCC880218838C276181AD
as well as imagined--
0x9211527A347D0920B2B60DDCC484799D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
0xD3DA0B7383147257F52B378EE60EB75A
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
0x6262142C4C1A28131696B904E78F141B
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
0xD8D1DC77203AD5ABB0AF09BB74350DBB
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
0x33292D0DC04D1050095CA4C580CC2567
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
0xD9892FE859BE1406B98C990767DEA239
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
0xF5A27170C90F5A8B7D729F8ADE02C2C5
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
0x73464F29A90866FC3CB7ECC0C1D3CF16
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
0xDB99F867179E375764060D3067158CE5
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
0x16BE8834FC1D17DF0E55A5FDC3539DFC
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
0x7DC852064384551BA44317918B91C77B
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
0x206C93B845B922727D58AE2997CCD483
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
0xEF3DE99B87FAE72E04F95E9F1BD4DE92
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
0xDEB55895E1F21BC8D4C1B6924CE42DC7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
0x337C1BC05929610B844BB65157EBD189
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
0x7A312894000954ADE18B89039A9A78FE
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
0xC864D7B57578015DFE218FEDC6549135
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
0x3DE9094E5F5C0A741ADB2EEEDC85702F
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
0xC805717A1ED0C4700C02E5647D32BE22
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
0x7FB40E078CEE257F7794AA256841AF25
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
0xE95CE193DDC12C2C1A78AC0E25C0F08F
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
0x4FFBDE347A401B293C70089EC711556B
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
0xE12E2283A2A166742DC6F4ACA2158B03
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
0xC0A66757B5A0B2421DE53454D0128D30
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
0x2F616E978395587EC89678060B51ABAE
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
0x960DE76556393964917C796DFDB2F4D5
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
0xAD074C4D42C24254D1AE7ED1B4C9149D
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
0x636B2B9CC73BEEA106DB350FB102CF22
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
0x72C546F41DA4E18049D28916B08EB1EF
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
0x3400061E6B68B2A05616A0E8AA14EF2D
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
0xDD1CB0FA5020D48131424E0CA4DE09DF
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."

"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were

superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
0xB578269A8AFC4E86673ECA13A432D1C1
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
0x8F1F87B0D0FD45161F10F27012F988C9
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites

my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am

you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you

to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to

watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious

out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in

miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the

entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of

rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be

gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of

rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings

reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,

"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English

gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss

Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
0x3FFB4B5503B1E983E2049AAB9706924C
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
0x4C9A4AE97C4FE70E824D224574D28A89
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
0x979A8582A59A2B88BECD89E6E9E1E13C
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
0x396AE0CA38454FBA6171266872D18981
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
0xECDE59FEE59F48F855839853374663FB
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
0xBC25FA59D84CB5D637417DBBEB0496A1
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
0xDC7266DBCE54FED31AFF7181B4CE5B3E
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
0x4299E0B171B494579D2A803DC3EB0245
Good-night."

Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
0xBB9ED811CCC863041D56A0BA6A0B0D29
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
0xED8D4FA6681D12F6315B3264ABCDE92F
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
0xD12D8111FD48794367886A7FE17A8FA7
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
0xA3ED6506FEBC15CA9A6A002AE05AE3FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
0x175F08044428A5D79B71870BCCE3C5B4
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
0x2664591CFEE7EBE5FBDE46A1E6FD4714
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
0x6930874807494C1DCFE532CAAF667E44
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
0x7A9BF41EDBDF5FA132264B921906B89E
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
0x8B21829DBCFE48924FD56F3A17BA478F
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
0xCF1960DB20D9663112380B59E53899F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
0x659CCE6B22B9A4492E9F27B2279C5CE9
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
0x924F5847F3517769B46BCFDD20718F10
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
0xE027B62FB56CBB181D1EC8A27222FE55
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
0xE422EF1D39FF1C3E9D316AF8652BEE87
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
0x5C5BA386F0BD6F6276B8B13AA0B910BC
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
0xCEB344A1F24C9719AE72122CB1CC4C2E
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
0x9BF5C83D99BF6D54EB3D4B5171E1F1D0
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
0xDD332961DBD1FC4C46EA44CD3BF707A1
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
0xD6FFEE6FBE1F4B585BA7FF1B9F8B0F4A
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
0x4C61BAAD0D5C0E60413C6B22614B1508
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
0x7AC1BFF8E59A21C03435E4BBCFEF5330
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
0xB16DC833E2F979BC301998CB2310827E
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
0xB9469EC4554CA13CDA3A06E404C04746
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
0x64287749643B9FD7E27595F200D4E003
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
0x02C0F9AAFFBEE7166D93C5020DB22D70
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
0xE7A5605A67518C5719B71CCBD6CD8C62
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
0x29BFB1CD8E7AA3C2807AE5D7409D041A
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
0x5E78448D8B9D4E0E502B998865B3FBFD
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
0x9E56CAC47352C2B0455412AC71AF13EB
now, if you will excuse me."
0x186F7910710FA7755EC4CFA2E476689A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
0x97653590CF273D489388D3FBF26DD15F
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
0xC88FAC0B618867233F1FF36F3D87D7E7
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
0x773340162879D3CE3DA872DE9E1F41A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
0x23863763487697B3B116E3C5B062D3F3
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
0x07B3297B5F2DAAA6A299678EFA1C21B1
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
0x55CD044379AAF762B03DCC6CC7EB09C0
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
0x6CE153B9C7B7F6464FB540B2EC7F70D8
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
0x2DE330602F18DE55E0915DAC2D631EE4
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
0x13E95B82C345CD32BBBFAF5199A8D7B4
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
0x186B21F7CA11C533A79018E6A9EDA59E
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
0xE067ACB675D7285B99CEE6CEF31A7C09
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
0xE0D1568D6E5F8BC28DB1A84F7AC94120
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
0xD1F9D0B841E6DC156F9059942A985221
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
0x5464673FAB50AD9680180BD81C7C1528
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
0x11BFFB1AC64F0326DFADA94714DD4C46
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
0xAD7C4E063728E23084956771435A1776
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
0xD60863D502096535DD7EFF1D96B49AF2
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
0xABCC12A9B52FB9E215C13C1BA5B1C851
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
0xFBD111BE8DB0D760C2319B457797A984
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
0x951086019F30B84A53F7BC85CD2AE3E5
cochere_ of the hotel.
0x06DDF2FD9AA23F565DAAF978F03576A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
0x0A5A564DA54D858E754C25FA9380D2E6
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
0x62FB978BABCF5B711EB33EE8863F6062
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
0xC9DC7A1586731F41080E49ADB9240C32
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
0x5F3B6DD766A3E8C64850A5354F635D46
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
0xFE33330C53F8EDC99AF4EE782A354450
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
0x5329CD16E551F90F9FC20EC9D9043AC3
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
0x0C778EF2B0AF35D99791967C3537CC7E
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
0x934B6CF1BDD34E51FE7E8F595157DB7A
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
0x86B205FE8557B9DE466C857F188F2EE4
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
0xD5365363CE69EB5A2299545951CCB7A6
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
0xA31DAFD3DEE49E64F1921FECE3731C9B
current--as I am now.
0x08E84B5B6022688CEADE0CAEFBD73D81

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
0x1AD114D17622C0E80DBE5E0EF87CE85F
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
0x9228A7256B91F7A5BA622DF7B43ADFE1
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
0x09BBB1E214BEFF00290CFE7C764EBFC8
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
0xAE2DC436E675229DC1EC4179F0C9D4A4
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
0x3786C742C9DB1960E59B0C36083F14C5
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
0x8F041897B5E84C699D4B5DD32D8F1F92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
0xBCC73E1137091745894648B6DBDF25BA
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
0x8AF497D9B82F847D5BAE2978610290F7
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
0xBE89E9F512E1E025623406CD81F5FE6D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
0x33A68CDAA38DD65F670EF88B6683295A
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
0x78FA90EF7326C1C924F216982BFB9EF4
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
0x337CE9534D8A344723EB6AB15D5561D6
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
0xBCF4BE5144D542169800B3DF0394069D
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
0xD4D787DA9DFC0269A0AFE71452589239
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
0x4049C6062CCBDAC5B27BEBBC1A3B61F5
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
0x82404EE14D1E124D180578E614C8AA9F
his countenance: he went on--
0x5240CE83DDB3CE9B6BBF62C517F9A547

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
0x59AFF3E604E09F1C43FF8B3A592B1BE3
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
0x106EDBE852A9556891C8D0C058BC7328
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
0x29B787653B0CD071BE2EB76E9A52596A
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
0xF10FFC718201450886ABF049CAA17B6F
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
0x947FD53C75A85D62D7F85F97767FBE61
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
0xB18D75B938F9FCD7462408B5ECA6EDAC
if you dare!'
0xA48D7439B7E551B99FD58EF5572E982C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
0x6C31E654490A1ADE9615CD51DE409210
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
0x321CDDF14A8FF021151211C657E826CE
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
0x29A8067D2AB9F07815E6B4D7EE909258
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
0x6047C73BAA3141E40FC07B1157BD40D8
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
0x8B4881A13732FD96EC806D4CAB3F5B91
but straw and rotten wood."
0x83E96761BF7EE998A81D26850A4F8ECD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
0x1C9A59E2752909BF716001DAE0E8C2C4
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
0x58EFA70F29E391748D67BFB4E8ADCC31
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
0xEBFE2F84BE5328D1131C42363105C3A6
whence he had abruptly diverged--
0x5A8AD14244C4633D169BF6A6DB4FC22C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
0x2D7549F248C0766AA976A0F0104000FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
0x00017F7C0260BECAA60B2C38B2F12AE8
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
0xD7CD1D45FF4E4835324816298479CF3B
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
0x71D168EA2AD01D0C77189BDBD8B615F4
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
0xB97DEF421B7F840A35E518A3D955F0D7
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
0xA10AF9630E5269E20AC772A1E8EB9F31
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
0x5CD9292CC76A0C1B6237F40C943D9BA7
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
0xE6FC803EF32C22C506E11C14E54A1A4F
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
0x2656F01836D7D61F04A27991F6502B64
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
0x1EABA3619203A93488B41E19113E48EB
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
0x03149DF45D6D4E6938075CFED2E619C2
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
0x4316966306F835F77ACC50BA71DC6D7D
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
0xF7EABFFD0B08E6C8EB6296B22F9C3FF6
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
0x4DD830796F189AB70EF58C5F9B80020E
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
0xB381DAE67090E37D7CF31DAB7DF8D62B
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
0x565F283AF9EDDF8174C3C48737DEBD76
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
0x769D9755850B1B135C1BE219855064D0
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
0x8ACE11526BA6CACE7F6B759254D6F4A7
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
0x666B8E25B98B113C640EF1CD38EC9040
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
0x5CC91F485DA372C532BE8132FEFBDAE2
After this digression he proceeded--
0xBAA3F02B73EC0A5420A16E105E3E3382

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
0x8715A85699A62264831FB26BFE5738AF
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
0xE60E0C154F34397466722C3C157DB4CC
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
0xBEF63C263005512254F943DC8D2958E1
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
0x8751A0F6A43D29F8A40F50FE12A38F1B
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
0xCBABAC64A8803A6741F6F5D9A1AF4BFB
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
0x91A7723B92ACF7DCD476D8222167D06E
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
0x0F4CDD966E56E030CC2020DF98B99DF8
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
0x1B4676554E1291BC405EE49438582AB5
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
0x5818DC83EF561AC226688D4E4CEE38DD
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
0x0C84EE742796456091077D0E9796BEEC
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
0xA0AFF010B5438AD9B90ED9E040EBC3D0
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
0x0D9843896FB3544394A4092ADA1CDD0A
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
0x1CAEA9714454766927D5C346AF0E52AC
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
0x5E8C2CAEF47BADC7543FA2667DD2A201
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank

under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
0x351F17A1A3C7A944E54EE74F4F5C5FD4
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
0xB4F5E01BED3907F14A825A572E7FB737
who had been her dupe.

"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
0xBB2ABB01CCED5BC1F9D856DF92D85F59
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
0x46F07FD9D1D435C5DD7E5F6C6D2D6511
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
0x7ABE9D4814EB533339C7911D5981CE5D
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
0x0D4D1C5377350833794A2D0A55532DD8
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
0xC592DF1691494A3B33A07C4E66DB139C
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
0xE0E08490907581ADC9DE0B900442C888
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
0xB2F70765518E4B5D8DBAB2047F9391BA
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
0xF1013420F0F6B34EA7E0857499923EDA
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
0x763CFCC61EEBE48E9FBBABDC965CBBDD
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
0x2F113472C0DF5F9DF25F8535DF34872E
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
0x6070EFB37CE560FF5F5105CA3C384F0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele here came running up again.
0x2A766C112686D8012930ACDD25111C44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
0xFD7592526E84F579ABF4F717FF3CE9EB
wishes to see you."
0x4C4D8733C0E40E4B444E8C24E85E7BED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
0x80DD5A91EB13328347E083445BEBA2FD
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
0xCE0F3DDD664462F6B516AC6E82EF21C7
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
0x2DE732717C069E6B37428BE00387E426
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
0xB2A5FE5A3333FC63373E636382FB782A
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
0xBCAECCD3F5627E09251DE30CAA9D19B3
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
0x3D21FF21B7F5F40564BA3BEB0FDBCF85
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
0x9B997E84779FFEB86308B5286F968697
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
0xE7ECA33CD2A85271EAF10C88D87D2938
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
0x29B86A5317D550A253F0DF959C3E28B9
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
0x2A9C6DC086F87B5FACA62C9E69DF88C2
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
0xBC1D59BED8E0A0E4C2BF87D8087748D8
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
0x36249259E530844E6135D2A41FF5F4A7
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
0x134332DCBE4ED798C3BB74C9EFCFF551
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
0x4F464182EA93F71F8DD83309B90FCDDC
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
0x63167134DE39ECD0046394B92757028A
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
0x02DD5C7D02E50096BAFC4EB2D5E10C30
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
0x6562C3B4C397C15D9172C31E763A014B
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
0x3A9C5296DFF1FA2296433D0BD4D7953A
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
0xD5D3413971E0684BB194E4A38EEDC550
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
0x70DA92939A118756F7E374BCA4A30C9F
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
0xF98A52584491FDC9C76E5214A064B096
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
0xA57F1A90FABE8AA6AD71608D7A5D29E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
0x3737D9B1460F73E01EBCAA3280B1F3F4
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
0x086538A58301AEEED1214C1C8DCEC108
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
0x3BD0BE56C3050A191E48E3DB387765CE
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
0xEE11D05B7374E6CBC6D7B17340E8104E
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
0xCEB3EE5A26EA2AE421353F1330C72247
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
0x96BEF50166056C9FBC0CA4714EE9940F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
0xA36D096324797852CEC0789ED9E09959
you too: it darkens."
0x1515A3D6EE89D6398FB9B1F8FCDDD575

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
0xCBA66CA95F1148F7A76E196A0999ECCF
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
0x17F16D1613F17D50768E6B1CC6338A1C
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
0x558810613F86BB46C0BED97F67F7EF30
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
0x142E8B70C46D6F190734CC578ED696C3
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
0x58CDA1412DE373DC84F8E775AC072D67
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
0xE314E8578C6A0F03AF147E89467AAEBC
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
0xB63B17E1F922EDD19225EEEF2D4FAACC
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
0x932790B53D1B325B60DAE4AFA000E7C5
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
0xE8974D300BF23A246C1918D0D6C2332C
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
0xA86F9FB1B1542A6CE0FD3AC911E2BF8A
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
0xD9E6B7138EC6B2ADF402958D4B864270
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
0x1957CE848A1FAC19015E2776BB2AFFF9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
0x1067872DF9331C5A570BA39DD069D406
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
0xB85AA1F286C045D826DCE092F3B433F5
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
0x4EBECD8C62D2F9816C1A76C60DC011F5
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
0xC1278A9882791A1752914B15306416B7
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
0xA7FF599DF3841A05B4B027FEF9F8DCA5
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
0x7E5D50D261C2E95C5EC24045B7635786
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
0x47E7ED67A4D01A399950C0175C0B9B7F
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
0x92EC39C37C0DA45D88DD87FCC627BDB6
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
0xB7BBFA867D910B9C1A57FE987148DE17
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
0x34EF9F8B28C4D1A7A65346FFE2A5C60B
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
0x9070932D290E3C0958184A40E0D3153B
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
0xD086A65740D5EF3795B8201794ED213C
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
0xC8AA3D366D0559A7B4AA15038C6DDF85
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
0x1C2209B8ED3B7A6D8E0EFCE8128E2F27
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
0x70C16E72797061D0A18FBB15D8E130D5
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
0x33049F8E815FE70C258996EEDCECCCC8
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
0xDED7370EA30191C47D13C052E40018C2
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
0x46696BA2E7C5807AABCC60A10605BB5B
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
0x1954800E39D95E096357CA053A0BB208
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
0xB6C36304523E9860A11209073723F7FF
benefit.
0x177BA87E790F472F97D3F34FD10BD6EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
0x23156CC75065A56442702B8BE57300B1
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
0x66D7807D79462C68FE495E4B731DCCF5
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
0x2BDE22EACF3D92E9EE180E578F08CF01
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
0x025672F0AC4DEEE6B369774D2069B2F6
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
0x4101346F5C2570B7D04C400082ECB41C
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
0x4F8AA099A6F80999472F4A5A5EE83A1F
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
0x2D5F8CAEA9E6A3D6292754B0091E79A0
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
0xC5498C93306A3BB5F6AE341D5A06DF72
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
0x182CAA6C0A1342794C858F278F33F5F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
0x9152C829EC2E3A42FDA89A9519B61102
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
0x9E4CB8C30C68613391BC1F7F68E93EC9
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
0x975AD93937C74056D7F28CC773AE68C9
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
0x566185487E51CDEB74EAEE879E6951F9
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
0xE211085AB52D01E840C38FC0F33746AD
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
0x073EA47974B7404ECC1D670F101EF152
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
0x49CBF16883F0EAA65260C2CE92B9E500
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
0x338B708ED2EC92E74595F2C5CACABF46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
0x38FE45D9903E03409FBFF5B6916EF937
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
0x79F88C3B276F94275CFEAF5039F0B392
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
0x956DF7CC7082A750BA6F620105BFD14B
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
0x1E9AF20D74A124EA1B2657CDEA79C196
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
0x36053C91AEEF49FAAFC53B3E953226AD
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
0x88269747D829D8B83B20199D8322372B
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
0x8D23EC53E57E6BD087ADE39CB5ACE553
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
0x66AD8346EB4DCC6C3333AD2DE34369B8
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
0xE1AA2D7A5985185856DE2B91553715DC
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
0xD45770B33E2A2D0CD23401E899C3518D
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
0xDD63C56ACCAB99E434754A1518371E49
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
0x562035C273D45F47CA21CE1EE1B2CE7F
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
0xACAF9734C0ABB597F90A144FABEC4FF1
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
0x199D40BEA9B307C4BACC04CCFDAA5D75
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
0x5FB756C932CE323C771E80D9B596B94C
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
0xAE30617DB064B099479FD0E4DA10E665
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
0x03097BADCDDD1B7BE7FEC0DEF3DE0A7C
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
0x71D0192F39C86A8A40E5CFFA7065B466
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
0xE738403F0BB085098130C48BCD5D42FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
0xF0EC191D6DF6E6877610DC5FB0392C2E
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
0x9382A4E4E0AE7A00A9153C2FFEE93BC9
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
0x4909E20334B10659EC97A073C23F7936
Thornfield.
0x7B03AA125E1684AA84CE1DFA07C95427

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
0x725C20CD31B1487029AF3C33A25190BC
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
0xE64BC2413097D9D85520741D777066F7
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
0x6E4037FB199B555F5A973BB520D17921
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
0xB15E9CB8147DAC104B3013EF5AE31AE7
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
0x6DD9D69DCEC7FBD7FC916BFAC361C7F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
0xA716510238805FBC3A560FE9F7F41073
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
0x67A29A865DE1FC68BB2EF5B264C30A3E
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
0xC1AED8E052D5DA83768B629F93961F7A
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
0x1F1EDEAE3D245AF9FDB0FEF984DFF23F
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
0xD5EE014856AD6D1553D6DBFC7CE31745

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
0xB35EF57A6B215373857B73991BD82F28
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
0x2AA5D0B5D75D73BEFCC26D975AB8C8EA
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
0x9EB06A78B7F5C1192054FFA27CFDBC50
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
0xEC222B6279FA298D6E7F3613C76BE099
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
0x59C323675570042FA7D5041D28D502A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
0x705CB1DC026A3CBAFC855A021FEAEA17
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
0x3724CC0A891C68D4CD021BB8F5F2CF23
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
0x8BA03CAA10F0A49318AA7592FDF933AB
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
0xA670292618DC82DEC20EC55BDBE18C0E
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
0xDD03BEDDC8D55023A36DE29F25A604F0
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
0xF6210DDD228386BF8F573E85D6C8CC23
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
0x0642572D58677F4BE781F6C5F804A051
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
0x4636FD1AA3AAB62FF9C2ECB14E1F57E6
enough.
0xBD7C4928BD7C4928E3F3258E87CC9FB5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
0xC44EF4074927E4BD53400B4897AF1C84
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
0xE5A1DDDA1FF88154567EB27F13B7CF22
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
0x71ED493307776783C7851018B631791B
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
0xE2F5C1F9F59EE4E64D028FDDCE5D600C
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
0xD8C208C6CC84667673012D884638EFEB
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
0x975F29DE0CDD8D6410F8108E4838BEC8
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
0xD474E231C4E468DCE5DBCF29AABCF71D
there?"
0x817268938172689381142D1A7060A828

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
0x70188E3E22AE98EEB63B9C10DFE21AB7
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
0x0CF0C23259237AC224FFCBEB3778FF36
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
0x62E9BE7243A246474AC689CB05E6E047

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
0x38B5F42157378C56C0392B17229A763E
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
0x107E5237D79685AB838F690F7881D6DD
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
0x20B13E4D6C0BEC9BFAC17ECCCC589560
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
0x0616F5CDC51938153F780BF2C9DB0249
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
0x86C9F4EB43B1810A1F6255B256ED185E
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
0xEA664CB16A736BB0065D9B2F6E8B2128
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
0x546442F1D1B28EC2C0A162317652790D
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
0x6EE96961F120E612C50BD5F197011553
burning.
0xBFFFA7190D2B12B0338DCB639282C8DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
0xD204F0C99D64C8F3F310EF79477D6890
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
0x85F0390890FE94805A5266074B21856F
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
0x6C2A0FC3E20B6A453B9D92CC412A779D
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
0x9220872330E57534A3B145AE5879C44E
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
0xAA10EF0FF151BD8E2F7EDD20AF83CC53
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
0x0B4A39FD83D2E06199F28BCE75263B41

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
0x3AEAC4982D9C0249E5CCBBE7017D25C5
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
0xDC08F4893D7739DFFE2358181278FF90
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
0xF56212945440F7F6A8E37B53E13FA4A6
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
0x21514E2C1816EB069612BB42D592E016
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
0xAFF56ECC5B9E9A609438686E75B1CC93
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
0x437A83CB2E27A7AE8F1FE0AF0C798663
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
0x0BA77EF5C1D8B4286FB4F4FD41B94061

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
0x7C06FD01705DDC6E9F0270D4FA1BFB1D
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
0xD93F7F0BC034942A916CC63EF6608016
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
0xCCA53EDFBEA7EE68A070A888642521B5
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
0xC58AFEC2408A0C7A31591846F0A6BB58
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
0x889A2E621E909053FBFBCEE531FA2281
water.
0x25611883256118838639253BD67C6B09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
0x59F9EAC768E7D1BA6762B95F3D315595

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
0x71F7EEFE4AB7969F45B87853900BCE3B
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
0x66D2F6B57C11F69F4199CF5EB0FAEB5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
0xE61FFAABD4D7D181E0AA164E7D986884
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
0x6F6CE2C5DE73BA58838D8EA0E7EDA56E
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
0xE37D347062078E4371B1BE15DCB0C460

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
0x1F82F2F81FAED5C9572E3D91B6A63089
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
0x02AD3A2497A9E236A7354A3E3FB7D0B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
0x388CAE732717A908C5C8ED77FFF43A0F
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
0x3AEC04EC333F61D53964A1BB11FFC9B6
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
0x0BCAFF08D5145D81D5B8B2250EE097E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
0x2DE44DDBF3979F59A8448F773AEAE690
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
0x6B8BD85B6289C3F2008A743DC3618F49
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
0xCDBF7CDE9CDEA610A04D700393DAD8F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
0xD0A8C457D502D63801252FAF60690D77
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
0x07ACE22E9DB443EC591B475BC49744B1
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
0xDD3654678883979FA5A1DA94863F67B3
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
0x20A8D6FB5D1D2EB8A480BBA2DD52353C
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
0xA00E405B006EC49CFA051B34EB836C44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
0xEDE26DFB9A9DB3D5BF35E1BED108CE51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
0xFDBC100EB7DE6A1B41ED610A31BCC53E
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
0xCF386D09BA213852ED67D294E734818A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
0x966860219CCF7F3A8D387FF9656B8F34

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
0xA8E12A917F818E9F40FD068100C09F50
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
0x56500960F664138A0C4C04B589F380B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
0xFE4CA664B0C8146A22AE56D0B6622E4B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
0xFCACF96EED87DAB85DBC7A1545B1405C
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
0x53F77DCB8E9806B6C89E3FFE88F71289
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
0xE26D1F2696F5CF56E42DF9B0713BC8C5
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
0xB17A91883A941B061F3297353C8ABC6B
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
0xFFE4783B6D79367F478DA9B40D183398
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
0x6AA362EE253EB684D7AD2356608B3141
move, remember, or call any one."
0x6D17E053F558441523A9B69DAD77AE8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
0x23AFBD24430D37509A2CECD6AE53FC10
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
0x0363B5306121A8EDCD3F09FDF4DFA3DF
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
0x5AF0FE2018718ACAB48524B17DACCC27
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
0xF9F81F0B532847C63103FCF032C03E20
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
0x325D54DBA3DB28AB3A0FA1E013577A52
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
0x5A32FA22D7FF883913438CE446EFD0C8
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
0xF2817ADBEA111EBF5F0ECECBFEBA67D5
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
0x2360F442C8B95643A2A524473A3B4BBE
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
0x69AC0904B5ACF2A420553546499A4ABE
"and not something worse."
0x26DEC5FE984CE1A7AB417D1B195D488E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
0x89B734919BCAD977CA70798BDB0D8EA7
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
0x31CFB7601177F32271367EC2E1D0EA6F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How, sir?"
0xC8E888E2803F1E50D7F575F4D5AE92A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
0xAD19C796A051EF35CC913721114E287E
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
0xB2B21A484AF4A21752D68F879FE1B4A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
0xAE7D84F5B98DE844EC8707CD761A40CF
door."
0xF9346BB5F9346BB53FE5F96F58A8BE78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
0xBFF13CD437333B9050ED849269223B81

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
0xD9A8D17D1640B49832FF4F78F2ABACBB
think, or something like it?"
0x3768FD32F7C1037CFE95D801C31DE613

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
0x1D7BC8FEDFAC80F687B89E35069DC244
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
0xB21B1CB0206823520AADF0966652458C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
0x87B7B600F6A6D5DB38D95C32BF1CDA34
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
0xCDDD67F3985BB1B2010414953ABB2CB1
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
0xD892D890F33CEC5CDEEACF36049EFA65
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
0xDAC37B6354A2744BD99B80EB13015720
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
0x859A4E54DA360BD612C117AA544D6D3C
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
0x5C37B60E7346ECD28F99F3184E84B12D
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
0x862A2B9193EF6285A32F6F77F34A5B27
hours the servants will be up."
0xD217F8A913B141652CD5C3A3229738A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
0x045765B403CCF220093859EDAC1E185A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
0xA775B4265639D070EFA2EAAB58828194
go.
0x66FDB3AC66FDB3AC66FDB3AC475A68A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
0xF3384395E5A16BF93FECD86821351531

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You said I might go, sir."
0xFF24A4A6DB40F9AC1CF83A1E81356C72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
0x7BCCCC7E8C5305E8AD23BC9B8877F4E7
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
0xC8264A7E01BFC1A31B86A18CB4A37EF4
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
0xD3BFA578AB1006A184260B174D583E94
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
0xE935DB9CD6FFBCB2D661EB9C41FD5D12
At least shake hands."
0xFA61CD4A5A2FBC95CAAFD6F58A82C9A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
0xD8690517AB5D565B083D591EE68F83BD
both his own.
0xDCCD8A0ED85B82EED6DB9423AFA05AA3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
0xCC8B4D3BFE834F86BEA58365C0084846
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
0x70F740EC9CAB79449DD7C67A7FCB4DA5
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
0xF5A51263E5569F16D7765DECFD080096
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
0xBF4C5C0EE29C27F56E86B302EA99786C
his voice was checked.
0x7A0A1EF09FDD8E185491DDEE3EC28543

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
0xC78AD04FEDA4CBA9374DD3C971F87DE3
in the case."
0xA434F0B72A355E54E9EB15A10744F49B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
0x7FF1517355610B001C059AA65654622A
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
0xB11A6C0D46B89136005DD7AD800C0C78
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
0x965052042AF68EB28096E5EDB491A5DA
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
0xA9F962A020F7DA6DE9630AE24DE56AAF
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
0x369C30721FA8549303D7EE769B58BC25
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
0x6B4B5FEF8CAFC0DDA6B983E965EE814C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am cold, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
0x209EBCD202EB09695116A1A8FF5E0985
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
0x52BB6E6CBCA444F1B3CE343F2FC9D71E
expedient.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
0xC9A756319D98297AA9832DCB0979B0E5
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
0xD92B902EB565613C34DCCFE5D885E14F
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
0xEDCF73DA9CD17DC53A802387FDBAD3A9
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
0x8E015199D74756D056ED7EE05AFA0D0B
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
0xC423624A3B5DB2503728675E935DFA63
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
0x981075365FD20B3D1AECD812A979478C
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
0x5B86ACFDC574466F5CA57F167AA596D3
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.

CHAPTER XVI
0x107304830C6DF9CD9BEC6B293A7CC11F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
0x4EE44B3C30D62B4124A2E56D7A09762D
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
0xA4629BA10CA824440A637A831687964D
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
0x03B48FF7E10D3F396C791A003A25541E
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
0x2FC58433DA411382BE4A1673F92D2680
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
0xA8FFC08633AB11F9B958C8F3CB20AF07
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
0xF90326A4DBFF2253EF53D45D4E729978

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
0xEFDBF570E0C71FF3E52F6034801221F2
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
0xEC65C19F047E0AD4751F56780C4F9829
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
0xB50B971374FB26095873DA6820CE1BCA
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
0x59B0E03C9154B919F5D341C95804ADBA
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
0x3B225C340DA378A64D348057589F6120
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
0x74E9C0C7B1A7272E92C830C6BC2224A1
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
0xA06EE8716CDF46083B673D070AD2C362
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
0x88D9A0FF9B3AF872D8CBA491652D1223
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
0xB55AFCAB428DD616E7331D1D39BEF8BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
0x3B07D17F4D93ED172BFF4436DEAA60A3
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
0x3D578CE5D804A455786388E5429FCB5A
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
0xB2446631848C0063CA9B35B662005713
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
0xED6EA0190E58E84295BEDC6C30266FC0
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
0x9212F43177D11E99A1757426786D6245
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
0x8662F80A9EDABCFCCF295FEE01F5E9CD
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
0xBFEBAAED3C95CB920622717BD892C999
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
0xCB9B5D39AFF3DC37B677CA513BA4889D
no other than Grace Poole.
0xD1D1CA3B8A8E3FDB85CDDE320EB04AA7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
0xE13E7FE7034922AA3FDFFFD8C4B26C1A
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
0xB100314C52A456B1D186D90DEBABAC29
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
0xC1DCEC2A9E1CF76E95AB89D2F25C3A85
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
0x41E967C293EB7FB2A6B47B0AB9B0A987
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
0x57F0F48D75915BC3DE04C397BE74E385
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
0x6340CEAF1BB96214BB0E3FA8A29B21F7
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
0x89E859C18DDDC6D7EBE9995EBB90ADBC
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
0x4807E8EC253AECF624286C8C5F558F12
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
0x717716D71D646D55CEFF482302714FF0
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
0x615AD164CF9E3C156769E4A970C41570
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
0xF9B2E83F8314421AAB43B740B588A83B
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
0x1B65BC9E1899F7BD7D3C932C2E05E200
went on with her sewing.
0x3EDBBA3FA51D9AC52C9A55CAF8339060

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
0x8E3F24CB04619E1F7B774D5A06E11565
is past comprehension."
0x14CC886CE32B6F5C12FBA08ABF66C1DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
0xFC29F7C2174FF3A81096572979BF37AA
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
0x6FE8E5CC87AD50E25730B5182F5B5D09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
0xF2592CCA594EF452F0028462FD8878BA
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
0xDB5FE44BF635FA8E6B085236EE0F191F
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
0xE5ECB2C4E8CC96397E07F10DCEA958C6
the flames with the water in the ewer."
0xF5D7426B4868C1B83C3F8DF316083E53

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
0x388EEDF301B711DA5C54D863C6DD3B15
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
0x55EF1922B73555CF5D67A2851E8743DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
0x0DC2E3EBD031B451312366C62342F9FF
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
0x0B1AB3F9745D460A1FF311B364647CC1
she answered--
0x5BF5869A87A81D2020C6A83A6C0D2500

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
0x07438F6B66FF31CB7964982191C358E7
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
0xAF8CB98FF19AB0BC3D3EE18416B423DC
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
0x8E420BA461B671261B6DA4046DD1E50C
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
0xB6C00CA88F5877AA40E8E149789BDC7E
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
0x9CCDE1FB1DC1C097FFAEAC26DA936E86
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
0xDCE118C41ECAAF8E35193C494FBD31D2
a noise?"
0xAF905D09389E29F4E959EB4B588E562A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
0x74EC536747EAB53E7080A6B74D6F4D5F
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
0x8CDA56ECD36AF2B59AFCEAB57AFEAB6C
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
0xEDC35CB02833D69AE9C11D4FB77D08E5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
0x66E26BC45732ACA59FEF18B6E34024E3
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
0x284FAB5144B56DA58A8A3762E01EC460

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
0x5A2308F902DA91287860BAF6171BF88F
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
0xA99AC0598F766CC6A5973A6638EA80AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
0xDD09AC460F1F50CDDAD5D70C3ECF3464
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
0xC8B33811593684534B29C60B1EC53BD4
conscious eye.
0x5423F590180168F357861EA13B49BD09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
0xA0F39E9E1973E87B57C75EA06FE87EAC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
0xDF8057B6C81820525A72F144FB0581CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
0xA58AA45E39168E5797F2AA459465634F
gallery?" she further asked.
0x8DFE52A303EA00B6B5E6867B60D73F2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
0xAF1284B216963F6219A7E2BB8C12BFC9
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
0xE673B5D954136F0472758DA713D8D5C1
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
0x8EEA21763E90CD6AF6C742F54D93EB8B
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
0xF39603AAF30AF989678559BFD66AACFC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
0xA6658DE79E8078968524008FDD9ADA52

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
0x12D1F8E1C62DD3C227974AAC69888978
you get into bed?"
0xA34106BF01A7391D23FD98F839A2F491

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
0x93571CA3276BDF694367072667146CDB
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
0x695C73E16D8C186566AA891B49723C8C
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
0x8D1CD90245B20F12612B008631C763FF
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
0x5DF9C6F6D449DE5743C49D941B74853E
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
0xF58ACD2CD9E972E3136D32FD2FF8DFDE
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
0x375A05B34EF741AEF9A530B201D90BCF
lie down."
0x08095CD9D02A68ABC0D471680A403CE6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
0xA8D12A3F25CB854182BC6F5A9FAE98E1
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
0xC717ACF528B5AC1AE3125F6A63A1D9BE
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
0x3627322E22EBB8D4B6C27FE259E473A3
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
0xEBF0553A4DBA9124EEDF67D02F04A321
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
0x39D38CF8B768C1F4C8227D3632AA2A5D
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
0xB7BB2442EE637E7796FC6DCEC9EBAAE2
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
0x2CFF47637889DE11D5F562507B0FA88E
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
0x7B4FCA92AB71D9073628C354682A78C3
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
0x1955D75589B4B56C8BF36E1CAEBCC102
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
0x448EF955D4D0106066A0689CD8FBFD79
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
0x7548468EF2C5DDDD56EBC8F88C6BF704
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
0x3B152F59DDBCBB6A502063DD8B573BDD
demureness of a Quakeress.
0x4C5599B78379ADF43121E85773B90884

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
0x385F197459613287E2EE01420014FD60
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
0x3550FACB6DF122EACB0D2B2657622535
entered.
0xE65794449B5437D6EC01560044291FBA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
0x856BCA9AF5334530915F3B17A19A0E57
be ready: will you come down?"
0x2A873977AD91E095748C1C1D3E09C8EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
0x9167DF822BF8EDA58E0CA4BB78689C5A
carry it upstairs."
0xC0E6550672CD1FC7CBDC9B4056F2CA40

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You'll have some meat?"
0xB59443873622F63FE305364ADF53736E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
0x2590785A238F0E952A63F6CE18CA9309

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And the sago?"
0xBAC05CDC9E4409982C1480D0A27B08E3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
0x983F48B465658394B058F2C6687D683B
make it myself."
0xC51AB0EA667D098312DB56D763A939A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
0xB91F7E8C50E9A508DC5998C6DA85976E
so I departed.
0x72E7B524899858E61FAA8F741161C8EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
0x04CAE7986E405DBFDEB338ACF3CE8A6A
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
0x879DB8FC4D2C214F43915CDF2B053B79
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
0x7F27B078E20BEB40D1F97D1D9CFB6CBD
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
0x107BA29815480846C9FC8263688FD241
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
0x7A875AB5D3CBE011A4D5192A10270E7A
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
0x7EF972C6058DA66875606CBB34DCD1A1
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
0x072483CDFE8A35811308D44F70638AA9
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
0x5AD8D6DAD8C0107D68BAD9217DAD4AB5
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
0xAC1EEAE488DB7984D4FCCEB3FD336D39
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
0xFF38798A089D57724BF2A171F07105A0
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
0x3AA40E50E112EE432BB1387DE8480312
attempt, much less punish her for it.
0x5FD58A3A2A0CA64D9605CAFFA46C031A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
0xC52050D3DB2D0A8EAFC806F7ECDC93B2
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
0xC706B3BA77204D60C02CCC92A6276402
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
0xF30EE689846D92CE746BB9307B3A3569
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
0xD075BDAD35685CE18BFD34B585506C4D
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
0xB8981A9F58F19D412B0531E2E6CA90F7
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
0x807621C20DB4923D2A2BAD5EE39F7A55
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
0xDD6DF0E5D8DFC4D664DCDDE33B47D5B5
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
0x2B3252CB0DA136653E4845D9D9D8EB08
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
0x391B1BBAC2B83869B067A8CF66D7195A
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
0x3FC64D64DFE2906E96845E38AC38AF72
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
0x96C4994121433F0F77780DCFFC712C2C
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
0xB5B839664764265747FCB39E8E4BB027
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
0x8A68E0702829FFE07FDB1D691D5C1C44
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
0x614E1750F1589C0059365019B9D7AF66
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
0x16E2CD882DB09DEEC98C5EE078009FC2
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
0x766517093698F87FC142FD11660DDD7B
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
0x98890DC1796D20ABE542C2155B40A75C
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
0xA88954E97E9A700061185D81407E78BE
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
0x4EFBE13D67C951BF7F555B0F66F5B8A3
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
0x303742F635074E277A98B436005A0ACC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
0x15E2029EC232380F31393E8266750271
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
0x6094F6D5EE359E887251DB53CA467574
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
0x7B40A85D9F38FF83219874A909F82B68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
0x0217865EC6FD6D84F46334CAC70BC93A
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
0xA06FEF023B8822F1E5089A9D5CFF10C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
0xE2E080886F26D19208F6223C7D48AD16
thinking.
0x3CC668DFF0C497D349B340125F9FD36C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
0x0C4CF5FD623E0CAD82DEB57010714E26
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
0xE07EEF85D1842A74611131913541245E
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
0xA648B875B887825D2E24B2A5E056B4F3
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
0x393064E31D2BA8941DC15DF35811AD13
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
0x5402BFD72BF8F16A19F87B09EDAE2347
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
0x6834CD5CAF39A5FE78FE3A5958BFEB36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
0x4BF02557DB3D171DBD413C451D80DABB
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
0x469C31B1E6294297D3EE2D51A768D78C
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
0x81A61EC883A0A6962ECE51919DC04EB5
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
0x30850B3A9AAA90C2B081A09BA8164E6F
impatient."
0x46703A76DC896A1B1F8AB062FB4DC5CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
0x5BB314BF0180AF7960590ADD0133A49D
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
0xE3946B5972E1D6861D2A4FD8C78E447E
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
0x4069AF0C5660FDE9AE722A93E1341393
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
0xBC4269AC96DEED158365D932E7398DCA
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
0x5D157475913F05F0812D10D2E37DD9FE
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
0x8D74BA650D6498AA2505B525650985C7
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
0x516BBCA3290E4258193419CF48A08B9A
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
0x093E53A2F7386BFCF2D179F0B5348CA7
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
0x03561D747959A4ECD5A2759881C9400C
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
0x65EAD7981E4A5CFC06E1B2B316759D28
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
0x913E2C63CC3EC839D708FA6728B658CE
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
0x617D5ADEBB554D69E76250F0E251AF8F
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
0xB144D8E6A49EC16A53CEFACD718E9465
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
0xD5A5FD629B2F3EE6FE4A3B9623AE3DEB
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
0xB961F2433ED72561F3CAF6A42889B803
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
0xF794371689C0F332E46AE3E919826437
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
0x6F2F91B33F78B008FBF60FD40C23ABA8
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
0x552AEA143BEC06F3A373A3060E275674
restraint; this suited both him and me.
0x64822BA318E1687041117FB435E01181

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
0x3AA607036650C1FFBD5DDB1EFCA84B34
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
0x3E90163A67DB65599ED011134DB90383
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
0x10DCF60E87EDD62310FD6B14E2F8DB74
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
0xD1529A2805669D5E9CC4843256B2883C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
0xF9D6AADDC84726A271C2AB36128AA96A
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
0xE16B84D259FCFE80392CCAB8554EBE59
day: you look flushed and feverish."
0x6663F2C817D950C65D8FB8424D13BCBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
0x4DE95F16E20626F451EF08D5729960DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
0xB3B73E1EC23EE76B812A2132CFADA0F9
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
0x1FAE1B6A4884F2894127E08A45632408
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
0x46881A0734F2798670FE4E1005DFDE93
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
0x620BE9CDDC789FB661934254D025B3E9
deepening into total obscurity.
0x8B99D72D99B6053DB5194CB56C0A5F90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
0x70068CB76E3CD4B78986BA9A099FAE7A
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
0x3CA4BD1900EB8082D0D8343466F4893C
his journey."
0x7859972F8EC147C1C7529EEA21ABA2AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
0x77BAA8FFD179B83A31B55B19F7148FD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
0x0BEF8820148809CE526C6942433B83E4
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
0xD9ECDAB2A8F21B69A611071BC5DB24E0
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
0xB5B583FD958FE633CF7E105E00BE7E2F
Colonel Dent, and others."
0x609D87BA5591712FC6EB976CB044AA26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
0x78A57BB33BF422DADEFEF287FAEF84ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
0xE1EE889DED93CB32021E0B187742E62E
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
0x1405C96BE22DF960A4CEE0FCFC1BFE86
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
0x06FF305826828A6216FC3620C4853616
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
0xAFB9A1EA6122495B50D71141F33AD68D
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
0x4C66A3083C86B4DFDB4D65604FB9B27D
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
0x9C549CE71B57E4A2442DCE93B21F4A0F
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
0xF8E3657D2CA1397F42157B212109C757
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
0x3DCB25A61E732A3F2C5C9B38EF2C4F60
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
0x4DF67B32D6018A8CDBD89963F71B8B66
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
0xC7B184DB4BFA75DBFC4E531F266424A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
0x42DDA3F2661A8315CC50C087B412E06D
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
0x712D22F50BAF1BA9A0371143FD562449
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
0x6647BE2C0DE92ECF824AAD6CF81BDC32
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
0xBFFE393141F8F898BFC7D43D0C40E252
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
0xB57B7928D45716D94925A762EF63FA2A
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
0x4EE99D977D0E75AD7B6D9B59B164CE50
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
0x8C0064D7ABE7C1F7B67FFD2CC90230A9
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
0xC1604C2EF9EC4456519581ACEC6C3A71
the evening."
0xC7C4900BE9B1B03DE475076D51EFE215

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
0x4362154F7F6BBBE8551E06EA88D417A6
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
0x97D1484BFBB5C14AFE80A6D6D128D688
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
0x006A0A8A0684D31D78D8ACC0B7097DE9
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
0x549051FE7DB4BF3154FB2A48A9D26084
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
0x39DEFD76FD25DD9D1D47840547A3FC9A
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
0x5CE32C9023D32F9F13168B6B22AE7EFD
was certainly the queen."
0x512F063BC5445C8E0F208EA613AD00E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
0xB2287FE191712D9FEB940DBF170FBD99
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
0x1B04EB9C3888D3533B3D8CEE965F8F03
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
0x926F9B220B9978B6C2D53F3A6BD60609
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
0x16AC4C7C51DBB3E02E6FD4F2E634557A
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
0x503727F44C20E599BCFC66014F814EFB
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
0xFCA0DD3C9CEAEA9EBAAA40CE4814C542
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
0x1E90F33887E5031F0603C64A43CF78F1
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
0x1569A0A1C9F4549212C0810AE5F4B7AC
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
0x00551BBA719679F5A42351845A5F8406
jetty mass of her curls."
0x6DC99809DE9A8914DC235C12C81727C4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
0xDD5E07311C54F5DA3B7F49855B538263
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
0x359CB4DFA1D10F6C8AF19C2334DF363E
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to

listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
0x9B0421581FE0FF59EB7C9A3D98BD34B9
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."

"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large

fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the

0x4426491592EE399C295C247AB79DCE65
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
0x874BE319A704F6A9E5B5F3226AE9D67D
conversation was turned into another channel.
0x82C1D3C135921BCCD5B84378C868870B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
0x37461A28A324C4EFF0F7E9D3B7F6C348
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
0xB83C67C4CAF7292DCD787EABCD47E8FC
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
0x14174D41C374F35744BE047BA88CD1BF
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
0xDB282211C5BD7A2C23FDCAC9E8B2BB72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
0x1E988F4B62DAC5DDCDED9860B1B79F3A
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
0xD868932EBF385B5BC965CF4CC47E956B
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
0x2BDDDAC3E0BDC8800CFDD6355F25BB87
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
0xA7A9B088AB531359515A8F404D969F1F
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
0x0134B3039A9C1B40F4EA0BA4BE3D2DD4
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
0x6D9C4662113BF3FD12D717DB7FD3E8C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
0x71A48CF8F96B3F3FCAD54562056B7F9F
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
0xBF307577D4610F23B9514316D14E6A39
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
0xA0B3A36CFE88CF16877B1591638AEF92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
0xC3A26CB438161EC506EB538498B00DF7
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
0x804D9EE14C715B98105CC4C8A2E0C023
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
0xFF995C3691169FE79410A4D8043A7F5E
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
0x0E11CF8DDC340CA01EEBDBB8756CB9F9
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
0x205606A8D28DC5D62F9BF8CAB3B5C687
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
0x378B0368355BF41D718BCA60867D8521
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
0x32CCD91C29DF61A9DA942508D5F38E02
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
0x8297B0227A49675F4EC46FABAAC3C009
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
0x976F923D46B39AC71D633859C6121449
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
0xB9301D05E20F07E3319C49050B71ED4D
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
0x35CF903B6FE35C6F281164B8D53524F9
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
0x9A50424274DED0AA7DC4C5778FAB80C0
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
0x068FD743DB0538B029332FBD6204C6EF
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
0x3C8165B2D7C7C741BE26976AB11E77CC
is no extrication.
0xC731858F0B54CDE018ABCBB2D6A33508

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
0x031BBBAC6971C4CF99B9122DBDACDCFE
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
0xE3FBC833A6AF1B6B77697F6E68FBF939
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
0xD883F1412ABC82DF3901D179E2D4D5E0
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
0x8E664A2C9C1C158D9AF10178F50E2BCC
poor, and plain.'

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
0x1E34A5004F29449ADE4B28FE393D5494
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
0xE6785ED240C69A7CEAF4F8556112ED96
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
0x4664C0F74653D609EBAB2912CCF307A1
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
0xAE6E9B0DC12BEF60EFE75AA054158F45
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
0x23BFADB1953EBB70B06E59C641CBD7EE
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
0xBCD4BE58F30B2A6A6A635C505BDF1B31
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
0xE8E8D924E378236EED0811227A0A7D9C
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
0xC96F032ABE83250CD32A4CDDE108B138
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
0x440AF43DA299A4D8F6349F6C0BDC1C94
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
0x2AB6E1EC4AC4E35EC60CDA4F5C17D722
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
0x9182B6D5FF839F65E376DDC8FE36C662
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
0xD918BE1875DEE32EC4D46C9D9E4D6201
accomplished lady of rank.'
0x6FFFE886786197CF7810241BE76DD89E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
0xDDABD78CB4DA27A1CE5FD30A4882A4C0
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
0x323AA9936DD696B08B3C4C646BEC01F3
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
0x2D78C28563881E58B4143BD71942C0B8
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
0x583B051A5C5FB383D388EB98154F2312
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
0x9D6F4783B882C4720D85CD4BCDAEA3E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
0x93064E4CB6C1E2B6A4AB070AAC77CCAD
calm, and fell asleep.
0x4B5F96A836EEB1B429F20C5609D10602

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
0x43ED02967BD51F209F9CCABA113807E3
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
0xBAF85E691D373089A630435C534E60A1
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
0x56C55D44D6FA3B2F6E37E27E12003E43
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
0x7EF6E7956174D0138C3D0C7881C7D5FB
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
0x8E8BCA6BE01990CA31133EC7A333AA6A
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
0x5DC1D09C3A9E6F3D01BD59CA5600F360
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
0x361CB668426F39781FC275C44317462E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
0x32293AD5E396F38B566B8BA51E01C1B5
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
0x1D6F8413AD40D872AE71AD0E2AF551D3
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
0xF84BE3C0BB8A064F3D4B6182F8D3F459
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
0x4CB33342DBF183F21ACB68EDC8109C1E
maintain, even externally.

CHAPTER XVII
0x89063F6D081B28F7BEC2A05578DA916F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
0xFC349B9B7996C7A8F923C7D4EA2F6950
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
0x29D7FA489B748F84F75218DF22D06A4F
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
0xDB2DF6BE418A255922816546A25277DB
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
0x4B9BF262DCA78975C1A23AB39EC5C097
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
0xC87C7175C9D395F901F00E3690843994
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
0xB4F910CB9F8CA32785DE2F0C1BFACAE6
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
0xE804CDAE6C2B637E8C404EF6270A191C
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
0xCF692D2154AE00C1EB262815A47F6675
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
0xFD1417BD1B5DB1F3FF50733D9DAA629B
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
0xB9C8BA929F98C61B1B73C0EAF359C972
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
0xF81F1F7C81F29DB8A3A68E83B238D297
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
0x984E45F64ABCD03F84077D21488EEBC3
on the contrary, I just said--
0x6D356B720DE49530858EDA8791632051

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
0x37119402181DACF54D11365B8D596D2F
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
0x17354747B7026FB4D7304F7808D309E5
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
0xEE4770092B9F8D1D2858DE76644DC9F2
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
0x9E640901738689B75550FB84B2B2B883
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
0xE7D93F1EFDCD6058EB22524574929262
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
0x02B8451ADEA7FA915B33EBC34203D3D2
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
0xD0DD0ED0D224C20372247C1C6F221F90
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
0x8E45C3303AAADD6BAEA084AE78F31A9D
wanted and would be despised."
0x8BDBF9F4E21A4F705A8395DA3B95E849

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
0x2B1CE18AB31363798947E59CF897C878
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
0x75585F08E827BDAFE77B9DBEF978C29F
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
0x057236D893CFBD1E96229CCAC50BC1D6
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
0x1C941C816E08D66CA6C8427D09608165
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
0x21A9346646482025A0366D3B5A3728E5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
0x4457148B1F83649913F2FEC42801E778
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
0xB5E5E4C792DE7079CDCF9ADFB39E0658

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
0x3876C92FCE7B1AD34C64A26D79AFFC3E
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
0x63F9F7B4126F02B3A90DC9CA96F32A09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
0xF475FBF86B7949A2EBCFD13A0009FB3F
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
0xEFB5A55812B6D1D5DD43C9E4A8FC00BD
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
0xE00F255A6EF4C706353F2531036B03E1
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
0x258CD8CE51F7158835032C00FBE4E9C7
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
0x2C93E83CA26F6E4C0DCE05EF27199499

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
0xAA7F04A675A6D116F07E2D3E247FCAE3
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
0x6B11010286185DF31431C816D4FC3597
holding the note before her spectacles.
0xA0AC78FAB9373CD5B9CF1648BF4EBC65

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
0xED2A00E077445BF727104909E90BA3D7
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
0x954F9B376D29D5895319B8CD40D1F23D
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
0x215345A5ED1925BCDC5E7C2AC23B1468

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
0x1E9DB73B30A4CA061F025D5CAABE099C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
0x824FF7555145593C5C7EF35A118879A8
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
0x68E7A4EA2D88319142201BE2599FEABC
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
0x6B748841F247799712679B3383774EB4
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
0x7D7F605E6AB73883D0148D0D7FB88953
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
0x573AD7E3A2A2EABDF3FACBC0BF66B274
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
0xA1831E7BAB2DDFDC54A696ADDA1959D9
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
0xF01488B275C70DEB4FCC9F37B6FED0A2
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
0x02A5EACF3EF251C990A5C2167377DCE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
0x720AD405E7FBA4808AB734DC651A576A
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
0x4C7C0B2E961753DF0B597EA8DD33C64D
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
0x43C37F8DFD25A4FE4C1B6E36623F9510
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
0x15452104A465DAE57719C8970441DE63
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
0x9C60A95F44424E7A93FEC5AF4171B53E
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
0xEE1AC6AA73A3856DDAA4933BA8DC4E61
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
0xEF6117A9759C4C4015319A91C23A0226
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
0xC05B43F8B7DFB1D2DE22C1D7B3658D00
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
0x25FBDC56931467897A7CDE4D918B884D
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
0xFD1A569655DD28C0F28A1610A2D3E649
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
0xEC57ACC785CEA8A3780342C281DE2BD1
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
0x923140AAED2E8786B1158109529366AC
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
0x4E3825B1F87576EB5D40A7F335B7CF83
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
0x973D2681706F527E53A1510FA2D3974D
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
0xAB62FF944DA3D5DD79FB343669B45192
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
0x525B8C0383315F8587DD14D7B261A694
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
0x54787DA7216B028A96315911EA8148F5
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
0x722C0F6C8B77538A43B7F51F05C75BC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
0x233672E29A1BA5054796E221522C7B75
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
0x0BF43F01F3DC1ED3C8A02CBE236D5DEF
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
0x0B7D21A7B70CE851EA7A2031761B4A6D
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
0xE099B0A72C8B0308B23E2DBA3E2968B3
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
0x65CDF5AE0011578AA3AD5DCAF751060B
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
0x7BE03F143A131F6021D5BE5318ECE886
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
0x8CC43C6BB3318E9FC1FFE24E83FD7BD9
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
0xEF85903557E4386A0EF34F513716A4F1
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
0xC7692FC55910799E5582CBD0A04F188F
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
0x51B686B968881FD9EC0A548CD6EA10ED
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
0x6FEF68F76875F9279610D05A56E98F96
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
0xC1726BB176D920B42F78C049646D82A7
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
0x42E8FF63F598683AE493B6185B72CC05
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
0x1B1E2A41234C77EEFA28425660AF407D
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
0x967444FEF84037387DE64430C44712E4
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
0x8F955EB73BD12301720CA6936376CE52
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
0x153C9E45951F0CC087CBAA3C613E70BD
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
0x52CF3EB6EF287D72CAA1E7104CAEB22C
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
0x6E225C87CB41F214C4294C4824E296B9
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
0xE882EF3F874AD0FD46AF52CC4E0CF11F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
0xF98C66DFA51467BED76AD089D439457A
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
0xA5478EBC168D1EBA0226E32A7AB27A06
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
0x85AC0ADADE5281445683FC99AF5AE780
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
0x5DA9BF2039751D30755C90817C74029D
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
0xD47AA97C39687B2FD3C4E50B012CB136
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
0xF3DB0C2B2DA35ECF35FB3EF6792DAEAB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
0xC35849531ED2399EE6FD36410C53FA69

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
0x5140807695D233DC4FF7E3098E8794F1
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
0x5C37DE019D9FE1F8CB1CB9105E55F4C7
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
0xBAAC2EB821D5BF451D05BFF8D54399BA
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
0x23DEA7D28608700F20D1BDDD065E6801
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
0x89D57E6FCCE56DAF895ADA3DACB47F5C
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
0x89FD93BA31B08CEC57080E6FCEA6BA22
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
0x4ADC7327D45B87BBA191305F9247684B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
0xDA5C29AC19625F778744548C63B248CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
0x70E39D39C907CC92A3CA4315B681D80B
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
0x5B371ED36EE60EBA2D04F11A7A618EC8
the money she gets."
0xE3839C90A760B5B5935FB6FE6C8FA927

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
0x4008F27EA22752B9A943D22A3FC8B105

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
0x0243020722EFB9BA88031EFF3BA5D645
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
0xE2F326C8ACBC09683E4750549A22490A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
0xD9B9577535F50B5B8B3431696BE27035

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
0xC1866EDE7330D99B1B3C57A82B38D4C4
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
0x98033DB0AA5B22D71D14ABF32D0DFF5E
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
0x579285ACA5489FF2021C571C897DFB10
excluded.
0x2F5C7F59EC70EEBD0F00D99BD9B1799F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
0xA18A192EA7E7076E5942BE6F642DD54E
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
0xB484A9FE816EA9F970678B7DCCADC427
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
0xC1C91D504740320B8210F6D57A7E85E5
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
0x4849949C03A6FBF5EC48EFE6DA949700
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
0xFAAD1F921245DCEEC5F4E5EE8A72E8A1
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
0xBFC5E0A7B8D95E1F3BA2415D0DA2C7A5
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
0x5DAA4B331BE648B25E45E9D1EDD3C35F
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
0xBA37467C791128B53E9621FE5F0AD274
sides.
0x70156A8470156A84F5AB02C63857DB93

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
0x4F18A12317ACC6F05350FDF0C895B566
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
0xE2FDC513D2333FCA587C7808617737AF
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
0x4BA17560FBAAB93EDCE9B0AA6257DC31
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
0x134796CCB3A01E869492AB529104A95D
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
0xCD7EE2BFA6B747018C01BD7F612757B2
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
0x6259C5ADF129BAD8D6E50035FADF90C5
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
0x97B8D55A5700F49F02D4D663CDDBEF5F
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
0x34695E0C158AC1CC1A471843775F37DA
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
0x9F3DD20716E82E120C01E37480193098

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
0x6D775C6AFB70291035658E5B1633E63A
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
0x735CE2F1CAD5CE7C40F4D67FA70FEC23
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
0xD0A6C87F36BF9ECA089F837CA63269DF
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
0xD9E918CF6698951378092B524430C3AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
0xF9F2B0ED3C41AF53E2DD3EB4A32597EE
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
0x20E1F3B3BAE30A62D323BCC92F7C0C81
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
0xEB8C536591FF0F5C93A7DAA2897A254E
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
0x1E60FC9AE4BB9BAB24AC9DF662562300
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
0x339C47CFC83B02CC47997938E97F4801
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
0xDC8C75451E48CE7EEE330A941180D7A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
0x90FC789D564308D8CC3162EC59C0D1BB
minutes."
0xFBDA5CCDF25EE4C3EA76D077B2D7284C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
0xBDEFF6F17F55D8D328CE60372D3CBA88
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
0x65309069C129CA644787F8336FE7A277

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
0xE5E3BD7483B4606D0E402D12563E398F
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
0x4D5B4FD142B362E610F4D8A038691E14
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
0x10AE6B90DF8648187CC29D5D8249F3B0
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
0xD9B3EE19649075248659A4E1A15E4EE8
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
0xA5385B721F0D486F3DA338F7F19F14CC
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
0xB10087025D70FEC16A5586DBA91FA7D0
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
0x852A221CDDAF6FAFF4BD8C5183097687
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
0x2C2462A183ACEA10FEF8AF44AC8685C0
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
0xD57ABDA2EFBAE8A5D18B1E2EDA7F9EF6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
0xCF36CCD57B0435115D4395E0B84F5A69
below.
0xD9E2068ED9E2068EC475E5AA13C853DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
0x3B8AB85C7F5E82AD3F13A1F4595D4105
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
0x786DA72B074964252081C333A7DDD1A4
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
0x31E20929D6649F6A216FF4007E64688F
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
0x60F99728E0DFCF50C05D1BD636A4421B
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
0x4D6C34983565C7C3EAF47749CE1BD5CB
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
0x91D961DDE8E9BC9E3F0A04C65E3BB872
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
0xCD421AB72AB32D0DE7141BA38CA75268

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
0xD07B0E5B8844D6F1F02EBB51AF107BD7
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
0x3C87BEFF5FB381D39DFF576F4851FA9B
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
0xA5DC99098566A192C6E2571368CFE73C
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
0xE07CACE37EF44D4A68083AEF0E9C15D7
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
0x4681B500892FC816B13C8A9B2B30756C
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
0x370F6B7FDE136720DB80A6AD04941062
and, for a time, a hush.
0x5CD8CE6DBB14146C0A25127105F8D287

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
0x73AF8DD16F58651B2C7F61E141057FD1
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
0x19FA5C1719E0724398261130BB967BF2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
0xD1CDE96444992F4FE97A32B6786D2BAB
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
0xC685B09E4A844CD6C229DDCB091188E4
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
0xAE0127ECF28AEE1BB8F0E7CC04250CA3
on apprend."
0x0A0706DB4F49ACA10D89898AB8EC410B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
0xD7C99606D481270518FBF15ED1B687E8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
0x74C36F800B9A7CD1090C3E17A6FF77CC
mange."
0xFFA94513FFA945130A8B0A7414A011E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
0xAF662C3A102B46B9EBB94C4131B1049A
get you something to eat."
0x7E9322204817F7314329E20034D82B16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
0x11BE6320F83C6A777082C97B6BC82023
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
0xC7B08BFCE6DC1C6425073AF4E21E84E3
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
0xC8BC49D2610FE5F746BBA52540854C96
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
0xD5DE58D52FCCDEB13C08578A1E39C3D6
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
0x8AEE932ED461AD640B5F3893718559A8
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
0x997551FAC43C415D46B79DF2ED50FAF4
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
0x1E30B159DC2F459A31C5CA0163F08EDA
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
0x3E9CBC41E04FE065F9DA7DC4E03AF774
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
0x8EDBFA5F503E3F740A0801E4EE6F4AB1
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
0x21DDA14413C530C354A4288906CF80B8
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
0xDAEFB84FB25C93EBD0035C81305396C6
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
0x37D6A4979710AE0FF0793BD8377F4FE3
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
0xCE76DE2FEB8C52D40D44DEF71F6EA347
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
0xA477A29DE608290C97129131064C4948
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
0x98B23514D736E3DDA77A2CF2D3E9BB20
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
0xA44A82615543D6EB64E49A9248EBFF5B
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
0x044B342D2BC126BCEEC1B35A68569069

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
0x6D1ADA89671B1EDFD1501CC9A9CFB776
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
0x6FEE8684FB38BEACDC5F1EB5B700C10E
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
0xF4CC15852CBE6BD2DCAD180640AEADCD
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
0x8D0882C180C3D9063FBEA14498845FD0
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
0x49CEF8AED06E15DFBEEDC0EF2F659DB1
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
0x372A768E479E16455277D1C4C2CF2269
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
0x982A9ADE62FE01F0ADC755B204FF6A05

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
0xCC42AFC94F6771B6B9A74749466515C9
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
0x72EF6100D6D259CC83FBA7E03F71B383
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
0x70B3B4923E10035205E8DC010284B4FF
dinner?"
0xD11C2FB12519378B5A62C54D181B066A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
0xAE26B2833577DF7B3559B0F1B40EB301
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
0x92FFF42A07F81A5221925244EE4746FD
is your dinner."
0xE87E730BE06555538D7A44819D0202EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
0xAEBD3ED3CDBC21E7B7F5509A1D4C6B3A
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
0x0177F33015BB251E45FD028F999C42D3
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
0x9EADD05ED297639F9BD13B1122FF9F82
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
0x1213025F5439F92534426C01C00952D0
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
0x8A99E22ABC0C1540E94ACD96D659FAFF
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
0x479EFDC45A87D2235034DB259112E41D
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
0x076080A4F2332C2BA44F464AE18780FD
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
0xFB60FDAEB40F648E484442A23D187A84
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
0xB33AB53ECA197EBCF3636867D6E011AC
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
0xC392FB598B02E7190FC57A82560FB62F
quel dommage!"
0x2E1B60E1F79239D845944B029D8ED2C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
0x4E0E123260110A25807032E6F196CCE1
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
0xE9EEB6FCDCD97BFF31F905236A3A5AA1
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
0x8020B4996CA7F2BDC0549FA7CC005065
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
0xE92B2CE0A4D9B03C198A8E6BB9096E57
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
0xF29E8BE4F5B5C48C1A6229F5E32B1A47
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
0x36D6BEBE19A5B3FE0564A672A4BAD09D
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
0x9066523270FA01ED26016E12C98DB47D
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
0xC4CBF953AE056E84217E511D78FE2E9C
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
0x581F975193DAB801C95AD9A5DC409852
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
0x1A1AF5437009090130E9709D2D8CE57C
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
0x5B03CB90A3A50913A0D1B79E9535229A
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
0x10C29CB711EF954FA54D1D58B8FEF832
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
0xA46E9E1B1D566CC6EAA0560C3570DCF5
by distance inarticulate, into words.
0xEDDDB86C8C150AE4D7C53B12CCA4E539

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
0xE41FDF917AF93DB139090BCCF4D5537C
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
0x0F9A8A38E59B36E8E5E5C1C8D012C59F
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
0x3A4843743EF5950BC6F4263672CECC64
sought their chambers.
0xC870A6BEFAFBE631B3EB239A06CFFCD6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
0xCCD19400CD33C2D56DFCE88FD0F58D6D
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
0xAC29DC36424E21DC124FD20841D5E4A2
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
0x8261632D05B37F739127E43490D0D828
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
0x5BF2555A9E35016D07E72CB14C1C73D5
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
0x3CE136265E5A755C87B25085503ACEF0
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
0x1DAFCE1B8FF1119400566CAB0D90FF75
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
0xF5F5D3B01143B493714C49A32CE7F471

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
0x6345FDBFEA69485ABCB9D74695409350
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
0x51772472EEC2AEA78556333878AE7E18
ladies."
0xA5B9BA3446FBEDEFED3AF17EBB28DE9D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
0x4AC9E1617D56A57FF887FF5243130FB6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
0xFCDA5CDBF45906703562D14A0B763931
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
0xCAE46C9465B6BDDA332A1557C9F453A0
never had a glimpse of it yet."
0x8AA3D6FD1BB23896DCB347FDCEF9CCB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
0x1C6A08E2EC3A9B3E08AD760BD486AAB9
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
0x1F61F253516FECE80CC7A495DB58049E
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
0xEE5934BF0902705193BAF52981988E24
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
0xD3E160DFF82A7C5B1C0C095183F61C60

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
0xD885DBC0B4B71EAA8B9C51C712734131
answered.
0xFC5090D0C56F868A004289B239AEA22D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
0x203F958A77C495FE5680A8691C1868E5
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
0x28FD0F05DC9D4E9CE2D960FA578F0F1B
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
0x4B51B97EDAD256AA846205285ED5EC0F
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
0x918CEEB2D3075B4538A91B862EF3DAAD
case of contumacy.'"
0xDE0094B331CB4F7662109FB2CB602DDF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
0x03FE63E37A4264B0147B65FBC290D35A
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
0x514A060AB70A8F5D5839CDC6BAEB23A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
0xB7C23CE10F5FA62ACB42F6B2445FCF36
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
0x6B23D12B2D051D2FEC4925AA68F0137B
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
0xFBDD100BC72BCF5DA6C53EDE217CACCA
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
0x37BD3188B25966DD7ECA436C8784639C
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
0xD6200682C1D43E4266C72580EEFC89E8
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
0x4E261FC49CE7858B4D58FC59C55D98DD
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
0x6378E7543DCA2AD7097A0B54A997F597

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
0xD3A6623BA20FFF84AF46E8E32629F59B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
0xFF585F07B1C8DFED4DA9AF7625263645
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
0x4CB8A393E49A287D4A2AAD6F38F13B16
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
0x1428F188D55FE3283F69EC71B13DB436
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
0x00971D581FB9B5C7EEB1E712E111DC80
stay at Thornfield."
0x30490AED02AC5EC38608E07B23C2950E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
0xE3721C764FBF688637F091A4BA64B47B
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
0x3A7BB282613D2C4B1EE086C82255E6E3
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
0xD92D6EB552564FDA77D35A400D338C6B
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
0x3CF932C7C98C4D721995F45BAC000AC5
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
0x22A26A919FD22AADBE636C4EB6CFFC51
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
0xDA27C9301BBB1601246C2C9A067FEE44
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
0xAC815B1933179864A37BD5A65A1655B5
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
0x043245F6D90CAA511C12EAE1C16285EC
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
0xD4D1FC96F99F3417B65B585C0F56E106
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
0xE916A1F3DF73F06EA250F5C993397593
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
0x360D16E8B784D31518B3BAB77F7A2D85
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
0xCDF3EB4DC4142C5EBEDB22E48F563455
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
0x628BF4408B55887B6FC9FFF33F092DD2
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
0x5738F8FCA36A1746311D6E0841C27DB2
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
0x97FA0C74144B8CF2DDBD29271E5BDD8C
descended.
0x292742C9672CC3C8742FBA1C79572FCF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
0x9FB84FABB33B2CB150A80FED2D71F5E0
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
0x0DC69626C1E299B827E641F8243AA921
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
0x5E4BC6483ECF5705A4EEA486F04F7B98
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
0xFFCF89FF73E6B056C9B281B85C78A774
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
0x037344FF8924F6BDE70BECA1AEAF4787
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
0x1C3A645DE5450623F0C1D4AA2DFFF0FF
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
0x2E2C63B0EFF3A7CD7820CDA563CE79DF
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
0x382ED19EEB19B48C479125158E3D7A1E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
0xFBAC1CF344473D7A149C782F86CAB413
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
0xC7A633DA9A6F556CDA122E70E0C06EAB
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
0x556E8BFB9B72568F4B62F0799BF963EA
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
0x89E764E25C99016320AC4BC8E847B240
touched my knee.
0x8A692D30661A2F69E6E84DE3941D7776

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is it, Adele?"
0x318A672D925E66E08BE86D1AC38E23C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
0x69F88A9F9A6A3E0BBAB81BA3B7F5B94A
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
0xF254718978ADD68C1A85655A3C095EEB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
0xFA16A507A65AFE50A63619E844982395
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
0x2845F1EDEBD4BC8D03B574BA29F777CA
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
0x6D79FB663EA945DAE213436174ABBD25
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
0x2A038A61797539302104E809A4B5EFCF
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
0xC62211F86DAF6AA248CA12405FFFE821
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
0x3CEDF0196C8EFAF02691758B8CB167BE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
0xEFF67967A477715A926EAB9652E1DD92
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
0xC43FB8FDA846BECF7B8167B046EA1142
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
0xADE5DF01A5E80548D28B849A7864239F
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
0x503C617DF53307AC11BD75D93F27D670
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
0x76443E0F9462F1CF153548798DA35998

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
0xA123AB10CB616EAE72524B2B49C00F75
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
0x40B0FDB3200481C9BD9C8C3D64E7BC62
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
0xA42E4E802D3F78A1B750BD0C7A642FA5
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
0xC6FD5D2B677DC4E7791F1AF0923CD14E
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
0x207DEA29B5F4141A49F6426AFD0E6CE9
stared at me.
0x213C63DF8A605B9A41BA8C2D8906B6B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
0xD1698ECC3732931BAAF44D42556178C8
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
0xC197E7D449FC2E2131D7D9C4C1C74725
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
0x192F97BE1CA60C7DFB744A4044072F44
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
0x34B150EC639EB24B9BC9C6091DDCAB44
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
0x6E943163C5793476255F7AAF16780D57
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
0xEE8DBEF68EF5806E2076D0A270FE48F0
and may as well mention them now.
0xF99185B0A780119E12C6AF875BFC08AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
0xFE9C9A648A34990C426E58C025CA3CD7
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
0xBB99868BCE4F4F5A12CDDCB4471C5D53
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
0x62E7CCA156D1BDD6DD7BD38B39E4270D
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
0x16A1820440025F03DB446C0A9251EC2B
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
0xC4F8C803DFCB78B6891ED97037DC072E
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
0x90C3B23DDD18B42CD740F9A51CE60684
both sisters were fair as lilies.
0xC010694BD2B5FBE401B3FAFBC0AC9EA2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
0x33D6B8090AEF0BD1600C365A23B68253
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
0x132FFC9D5FA0F0639E8328E3E4458E51
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
0x1E2DB5C0B7FD8A5920C931C629364E43
within the circlet of a band of gems.
0xB62BF4360B6534EB9937AC8B69FE70CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
0xB775D1F76029B4588DD518AB83D28A1B
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
0x24F6910F0F98CE8ACB2F6DECFEF0AE44
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
0x42C76F4D6B730D861C44B985B76671A3
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
0x66DE11C54ECB883801FD90E1E6E726E3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
0x293C2B5FB2327B69C6CAF1296EC5C591
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
0xEBDD1794C3F507245C2A84D92A53DE8F
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
0xA925F0E11E40DC880D1D5BD3A631C7C4
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
0x2B520B4715E7A9DA78F3426D7F9E840D
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
0x4E4669EE5AF357E07E3E5E960017419B
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
0x7E010D495F92FA3E82F721D52878288A
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
0xF882C496CBFB2E8CD388D1B55C0EFBFC
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
0x995AF242C852D9BE716C9FE50D61E615
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
0x634F7549D21954B726E288B8BE46995B
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
0x9BD56FCFC2741392AFE9DD92BF249819
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
0x56AB9013FC6B71C150846D12FC47589C
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
0xC20AB22D74150CD74B1C6D98F345007C
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
0x522CFFB4277A1D57332B00AB9ABB2525
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
0x465E9A723629DCCE144B87682DFC8AFF
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
0x9B4339AF65FCDAF3AC2DEA9106119337
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
0x8536CEBEDD9FF4D3E6CBB9C86885938D
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
0xFD1A643DC26325686A0EBDCCA2B89AC5
truly imperial dignity.
0x9D00D8CAA2C363C49E5B0C89CEE02D22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
0xD2598935BBDC0B2FC5B7964F775CEFCF
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
0xEC4565C09AEA694DABFF36465B1EA906
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
0x62FA893463D62775A68D2DBA69812BDB
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
0xAA51903C3F779AABE73FE77704C8A11A
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
0x4768A022EDF34D0D182F505FC41F5B7E
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
0x76BCE1428074EE858366C599B903930D
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
0x82154DCB93B43BF227B941C6CF36F2E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
0x4FBBC99786259F36655726F91C661A58
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
0x2F875A5FCD9B990E105922DD17A38A93
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
0x5BF34A6DCFF047B4C8A1710E6EA2070C
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
0x1868D6FDC585EBB4D3FD74FD3EF799B8
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
0xA97A23EB423851FDDC50B20CDB101AB6
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
0x4368B5B6DD60000FA0605DC0A3D6D71D
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
0x800CD7B09DC4A02CCC2F14A59562C420
haughty lip.
0x71D1E04CFC77631F9E7F957098036F92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
0x37AF40C6381DF58839A61F0E47C58314
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
0x466084F941E0F555428DE2271B04F6DE
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
0xD291851D79E4FCC24A75CAD8000F6848
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
0x7DFD7FAFF5318994D4E5372531A906AA
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
0x454C946B3F1D22AD29C34F38CA80C306
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
0x8FEBD3CB52761AE61F1F0C6FEF196AC2
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
0x03C68D59815DFA8BB7D8522A1C5342FA
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
0x43CA066D4EB04C6D571D5CF487BCEC9F
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
0x389AE5CB31720D2406EDCC33E6A953C9
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
0xB525F5D05CC174EF6AE7932F405D660B
with fluency and with a good accent.
0x5A51096E77F878328BA8B1D431802770

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
0x39472603D1F6C7E378C31281C809C2F6
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
0x72FB0E157FA1FF8D63B6ED510EB80EFB
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
0x08972868856219AC72019FAE086E77EC
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
0xF44347491EC8B1E377D9B02270BB61B1
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
0xD30116636D8EF8905777AAE652ECAD5C
in spotless white.
0xA29DB91C23B690A638A47FBD7A2E76D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
0xE9C7C06520DB5559AF4300A982D2EF02
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
0xD66ADAF0B9110F5BB62B2A9F54EEDDB2
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
0xD5C6A046D1BCCFF10E6B215FD878FD60
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
0x5B2F355852F1DEC14337EB2D600FE892
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
0xEA11E2D74CF8C3583C94F2292648D795
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
0x2B1B0985BF684802BDFA3FAC4B9F5FE5
together.
0x67D43B73325D0F3129BC421D5E438512

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
0x918149C07D53700C4AAB24977695426A
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
0x571B43FFDEB23F034AB4A54F295ECF3C
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
0x3E7B043028007EC9EAADA391FC0BCAF9
gravity--
0x699772DDBD713C0BB1804024DAAF320F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Bon jour, mesdames."
0xED4ECC5124D6E2A5FD13C1BD05979F2B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
0xDC513E4AE7B2ED3D47C6EE546555FF9E
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
0xC7810C5888448A27EBBC66BEF80333F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
0x9082F44E2724E6626A89848CCABB311F
little French girl he was speaking of."
0x13C377262BD38377169FCF9DE55CAF73

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
0x10D366065437AD05593CDA00AA60A351

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
0xBA333D0D675A767A6E34E281576FEF49
child!"
0xAC869C5CAC869C5C288213D084AC3110

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
0x6D81F6AF5AA25D7F88091E47E034A0E2
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
0x14AF295021242CCC2C19B5B9E1DCD2BF
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
0xC1D2AEA485A37603AB507553456116D1
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
0x3BF182E9B210AAACC80152F119B8ABBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
0x93C554B4AAC487F7CADBFB8965ABF3C7
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
0xA6F1326BC4F6997BFC22C7739199FB5F
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
0x3664EAE88CD86DD35609DF66044F1509
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
0xD93643C8BC1518AD971E4100EFBE899E
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
0x0D3864599003675EC41F2F74F308803F
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
0x38D459F3B149EBD5C70E4160BC2251D2
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
0xD83433C38AD5A8372EFF1921B2FD36FE
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
0x593836B435238367B59E01954CDA6259
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
0x8B3F64488D27D6198E514ABEF237E4DF
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
0x09383F9EE5DF1D6FF596FEDBDA9B7613
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
0x163D339C976A67A5EABFD55D481B94C8
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
0x17B9C561E7B64479163492BE1E46FCA3
blood or vigour of brain.
0x56C31AB8080C6F3711D7346FEFE8674B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And where is Mr. Rochester?
0x6A4E87398BBE8BC0E034A7AE1FA91B59

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
0xCA2700A87F71D5023CC6D9006B76C91C
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
0xA531C5E84C6E02989CC5B27965A51403
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
0x477052FBCC084FCB591154E2C5BE9726
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
0xADBA20D3A2282226D42707765755C2F5
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
0x6EEE6AA797E1DDEB567F814A3CD306ED
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
0x188339E295A92070CAFCD41AB80610FF
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
0x3E5792F5DAE59321C5AEFD8015EB7670
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
0x99CAC3CCE3791D12D092D6BF9650F4F3
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
0x1FA12C3A5846595D608998C59F532AB0
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
0xCA42CB3B0CDF4F391CF88C930F71376D
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
0xFD13165E3A18DBE2719A005169BC11A5
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
0x0878F6DC370A350A8E722756EED190FE
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
0xF252BB88953A601E4687C5C045E991F6
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
0x338DF4608F13BF5D84EEB995F5E32EF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
0x2D5957A59B0EE949CFBC4C13D2339CD9
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
0x4DCA6FC4B098726580D72FA28AD48618
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
0x2095B8B0995BDC7B02377975F3D7899B
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
0xDB761A251333843A695D8A9AC7FB6AFF
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
0x066F24A79CC3187DA34B76321400F2D0
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
0xEA3D60784A79DB0600BCF17A5E776B07
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
0x71AC30AAB7998BE84461F2BFC573AD5C
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
0xF3694D11B840DA3CCDBBE1C90A4BC9D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
0xFB19E330754AB5E031454909B2438EAA
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
0x80082F51AE00C99A81DF2118315E65FF
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
0xF9C3D94B1C785266792775005DB16A35
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
0x12DF43CE3BAF041699262D0A59C02BCE
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
0xD2800E3685CE60AC21AAA6785D4CBBFA
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
0xCE5D92BF23C34849405348EAE3E40D8E
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
0x435F0DC257F41074BE1B79A0E1074AEA
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
0x59714211188824A75005451B72FB299F
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
0x315022DDEF99FA2CEB51CFB0E2D6F7BF
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
0xF2DCFB72E655518D0AA792674B131758

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
0xA3929A05052401579AE2C38E3D632EF5
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
0x4A058822B6E2B918CECBB3ED8ED2A269
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
0xFCAF94F583E878A1A58D13E55A1FCC44
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
0x89B5AE693625025AB5DC55287CB07F53
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
0xDA1A76154393FC96ADB27761EAC8FC0B
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
0xB35BD478E646910386330EE76D549CB0
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
0x0C6AB9A73A2BC45A21594C81FD79824A
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
0xDFBF4F20F6F2ADC773BEB8F14C814F91
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
0x522967F61D7E8928DFCEA830D301067C
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
0x3B790EDB5966934DFD4719528F10B7D2
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
0x37BBCA2CFA79427E1ADBDC10DE966541
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
0xD44641A7864C854C925130E302A0E57E
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
0xD89684619F9F5C3884D73E4D1EBAB9C2
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
0x311AB15C0CAD185A19A5256640D15995
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
0x3F72411C120638661DB99B0180F5C87B
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
0x1D5C68BB326E10DFD95522768D135045
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
0xA52B3F1331FE5CB6AA4AD266CB023613
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
0xCCE860D6427C11AB4A0B86F9ADA0426A
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
0x03E8DE10697F84FBA3CBED90C2626829
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
0x793A6DA5FEAD088A8DEFC57935702381
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
0xF2E657C48536BF2E7C690F38D0E51F51
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
0xF48DD583D532186028BE3E915A474E2B
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
0x9EFCCB2F7CCDF83D4E35CE192C5FAEB3
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
0x2190364A6FEF73A5734127E75678CCF3
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
0x55E1C10F86D9BB9467C04CE83763EB66
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
0x00BB5223C9D9535C5FEF61EDC215C2A1
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
0x64AD99A0EF8398A3346E6CC386494C0C
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
0x24FC2A71E8AD9BFA0441B1972CB0F4D8
breathe and think, I must love him."
0x426C5496F03ECD5E25EDE4BF354B17A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
0x9B49771C93842C702BB0B66D719EF6C2
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
0xA6BB786C7F6E2A9C879667E4D42BEB01
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
0x79912F7E5F4BC7514F39700646DA71AF
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
0x1B78C9BC7A681E1033C1453C934636C5
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
0xCFBC16C813F30D8EED2F89BD91747F21
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
0x8882427C7804E89DD74B43EC9964B8B1
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has

taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
0x3F5CAD2374AB11698739B6B9E7FE460B
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
0x81A109156C57A0E1D2CD879B1B0ED1CF
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
0x744941041B04A372E7E709618420A596
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
0x50E6625486FE40C37774FD6349E354BC
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.

Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
0xD9484F073984D494240ED6A9DC039EF2
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
0x9A96A96FA18678C5D0083F63B25E9538
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
0xEAB7711823C0261606613447EEDEE9A9
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
0xEE49750A7C10DBD1C521ACDFECA28931
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
0xED124C35D6E3D30889BC5BEDA4483C5C
selects a mate.

Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
0xA5290D05C662A31403208A7D1F0D3232
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her

station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"

"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
0xF8933885622F597F558BD5E46175812D
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
0xEEEC5DE3A690E7C24DDC6E5774BB848B
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
0x62F3188C34C44FA77D4A60EDB49683E4
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
0x4FFB2250657B7E9E27A6D5E6B6B02834
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."

I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.

Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the

mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
0xC9F523E29CEBFC0C606210499B275BFF
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
0x76540813338108AD2E9BC3793CB7E7DA

her question with an explanation.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
0x3E60768CF0C6EC6C9E68F13EB282A1AB
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
0xBD3463F15971DCBCF14AA5BF1FDBEC3D
Heaven I have now done with them!"

Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
0xC565F14CC3ACBFA777E24095EF072C70

0xDE49289480F2D3DEDBDB763976CDC2F0
the anathematised race was present.

0x6671A9C49BBC4919AF01B46929D3768F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
0xBE0650A2078BDC59616106A70C13A278
three times with portentous significancy.
0x1B9D0E0B57D248218C9CD613BA663373

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the

whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
0x263A10A5049128593098445490C4C613
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
0x3896D0ABB48FACBA23275AB8A94090D9
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
0xCF9E62F7E043D50E0BBAFF3FEEDD9246
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
0xB6F5D41B305AEA2CDC905437109ACB58
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
0x92CA77A5A5042F8A859678D10C1AA916
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
0x1E029642AAB9513BE39E9EC082CBB4EF
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
0xD89656632D7AEA61FF78DB658BCA8E99
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
0xB834CA3BD61359D112FD9457F23E5A8A
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
0x39EF27AA697ACC2D18D55D5614DF8200
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
0x29687791B4DBD94B6C5AB47676F34D06
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"

"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
0xD72441E3CD8D6F10A34F364C5FEFCE07
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
0xB23A33F800F710EA0617B30B33E36915
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
0xBAE1F03CF286CD28F99FFFDCE93DAB7A

persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
0x9E432613A5ADDBABBA6DE24646EDC118

0xB196E7F787D8CF6FF24FEE159965D052
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
0x5963B2CA6430F5F7973906D5573D3A82
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
0xEE11BEAAC60E33FCE097C3A5DEB3AC5A

0x290ED09641D184BA2CB95F4F20D0CE50

0x43FCE167643B55EFEC7B6E06C729CD85
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
0x687FE515514BD3F13E92D3DE24E52255

"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a

thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never

"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know

them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and

consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance

Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
0xD225BFB78AEC274EB21F6952047A8395
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
0xFA5CB517A826A959EA3B92FC1E665156
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her

workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
0x2492D686E3A171A1A91FFAB62063903B
she would give us anything we asked for."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
0x19611C794056A97098A77C7BD531893E
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
0x86D4679DADED41CD9110B5FD84F4D6A2

0x38DA141787201B13223D49A0EDC52BBA
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
0x509B553B6EAE0CC4DC32AE02E50C4680
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
0x06043FDE13ED2435156F97F2780CBD17
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my

"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried

Mr. Rochester.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
0xEF56FDE531BBD281273ACE160F681DD2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
0x7834C48826687476B5759547C0FF9573
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
0x0445D8D71784126585B3A8BF3B0D9DA5
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
0x10BEE43B0C31571DCA2D16E7C988B33E
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
0xCF08CDFBAE579FA75DDAF503EAACB929
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
0xAC4EF55B1278D1489D96856EA969351F
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
0x22FF249290B77A4BFB09D95192ECC1B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
0x193D0E842E855DBB7A865B447885C90E
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
0xEF5A57438CBE1ACEF644898131DC0035
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
0xD5F97C4B5CAFEDED88159D78DDD28780
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
0x76A9B7E23DE0603315C3DEA42FD5A812
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
0xA3AA2284EF100F63273DE5F29C74A6F3
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
0xC4F6218D179215D663ED32471D978BDD
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
0x680A0A9B10CC76E0090265BBA1C7BDD0

0x1249D673F7A96A1160319A0ACE85BA37
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
0x9B7340DC05C016B84FE9FB861142B339
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
0x9E64387632311E9217D9D9EAD5FF4573
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."

"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
0x15F41158743970005B282542188D0014
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
0x0F26DA28F4D92A59328399ED4A9C9D77
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
0xFE4E00B8E2FC7438632B77EC6AFA0B13
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
0xB1D674728F7B19E8C08DE7F4B7583016
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
0x43FFEAA211960929C5515508D9A96309

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am all obedience," was the response.
0x416B95DC372744E39966892E0BFEDA45

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that

reason, sing it _con spirito_."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
0x772F9FD09C728CF0D1B06E18E6B82932
water."
0xF94BC5F4F94BC5F421C8879CABB392D1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
0xB79B05CAF0C33AB2EFC7869EF874E9F0
such things _should_ be done."
0x9AD588E845000AA770B34D985F8830FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to

proportionate punishment."
0xE5E0064D09E86FA58E33B2AFEE3BE77D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
0xAE76C09E98272B14FE969794D2697E60
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
0x4031FD9BF0CB977C9939E48EE12B2881

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
0x6758A980219DA2442CA4AFE940651099

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
0x4DE6A47AA31AB77F20304F451DEC6124
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
0x85D771A923B872313143A87770F16CEA
capital punishment."
0x4B4463E12B98455CB4BCCACE93E4841B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
0x9843D92C520B2D87378C5E6279A8C988
accompaniment in spirited style.
0x8FEADA579BF1088AA8393C7A97B1C0FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
0xB90FF4646697C2E4A31A1A07FCC32690
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
0x30B3EC03386AA5FDC2E2248F4EA691F1
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
0x6840C42B31140792A09633D7219B05DF
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
0xAE01D92C67923EBE47C51CF0C5F8DFCC
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
0xB800C74CE6FE2E2A244F265A7C0B5DFF
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
0x295A6246640341EF63AF6ABD2B7F2137
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
0xCB18B99626FD50C815447785C0F26D8C
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
0x72CFC8FE57C446FC619C4A035D44B6FB
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
0x02A7C2AF9EC5F071B527A98E577EB58E
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
0xB03BCD44AC05D804793E261E6C8FED77
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
0xD45D6026C42E8E97593C75AB60834119
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
0x39B42218E9B15B21C298CCFAA7BDF641

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How do you do?" he asked.
0xB01825C06287EF0B06EF532D1A25F7A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am very well, sir."
0x12FE9B4A583297CA6B60AABEB635B388

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
0x85337CB730E5E42FACB58A3F95ECAFF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
0xB471AFA0B45A1512C4A8DF8DBAF6A62F
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
0x6C9EC31ACCEAB7C91E7F5FAD590C1249

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
0x89F663CB07454D515D1F445231A615B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
0x08BE857A667CF5F88BC66ABD50543761

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
0xD444548AC262090D1F3D64B14763092F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
0x1F71EA0D4ACA5C39F1B107752A3217C5
What is the matter?"
0x7C547E0D0795D62335F00BD44E19A7B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing at all, sir."
0xE83A4512F9DB41EBABB8B8F7CB50EB11

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
0x2B46D3802BF50634FB431ECCCF07B1A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not the least."
0xFF8E0A013A75A23BDA430D4E93293E64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
0x2DC07C75A701CAACC9749F66C27C5D20

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am tired, sir."
0x9C411D480FB79EC20539529872302641

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked at me for a minute.
0x1696AD625F3492E338DFB7CD7BE93340

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
0x6AA596F0BBA533210B3EA292D1A443B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
0x13D4BA9ED89126FD6FFABF58E5A0F99A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
0x2CC92D31CF806E1F3FDE7CA3CB2CDF6E
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
0xF113223E5DF1D2A3E018E55DED9FC0A3
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
0x83FCFB33573067F431BC4FE0D803279E
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
0x16675323FA15B71CAA7A8032D1627E12
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
0xE3CEAC6529754D1917B75509B1A86BB5
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
0xA1A3DDA50CED12DD805FAADA26BE331F
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
0x909C51794F834DFFFB1D839D840B7776
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
0x04C7C56CAE382B7CDC9263E0B5E04CDE
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.

CHAPTER XVIII
0x501C82C3EAA2D780A5B5C0C435205B5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
0xEF69A2D33748679559BB49C7E068BD9A
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
0x582AF0788FA446B610D21171DDEB96EB
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
0xCB98761661AB47E1A0AE165EE338AE4E
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
0x864F8F66E4A413B8840BA9E5CDA1549B
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
0xAD8ED16F59687E8F0142953317D9C472
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
0x0CFF35A72047311737D50142C21D6716
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
0x2A64C95AA701ED83BD48C7862DF45454

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
0x12C3E9FBB43E461A30E2F1EE33359CEB
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
0x65E7FA676796C875CE38E8DDC8807571
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
0xFF5C7A56A705B6FC4106B77E985C8E0D
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
0xF03747A26D7DCF771D348CD4747FCF22
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
0xB9B523DBBE58BDA94AEDF3FA99E1C7B3
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
0x6674B4DE0E59AD90C113A721165F5B7A
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
0xE394385BCD521C0C48D733AF77C65619

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
0xFD13A7657F666C6E2A2D9AFCB3FCEFAD
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
0x2B0F92CB74D7DC9ED2FF09B4A55A0016
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
0x783EB6CCA0185F7BC560C4D9994E6205
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
0x0E4B74687C1250A160FAB0F119F3D7CC
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
0x29BAD43AD0BC45AFB3FC06AA468641DD
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
0xD6310300F35BF49ABD8A80201703C580
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
0x8D844451344381CDC22A6421DEED996B
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
0x8BAE62CD29EF7460B80A388C3F34ADD3
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
0x369AE4F7977ED7D4BDADA564A75505F4
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
0x8D6BB23B52BD5CC36D8C8702A966EE1A
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
0x11CD9D864BF1899583CB703A9AC4AC0D
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
0xBDEE8736947AB184CAE99EF23BB31007
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
0x72170673CCF6EF594A2E8D3A117755C0
drawing-room.
0xBE674E1FD95BB589DF42BAF3D3DBF662

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
0x67D6ADFB89BD4208A13A8E0E9D9A5F3D
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
0x6CB9554DD06B84647624330A83741D9A
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
0x29D2B14445F370E0EBEE8197CBA6F690
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
0x6B24A9B96384F127F3DE5E1531AC37EA
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
0x786C5854D32C0A739099E4B159AB3281

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
0xF2F8CA2CA2D1808DB2DDAE5B4A1BE935
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
0xBAD77C523659A01A3859F72044B610EE
usual seat.
0x387A0D0BE9749CB0158C107CF00C85DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
0x2DCFAAD0E0940BF14B89BDEC35D14A23
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
0x3635A11D8372736C630A812B89C69688
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
0x8D0107529AE834176424AB2C6A68D05B
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
0x7D769279D64D17C3F57FFC424D08F579

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
0x2D0811475D56B5E67AD05D6AC34D68F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
0x37EF643F195CB773D12EBBD4F33AC31E
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
0x890AF2E4EDE3E2A0E08337D10E7F2EF4
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
0x0B05DAC568B9CF41FF37D33BED43F4A4
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
0xA0C2E4C6AE9E60D8D51BD98C9710F735
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
0xBED772AFBA257754E6059CFC2ABAFB67
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
0x3BD099C7A203DFE2E76763921168B4EC
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
0x78187C04EB0B6E344E66B478C7B9583E
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
0x8E8091833B9BAF9B3AA1DFD8834B891E
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
0x379773E317B4722D38A49B35B3BB4F97
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
0x9290350BAE355D7D60287D1EAA60BE16
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
0xF8767B4677BEE2C5E216374EFF6D0600
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
0x03BADC34D27222935656F839818EF935
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
0x7E86336DA1F27B79A220FED506B62B21
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
0x165E6E3CF3F9E0C0CAC0F7E7F0AC6664
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
0x88B7C44762FD9C07FED25E9B09B85435

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
0x9A565333B6F439D502CA77218904B192

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
0x3C07D7341EFE494DAC7D091347D0F247
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
0x8B84EC0BC1AE4A645874F98D8340B6A6
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
0x00AFBD0C1BD58C12E1AADA4DE3C006EF
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
0x66DEB0B2CD014014D45960F495057276
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
0x135E3D2A6C4897EA6BDDC9EA9EC87E0C
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
0x3A155215CA767D0CF5AF9F4503862B7E
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
0xD7B542BFD791A5BD9715AF1FB43BFA08
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
0x2EA52B6BB99D8154A2F9AE6CE2B3E73E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
0x2C34B65D5A19081DBC26D3DAB0A69B4E
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
0xB3AE96AD771E91856ABE19938B189BBF
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
0xB23D4DFC88DDEE164991315D52BE368A
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
0x0860866334957BC7DB1F80881616A693
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
0x9CF2EED70082B6E8BE26A6B11A660646
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
0xE33AB9EA669B1CB8FCDE07C4B46E071D
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
0x532A70A88F4E5688E0A229E450715BAE
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
0xEDF89A5D73D2897D765B07514BAC3799
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
0x5D6D697DC03E38359BD1225F1B965F50
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
0xA95C23EAF76BD4D7339233FD94FDB5FD
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
0x68617A1E89AE5ADA2B202F0D0B3F728D
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
0x305D54CBEC89FBC062C629392E5E9EB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
0x0E8BE1D283DD2B5C6FBF8C38C28F4E8C
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
0x003034759F854B5E1953D5AE12AA80F2
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
0x2D835D7CF4E3303297CA9E5350B4D963
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
0x99D4C909804B7A6CC4996EB8971ADC0A
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
0x4A78418802022F328843097CD18518DA
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
0xE2BCBB8998F83866342E826751F1DF8D
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
0xF84FAF372170E5C2118175DAA23F9FA6
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
0x5F92C0DCB7439585F4D5387E06F871B8
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
0x8DD3E672B5F872B7A9EF3A438BBED1BA
wanting.
0xB715C2D4AD1D26541693D1C3864D86F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
0x6C7AC0383E69F0DBACEC913763EB8CB1
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
0x69473C1A2670B5542487A1565E0584C0
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
0x6EAB7F7437219C01904B5AA150ABF1DB
curtain again descended.
0xB19EB7B232698AC95C5934388357EA3A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
0x33B3FF86398F8A39B00A7AC018437B8B
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
0x126E5C0C5CD9249AFFBF8A064684D39C
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
0xF64ECA1BA5D08F46D99050DE00D91404
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
0x08200D6A4F1B8F2AECC16A16CB808B4A
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
0xB0B56023D7BDBBBF5A173FB19818E8B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
0x7A654C2CD33438D046602F9E04855FF4
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
0x7B98953F36BB9F6EB6CB0C03631A7C8F
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
0xC1092D37900AB1C277A6C9E839D2177E
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
0xB8617D4E5A50603435978BD9DAB4426E
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
0xB7A25CE066C76DABCBD948C3E812B8A4
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
0xE19FA9B5EC45F63B217BBA0179151EC2
attached fetters.
0xB29A7D820A4C304DCDB022BFCA0A788D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
0xA583EA6BEC9FC17171272DFD34375FFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
0xCAE016EB4D2A862629D1667A5606C836
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
0x487877ECD9E107189F286DCE34C387C0
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
0x8CC38E329EF6DF2E8C22261385A819EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
0xAC02A17BDD0359E7F8C03DB2E145E8AA
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
0x8B682A14879BDDC2AA85211FC393086D
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
0x9DB2899D9CE75771CCD97A59CBAA0B4F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
0x42E36D9B6F87938A719038E1FE706E82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
0x2D60DE385A3023A7CFC0D143CB54A2A1
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
0x3B261A05128EDC97B5BFCBD8FE2A4F5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
0xF8F5AFEB0368921B6B18B3CDAE4B63D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
0xDE6711B17253E7203BFEC23799D98B74
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
0x557C46272C09A54929DCA2F8BD84A84D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
0xFC7EF425CE754925EA481AA65D69A620
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
0xC0F1FCEE58FC16174EDD3A571D64DCF3
colour rose.
0xF59E3EA307EA00897B98D1C1D8A64D2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
0xE34403541720D44FF0A5A072F260CEC7
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
0x0A3C7FECEBF470D22BBD07E21A8DD69B
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
0xF469A571F60B6918C525181C045053E5
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
0x9A56F96BF4FAFFABF625FA663EAAA2D1
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
0x604D63530BF89B272498D95760839A08
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
0xB3BD49BEF60B69BA5E1A833B9FE6C071
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
0xAF70C1EE2A7FCE175FCBA772C4C3AB70
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
0xA579637B67DE092A8CD9F27AF497599E
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
0xC2129FCD19B0D4131117AD909EB76860
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
0x544890DF18F9B1BBA48D2EDFD012D76F
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
0x7C3D32BD5AF2AB2A60B897C3C2D90D8A
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
0x6A1E0D6A65EB83D4710FA2C9D4D1B894
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
0x0F9F2504F128A3F7A0F85CBB967C50E3
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
0x74380C47600C1D0BF6E04D5CE693DC54
returns in memory at this moment.
0x09E85A969E7AEDCC48158277D9A13C47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
0x1D28D9A68963C90A2BDAB4FF02609AF7
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
0xD48828D1D78FFF1987341F85501C7F6A
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
0x69A56DABB70E6508C7C4DB06A3C814D2
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
0xC31FB012422FCE800CD687C150E7C58B
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
0x0FC017CFDCDD168245D6D85A679C7498
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
0x7495C174D90A8885F594A6D07EC9E74F
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
0x57E712FE191113924C94295A2804AD9E
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
0xCB662D7138D2A6CDD4DCC17369D5815E
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
0xD9838F6656CDBEB46D52D6A4B8C296E4
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
0x90B8FBE321BB945BB1D797699E63138E
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
0x862533F9A4698EABB6BD4DEFCEC0FFFE
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
0x0FBD8E3ED176A22A8E3FD832568FF850
very pride, irresistible.
0x4BEF932D7FC3F4026FE8B280122FF18D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
0xAFB270A0112C40D66D0FAD6AAD125E5C
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
0xAD102DFF84344131DC3B1464F026A1F6
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
0xD258E500690F60945FAF6C59BBB667FD
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
0x0E959A3B601931E8B9933ECFB4AF7ABD
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
0xC96D32BB96F9D4B95CC79A02277FD197
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
0x2391B422474C4697C0E4E92B4C7A1F1E
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
0x344F70D4725843C8261A381DCA775B25
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
0x5AD6E51CB1861106EC93DF7DF9B8C905
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
0xB53925A6351E0A0B4C02E51338FEE384
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
0x51A059A15B3DFB0617D54481010E24C2
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
0xC20026E053D4C76B041F655B2812CB26
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
0xCB789864BC049000A6895A61410491C8
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
0xFEC6A5D7E9FFDF5777771C6C5811E97C
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
0x1F5BA999A7A2429F0E57E985A3037036
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
0x2A7F746B9C796631947C50CAFB8419BD
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
0xE8B8742C6B6E7C86012366455A445507
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
0x43D51016065A0A3920D32FA3247CFB00
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
0x02991D97D3448CE96AEA7F16B3F37DAC
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
0xB94D88282F924C5A2DA87DE1C428372A
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
0xA5CA4E8E0B8F59A2928C1B0F8EA10D41
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
0xAB894358CBFF0AD22B8DC05CF313C26F
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
0x4004E524D2BE68558BBFC2FA60886487
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
0xB0C46DC1FAC1969D59ACF56324A442B6
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
0x20A8541DE3F75E5C59D427CDFC2E6C4A
torturing pain arose.
0x6E54AA1EF7912636620291F55B1D660C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
0x1F393CA2B848EBECA577B20B2E483CC3
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
0xDEF59EA078252480E91BCB5994668E43
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
0x037DFE0BD64FDFEC108489804642D256
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
0x021BE97EB784E184DC14B688AA5F65A6
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
0xF475418E6F572B45C09B65C23C2EEDC4
not charm him_.
0x93D062C7B25BA875F19E76F06E21B2FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
0x5479AF174A4B1A4EDA5095F0850BBFDF
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
0xC91524D3C1D7B869FFEB6CD3390B9535
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
0x1B5CAFCB2AAB9C0BCE3B6300A5D95FA6
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
0x3D946F9363C0F8353659CD0EA182E582
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
0x9E0AA1D58F6279AFED21C9BBD26359D7
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
0x41417A80C1C1C9204606D9BBFEFA2587
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
0xD5FFB2806DF8C2EA290B1872A38769E9
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
0xAA51AD1B239A297FA835E979A411002A
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
0x1F3C3082AF5A184C6ED7BFF5ACFD1A8F
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
0xD82642A16BEDACC9B7B053F45BFA4775
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
0x94534E5BE18ED280D7E325F49440CAEB
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
0xE3A4809F05AA1A1B5C12C4D0D494D3B2
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
0x5E02AFC7195315DA884D953FCA95A4D7
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
0x4C2D53E8C1848BE04A34A47C02C1BB58
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
0x1E084FAFBA1FABA1A85606794DE89FBA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
0xCE09170ADEA7170CC9CB4C461A09B06E
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
0xB98E9B1A219FE36546D2F69B1F5456EC
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
0x6C9A633C2F4EBD8A8243AB9560AC9013
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
0xA0A76D5335826AC7277B31C6A53CDA5B
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
0x6CB17D94CCBE8F9D61261006FDD370CD
silent conquest might have been won.
0x2D49CBD7B090854653C91780AD27C786

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
0xF0082218B01AAC6A9151DA1956A6CC86
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
0xB08DCB0FE7653830CBF010631930CCA0
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
0x826F6A7B977BA2D267F881F365833750
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
0x88061642FD6506187B5FF41B6FC1EA24
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
0x84B0360A590ADC1B4708BCAE9D214407
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
0x0D41D0F25DBD691036512D496A9592F3
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
0x321092BD17C07E6E932F1F413C93C767
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
0x5FBBCED310990A35BC8E0E5927E812B0
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
0x0FAF29B441501454038A811F3FC2FFFC
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
0xF8BB872D850B771B67044E8FF03F396B
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
0x100DF27E5D1689CD31A25CDFC8083382
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
0xC315D98301E64C82CD7E195AFF70B760
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
0xD2E04AA0136044FBA9D10196074F55E2
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
0x2CE5F6A607D2A4D3AC69DD69A668C476
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
0x6C1F354FBA4F76B5FBCFB69F5587E499
shines on."
0x426D241A60BC8C792F2BBF7E165F4574

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
0x3676D3DD943DB662B385B1C40BB3E23D
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
0xE1A5A9FF717DBE5BA4A678AEDAB4CFBB
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
0x80D0CAB6BA56DA6072D90E59C7329167
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
0x857F4792FDC950DADA9B74BF5DA1C89A
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
0x30F3DDEFFB135B01BC7C00B6AB0CEDE7
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
0x73FEEC12EE0E246E82673E9EAABCF79A
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
0x4BB0DDBBC8BAFAF8900E8746F1D85012
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
0x690F8BD7C54C0A2D00AEE6DF269841CE
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
0x1DC23D9C15A47AD50DDA25CBD307D60B
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
0x9AF092FA916B9BD13F9BD65F73E67778
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
0xABBDE78CF512F834E137EB20513EDC5A
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
0x57FCE76E4C0F38160A1FB88557CE4F30
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
0x873C4B8FD7A275AB7EB4B1AAAA207551
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
0x9A3A399B8487E679AD90CE794A3A7D94
as I wished to act.
0x3B079396E3D8FC0772E5C576E2D79F73

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
0x33F06279AF7C1D6C9194409C972CFEA2
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
0xCBBF8D2659CC268C0118F3A45551FF4D
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
0x0295A55E4ADFE911D9D2D5D3C706B0B4
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
0x9F73A35ABA0C06FAE77E792DBD4E3315
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
0x0F24B3580884AA88AAA816A848233F78
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
0xC532A103D294AD5737A57688216F6B35
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
0x3370DFC3A6D2DF2595617E328FF64229
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
0x045C2BBA61CF593CD8AAFD13AB6A1D65
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
0xB24512D9177F9353BD0D20726B6BEDE6
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
0x6771763D728B98B7ED8EED035741DD41
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
0xF1C9A49D40A24BCBCAA02FDB9488D741
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
0x9FA9399E37DB3A5CAAEBB07195842EF7
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
0x866D22AD4107FF3E47A2AD4C1CF31B48
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
0x23AE07D1D6E288D4F6D48BC0EC2A8A78
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
0x8F11B44301D9D014A71BC8F41233A67A
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
0x9EECEB3E1D332A6BA646E91154CE5D47
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
0x7177C189246B19CA9499F1742E50894A
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
0x37A27D68546726D6B19C587CB08222D8
nature.
0x4C75AC4F4C75AC4FAE4EC10D4321A3F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
0xF9D904BAE754A7B7916ECBE1D94EBCAD
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
0xC2C236DF4F3EF65DD3667422E5C1AD79
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
0x20C44778F36DEFB5E09BC6007AD35627
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
0x78313FFB5FF06C97FC7AF16F5CD84D81
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
0xCFC616A24C049DFEFAC338ACFDD1B2C7
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
0xB18D33D0C969F5297A27BF8C88BC7B0A
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
0xB809AADA27FA6FCF35AB78AE87DC621F
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
0x69B24A196600DCB71A2A6C172E2571C9
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
0x53BCF5E47AF34D306D7DBC906C68E2E8
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
0xB11951E34CC86BF0F6E8DFC57608B6D4
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
0x06F180ABE01DCD07499886403A0602BE
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
0x883136A3A0345282438555A35A3C5429
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
0xFE7CDFD7AC095257C472F4F4E72263A4
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
0xC54E0DB740F07253978F7F0B0900C531
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
0x05AA01411B3F723D404A975F70BE3A44
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
0xEC4800DA713F9E0987F9908C0B5D9D11
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
0x43C9182FF8ED15DC5565EF85FAEE12B6
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
0x867FEA63AC12D634123221F42DFC9BBA
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
0x60A895E7A5A7C0BC060B02176E42EC78
vivacity of conversation.
0x267491DEB43F46F4D29377BD92D5EF51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
0x720CF29594594FA604DF1F7FFA02628E
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
0xD8EB693E2F2BDFE880DB30111175BAEA
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
0x2EA9552F9FAAEF06EF39AC1B87896651
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
0x2DCF5CB70811BA426FDA819C2D391743
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
0xEE2556C4FDF8F9FB49B0D7D5CD3358B4
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
0xA021840F72CA6421157A7FD313488190
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
0x9DAC242C5F36533045B0EF94EFC58E14
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
0xE6DCE55FF0D0A06F75EE8A95A93048C4
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
0x3C28EB3E39203DC5C990AF1623440F54
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
0xA81C182125CAA96C7A2E8B3D5D796872
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
0x01E1DD1423E052F6D3276CA6D14B15F7
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
0x9D7F8865ED96BFCB9ED7A4B1E6956B5A
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
0x945736526DFD07581A62980040515CE4
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
0xB89370DD834DF644B244BDE745CD629D
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
0xC8D161A9FDA33DA89F6F7C66BD2EE1EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
0x224E609C34A43FE26ED4BC57AD5F59CE
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
0xEDC8EB87F7E02B093FA659AB76F185F3
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
0x752349D1B1653B1C2659ED740C9AD38D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
0x204BEBE5F6A58D2ED3AF60620083B7FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
0x344E3A5D0ED36B9572516E2129527CEF
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
0x55DF73E6B2D544411D7A89C84EE74006
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
0xA71668E25D2A404FA7943D2E1E78BB81
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
0x9244D27D92389B73A772DCFE1744D3C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
0x2A671B67333243180C24E9498EEA70F3
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
0x02759BC8513094A9884AA171FF579B53
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
0x2873CC6009165789372DC2005A786741

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
0x5A18F6059AEAA91C8F011904414FE6E7
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
0xB7100A2C3EEBF5A8B4062A93D9B4A545
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
0x8B6A1989FB3D547A41D2F3EB8CD7CED8
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
0x5E9B47CAB0A20D48B9D7CB59FD073D6B
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
0x191E55FB5C4E29D578A160632A30F4C2
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
0xECA0135D620DB1894EBEA83564425711
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
0x3E3536992C15A21255198E634EF7BD5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
0xD5AA0C84CB0B2ACCD7CCD80D9AFE1882
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
0x96CF881FFD1D245675A98536066715B4
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
0xF10E231B994C10DA989E367967B58C50

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
0xA29CB8687C2C6E68C63C2DD7687BBBC5
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
0x661DAB174A75356881CF87BDA100FAA7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
0xD60D1C479BE4654C3EF7A36020713E79
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
0x6FE9F3FC691D0D79BF1EEAF01CC79C2C
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
0xCA52E90325B46FD6DD6057F1BF24744D
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
0xC3B89CEEF4E1EE985EEB1295009EB835

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
0xFE009130F15274ECA07C3B837B925C26
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
0xA2658723162C29BF868EE4FFF04E41BA
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
0xC229F063D4A9E72AE80FF014F4735AF1
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
0xCBC4D3F576F004D9340119DEFB6786A6
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
0xACF54A5B1A9228CD4278EF910B28733C
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
0xFBEF6A6195F7223234DEE0C1897551C8
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
0xB55F5399C6907D4BB50C7EB972D44AAF
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
0xA655A71E32DAF62425F25DCC54F0D9A8
least so I thought.
0xF73665A1A1DCD2E191F503C6F7AC9226

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
0xA01BEF02A3DA0896003C0A5EA6923A49
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
0xEBD625ED1838074E0B3B603868E5D325
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
0xA47FBA95FE68ADF6988C8A389AD8DC6E
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
0x5237FBFB12627355EB08EE0961C462B2
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
0xDA1B371396919E6D4BAC1260783511ED
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
0x174697958321B3F127D8F8666D22E10F
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
0x5AD7A2C385F8942A491ED74B88DD3F04
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
0x1102E1A2CFE6E71CFBEDF246C4514FC0
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
0xB08A7DD8FA0DE6E87E5710FFF5D431E2
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
0xEE44F4743DF9673A29F80976083DEB46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
0xEAC6F99055DE26A8DCF901299D216736
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
0x66855974E1DE079DF5D1835ED2C9A16E
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
0x726459A772F8357F921B0C4BF552A737
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
0x36932CDE47B6D00F77355504BE0B5817
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
0xF9E7160CC15BC8AB5FEC7FF95248C6DF
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
0x604E3661C347CECEE325AA0D050BE0C6
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
0x83C7F33A0085622CA66F6CF4A28A75DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
0xD06E9916206BD3B496AEE6DCE0082A72
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
0x31142A777810B35CABBE44DAB7D7477C
that "extremes meet."
0x97679C2B7EEF7EB19B2AAEA634C67A21

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
0xB2958F143663D86D1CF033A720D9B779
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
0x55A9AC32A3DC3E856A4F612E3792D4BC
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
0x58A1004CB12CBDD6DB550877B937A10A
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
0xE2257A8881F7BD6B5E50A490EB304766
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
0x685E03111E108A5BED77BF467A731911
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
0x7B38CAB754FB8A85CD94E368EC8A1E14
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
0x73CF3589402AD81963CDD1A7C772BBEE
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
0x68327DCE80620EE3189015575BF796C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
0x6DEDD302E4B5E0F85352250B5975F5C7
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
0xDDD1015B881A8106F92B2DD8AF77A3C4
a placid eye and smile!"
0x3C4638429279A8029AB006698574605C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
0xBE9E480B474256BAC42B53754615DC13
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
0xA1914514200236A755ABFABEEAFC4F02
Hay Common.
0x0B6EE230EAB66E1F0395CC34BDE92DC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
0xCF30F72F88A9C02094D65AFAA4711C8B
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
0x224796BD271DB3E29D52A48520E89E85
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
0xF24F52B8C493AEE55CE4D08A6BC32090
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
0x65DD73FD6A3CEF52CE132398B96F9455
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
0x0894CE1892EA3AFBD709A6231EE9EAD6
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
0xB89C00CB8DEE977EF7F1FB1B75679877
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
0x3AB15832F801C6890BE2BDBB77D42D54
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
0xB2B7A8B14B0C171D07273D4989A4D66A
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
0x4D3CA506F2E8370BDAE075FB16A1B243
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
0xA97DC44C8E2C8F0E10B103036118ABAD
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
0x9AEAF384CA1FE14E0AE24B7FF934EF1A
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
0xEAC5CBB2FD0742FF67D396740E1A3AE6
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
0xEF5E760FE1109A2105D405C72C5A5176

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
0xED2FA3633B6A144DD67AE1E5E0E2AF02
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
0x56E7D577D02702509385C81A26B28956
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
0x735C407AD5BD951FB53E467CEB5D2DCE
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
0xE16F287CF38C6F9160075A4114D75E32
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
0x52959E5F50C0A6DEF5ECAF6437ED9B3C
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
0x215F7061DD01495A1FFF5D8D01140C20
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
0x0E157B613048F175AB0ACEAAD1FDE384

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
0x189059A8DAC76985F6EB1C4E5B356786
off," replied the magistrate.
0xEDFC1F5A032F0AE9FC9BB0C182B58F24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
0xDEB38C0459E745D47E525B724AFD3D99
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
0x6817C6C2967566ADC492BADEB7AA7A0D
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
0x158A9C0114FA12D60FFC7FC6D6646D8F
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
0xDD8975CBF0059DFC6BDE22B818768DAC
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
0x97900243D9D2613A051CE01CC26C8C10
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
0x4231D4D129BB9D6FBD7271D25F25876E
see her?"
0x926D058D1AA4D7A9A52CF28EA65875B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
0x1C7C9B3059745B3CDCB7847E14555B5F
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
0x8D67046C24C62265FD2F8C79156B27D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
0xBA64900DBC9CFF0200B9F815BE318118
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
0xA34757D2B7CFF6D5CAD2312DF64F4CE8
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
0xD4659800AD69C6BEBE312742BB42FDF1
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
0xB6EDB650394FDF4927362A9EABAAD0FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
0x3C7A3E83A0C536F72AE51ECCF49FCFC9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
0x08249453F4F84878D7F7606AF6A7418F
must and will do it."
0xA892FA76B36F65A1FE4B7895E74F50BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
0x71F1FBFDDE0B156E86B1CD65DEAA1446

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
0xA7A9A101250243141693A90E31682833

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
0x36ABAE5FA604922C2F6A8FBD3891C70B
in, of course."
0x79BF3649C03660E76051267B2ABF8B91

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
0x533C2AAFD0B839EEA265595AFE01B89A
throw away such a chance of fun."
0x17CBB452BB8923A669B9D69E0E1749D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
0x8AB542D11C43D4A1C9F9681CBA009D36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
0x83ED4F36CA646A08EEEE5D1AF94B7FF7
in the Dowager Ingram.
0xDF9DE9D8477415FCF86EF79464638420

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
0x6CFC9B5111C3D113BD8803D558816504
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
0x52F14F2F0F85BD9CC5A32F89B81F08CF
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
0x766D42D4B99E9C8091CE30D686E8FB01
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
0x1B912574C09B7ECB7E42F55B14B3192B
forward."
0x1E8167BA9CF079AA456B2FF76BC55E6C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
0x19CB50FCE235341710F7B58B2DEC2624

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
0x16DFC2DDB169B4451C86CCD7FA2D0035
Sam!"
0xE0EF77AEE0EF77AE8DF682E833BBFD58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
0x8D80548A7A273338B83E06DD25FEBE2A
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
0x0E3F0991079467F6E2D9A019C62FFB8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
0xE0AAAA2D2DF503E0E47DEDE048CA9612

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
0x5E6C4F8A5F7ACDACFB129938BAB4E3B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
0x5371E2370B2CB37BB6615180D35AC151
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
0xA2563AD7B361ADC7EDA0816277706A79

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
0x58E6EEF255A2EFC8C2F628606F0E6221
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
0x6D4A3A062AE2945390523E1944D211B7
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
0xB608A44C5648CE7F4FA27B6FA92F2AEB
one."
0x6483FC936483FC939333C78DB75CC864

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
0x83996EFB5F0E63DE7D0F118CE771B2CC
advised, my angel girl--and--"
0x8D0D20D72F64E8612D81A0D55583639D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
0xDDF5F56DC2CEF9F4944B263891D804D2
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
0x8209972258BBABCD2249E066E4A8C2A7
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
0x56E743660F482C66D4EA9C630367022B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
0xA1475BFD90A137B83EE2698B25FEE0C4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
0xC706C128D1FD98F37E636E83C9F1CD58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
0x27DAE983D99FF7132E3E6EEB45011346
once more.
0x87AF029A630395ACCA48E7FFB3B2FC1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
0x78F02FC464D87DC211427F0D68279F53
know who will be her first visitor."
0x77F9329B2F473FEDC59B99E847F7F0DF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
0xCAE99A73B057C42389FD31725DEA46ED
said Colonel Dent.
0x8D7DA3D5307C0B4BF68E6A63F29CB3A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
0x242B0CC77DBF8F9FAB01455D2C59C64E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sam went and returned.
0x3CCE1484C6B761EF38A571F3D5673810

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
0x535B4FFAA599EEBE81CB1F2C6C3044AC
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
0xD589E6183D47E68C19A24E18DD313AFD
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
0x2EC5A25355C2DB3B2BAB780F075984EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
0xC42E5F90B764354B753D56E5B47B2481

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
0x8356197ECE80040B2F7264D1C1D5DA5C
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
0x6911AA38F8DF2292943DE12C37A01221
of his men.
0xFA8348FD8D140A10BBA6225E3633CBCB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
0x30FF38BE869A131F10C52ADBBB44BE7A
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
0x853CD805E62ECFA7CC49A79681669C33
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
0xFF1CFFF96A16B5DD401FE4E313F77664

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
0xBDB3E96D25DFC805A8C8958014F08E22
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
0x5CB0DDF1A5B9CFCD7014905EF7A65D3E
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
0x23189E5D9813EC0D420D1A0B8AAE77CD
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
0xD1073838A4627DDABE69A7904494B233

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
0x4BA7C698B7143EF47934E8C7F865C00D
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
0x9E4F4F7D7AD4AE6D635A43CC25750D58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
0x635FB7DE0C0198128C6E510FAD02931C
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
0xD287C66EABF130D839831980FCCE3EB9
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
0x1205D85016AD7CF9EBBE5C237D790178
her seat, and took it in silence.
0x6475A4E05AA79E7916F3F43559D610DA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
0x8E0A8FE7CF1684C22C8DDA447F80F5CC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
0xBF53A4B9380C90ED0E20475DC9C5B0F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
0xFCD9A9CDA055AC7F19A22B345A39C45F
demanded the Misses Eshton.
0x51E16FCB35BC35DFAC1F51F2837BB518

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
0x4A14504184A197D9BDBFBBF9142292EF
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
0x7B46B19396EFA6F24D76B5F54BF067F8
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
0xF30C2875C7764AB92CC06F3D9ADD8903
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
0x99AEF10BF69F0CF7CEAEC15CF7B4928D
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
0x272B7E10CFB37A4BE7FE9B83C16350AE
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
0x4471824DFBF4C8B842C4C7BBD38C2DA7
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
0x9FD86C7B3167A38DB58E80750295EFE8
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
0xD91A7CE2CC1A1B7CBBEA88D27EA7D16C
morning, as he threatened."
0x59FF3C02888F31A407A6501D575B371A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
0xCE69C67B2D92768D11D14FD2D51F6083
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
0x914EE884B0DC3AB7FCEF955C5309B97B
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
0xD9D5C9B2C976C9A23CA99560D4CB6236
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
0xA31F22F11A139F393D3F78B363E65059
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
0x19B211CF3F26849C99D83E25B993B84A
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
0x497E58CBF2AA8F8AB493606E9E630E47
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
0x25D5E5A39D3935C6988070F81172F129
whatever revelations had been made her.
0xC1D536DEED1108302C8F65C6C3345CDB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
0x228315F132EA09DD92D183F1DD041DD7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
0x69426C32E9135E3C78A5AAAB4412CF1B
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
0xCCA433ACDB333345B163BFB3C6A8883E
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
0xEE23F93F1E69C1BDAC18B1D8EC96D5F8
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
0x9FAE0527C8D16E9B792BD801EC2FB3E8
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
0x22F536FF8DBFC72CE608A3A702B958C4
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
0xB45A8B997335B799658F7DAF6842C9FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
0x3A41DFD37692F8A11E5972B6D84E0DD2
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
0x966AF15F9069CBB5BBD9BC6C97E87B12
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
0xDF1055620AF744BCB4BEBC0F0F75FAC0
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
0x5806596BFF84A607E491DF9D7E5F75DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
0xCD968E80AAA3F11070E438FDBE0E0E77
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
0xCD16AB8AB7C4439A2C2F961D46E2DA9F
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
0x168D314A74031387F9804FD337DBCA64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
0x5B091291699F470CD29536B135B5133C
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
0x324FE8C0AFE8BF9DC71B272920258185
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
0xF544670E3A97462B6D3FF0F6A9497226
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
0x989C78464D25710861DCFFC1F640B649
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
0x4ECFCCF9826BDEF03747889122A0F922
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
0x8F0E0D1728E2775730F9E690A9AE8864
they most wished for.
0xB0F8B2397334A6E616858B69FCB993D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
0xB6549E0627AF440589B7BD081C365F4E
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
0x2FAF4E8B7314E362C1C5706713A07080
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
0xA0C7CC9FF0CCF7A09765F4D46D81A620
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
0xEE00ABFEA536458650E6D51306946CAA
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
0x85604831B2BDBD5787E3D2624433F22C
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
0xDBF486A3EB35C2FDCD4233F83634D085
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
0xE96853C62144583506E211B7F5502EE1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
0x7D4B31E18CB1C67686A967D012A46C5B
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
0x8AE5CBB1810C2BBE1B99053909803C03
saw Sam.
0x01523C72863375AF9B763E6095B4B94B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
0xCF15A9A650FCAD0F2815495CB0F592D8
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
0x67385F332A464CAC8993B34324CA1468
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
0x95AB4351DE3369B8A170F3F4BD37AD39
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
0xFB7D9F1D2215368946C49C963CCF9076

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
0x4EE7296EEC95B767339148518C50CD84
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
0xF5EC73CEDE5DAA86FB639F1C88EB41B7
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
0x080E7FBB7977E5DDF8E34A80755AE305
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
0x8FB47CDAF4E930C9E8AABD81E0C68417
quietly behind me.
0xCBE87D0DBA77E0780136D9A7F9F8C7BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
0xB57415399CFD2B0E7283A91C79365B73
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
0xB682CB7F597E6AD744FD8C96D768F396

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
0x56C6DBD9C3862CA3100C158966CC33C1
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.

CHAPTER XIX
0xF5C56B210A5579CAF7549930F68C6A11

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
0x579ADCEC9E7E467F6475CDCAADA784FD
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
0xF8C45B1CD4B3B264511509BAA57D5BD8
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
0x356693B8D6703562DFF18E8ECA7E3483
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
0xE1A046D575BDB71CCE6A04E94B227333
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
0xB7118DCD37EB50F38E52DF0B01CB9316
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
0x16B3B102DE284747C5D12C0B4B1143A1
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
0xB951384C02C7F61AAD021AEB2B3BA09A
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
0x6CC46F92D1B8EA7A4E2734444F7FE861
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
0x2828B5064BACCB7EB867FF3DE7EF2469

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
0x4E3E7C75814C8B2E672BBCCD494A39F5
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
0x3A4877436EC5583D8CED2EE98A6C465C
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
0x17E9F9740D6C96A5DCCDF582F556A15E
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
0xF12C021B0CD71F81817458D2962D51FC
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
0x26063FDA0FA40C691CA11B9B88C5CC98
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
0xA935A3FDD2C375AD5BF8C26AC9E2F08E
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
0x2ABDEE0EDF1B73F5D2BC61623EE06254
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
0x581D660CF24F737763F3FA593F3B6726
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
0xDCACF8C68018FB5D1FD74F83A22649AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
0x76B4D663A497A6EDA5A161E825DFA2A0
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
0x61B636447C042DBE76A67C5E6304A6D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
0x303964386835912D35A18EB36B0F29CD
warn you, I have no faith."
0x2856B32AEE0C4D9AC1A8D157E34F1AD9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
0x27BFAFD6F4B13E387356B54BC97292FA
your step as you crossed the threshold."
0x509B6B7E79619AD910055E3449F18D29

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
0x5E5FC2EBC336EB335CDC1F602ECC98E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
0x652454141FD2606C83D52AE5A445D51B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You need them all in your trade."
0x1A06B706B30FB1FD9ABA79C4BE845D37

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
0x1BD884461E3A089E4CB2CA18D981532E
you tremble?"
0x4B884D98AAB3CEE47623574E67F21CD4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'm not cold."
0x33403288240F7DE87A6A50C3D34836DF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why don't you turn pale?"
0x8AB30FBC0B0D89E871553EAA1A584F9C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am not sick."
0x158B32F213E62C40087BDDE9C2CE6FEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why don't you consult my art?"
0xA81336D11A54878E53EFA677AC8FF3BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'm not silly."
0xB77F0E023CB039C883A69024A0236F8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
0x5CA65FF1ADA9FE461650F74EF07AF656
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
0x592BDF8302141E21BFFD1B1246B7E2F8
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
0xC6B1AB69E53CA98C726E70D2F3F2DFCE
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
0x22515BDCD221330E5C48A6D96BD407D7
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
0x269A097EE625E309B4F7CB9858668891

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Prove it," I rejoined.
0xA633CD64BADFFEC0B4EC0379F59CF07F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
0xF95FA7B07CCA75310AB05F1DBB31BB94
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
0x00AB2BF7B7B2F6438F34C3A70C3C64FC
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
0xE4A12D3B7EC7A6D82782188282FC1781
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
0x0FD114B9B9009962DE250269A88FE124
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
0x6AE057E34BF20C2A9C79BE893B7625F7
you."
0x30492343304923433A030AD079A8FB96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
0x7DF07F71A51987016D6430665E31A3E3
with vigour.
0x0D79A6CFB766E7F6369B9FF9198CB8B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
0x9846E8922EAA167C64770E09A46E2073
solitary dependent in a great house."
0x9CBE069A3365026AFCEAE2C6F6AF22FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
0xDF132DAE6514C75D22B95B00770A4D51
one?"
0x6F457D2F6F457D2FCF1C4EC2D8EF0DC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In my circumstances."
0xC4C60AE84884595A77BD78BE2211D433

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
0x76D25AD6AA806FD589A66B262AF1BD29
placed as you are."
0x02C5F019816A83C794E1A0A949187BD8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
0x168E890FE67EE59A83E0EF3E81F014CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
0xB32837A4CFE640A16EF9AF260FD35CEB
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
0x8EC777AFD07D36ABA5463FBFC466CACF
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
0x017663DE44D477882B1748B973F457D3
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
0x0B312981D28371F81AECA9443586E85A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
0x2DC79DAF3D5427CE368125068DB7FDC2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
0xBF39AF522E687AD56AE5D366E551091E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
0x98A51452CC2C27C72D9EBFDC2FA11D90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To be sure."
0x7DD73A1B4F8D41458031EDE5AFC0E898

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
0x0D4A9AB07A2ED456AFB20847E6B31F2A
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
0xAFAD5F57C81046626D8CD86F7D586477
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
0xCE01F59125F5867A128E386C5A252D55
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
0xC0F0FE461E8D79384996A3195CF26E28

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
0xAA087B67E41C670C0404A897BC5EAB9E
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
0x64242749233E715C4450078E56FF7D88
there."
0x566664785666647833884C8A219E657B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe you," said I.
0x86168FF4D3F6FDD0A90EBD5234102789

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
0x0338FE2356A506C59021E96DC1328FF1
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
0x0AD39D1A619019B90D60D9EE89A35FFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
0x16250B5B864BFAED37FCE416C9F806F5
begin to put some faith in you presently."
0x510483636203469BF3A48E8005C0995E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
0xB3742098B537746BCAA0D2841DCC33AB
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
0x6BE0F6AACFC5A9CF8ABC5A094B72E6E6
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
0xC14D4F9F47CB17BCF99F65EF68A9132F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
0xEF637777B34E336AE5E076FEF3A48AF1
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
0xC60511CCF6800196B5555DCEDB9A2F75
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
0xDFCE9BFAAACECEE33358B1249825A20A
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
0x72331A20C035B81E4E1689C03F0CC53F
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
0x48398BC083BE9658F71C59163C606660
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
0x6EB7929DD312A535FFCABAED93F727BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
0x914E93D66845EB9FDF99684B735E62F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
0xDEF0CD66850F8782554CAD370ED893BC
whispers of the future?"
0x1AA1BBC11762C4875A031E86D222303B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
0x70C986C01B37FE132AC0D6F5C06E28DD
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."

0x8D4D3351B29AB882D410D950A62CF384

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
0x565C8FDA62443DE68AB37A2DCF714828
after all, then!"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is

Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
0x5694907FCF795FE30F870D2064E586B7
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
0xDD0A231E83FC5A34DD1B91990D0D46FF
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
0x77B2273F4D4ACEDB6A158ABB18DD4B84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
0x9A336947FC9F85F9E4CBA3A1A9FF1CB5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
0xC5DE1C41BCE5AE1BE2E69ADC80054DEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Break it, sir."
0x1DDC7F793A331E20ABD3BC44AB08B37D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
0x46C0FD759109332D8A64F5A3ED29879A
disguise.
0x59426525F35D4D01B5A2F70B766D656D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
0x5EE95C87B3BCD43D14527BE352A6D9BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But not with you?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
0x829A77BC89ABF61E23F29E6CBF61E670

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What character did I act?  My own?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
0x6412B650D4B80D841B2FE5729494C96A
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
0x20ACAD8038D990306EDFEC63F2BDD8CF
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
0x689A56276BBD525B7E42C1FAFEEB7F17

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
0xEDBCC6FA79B3973647B1C4D3ADA98734
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
0x1CB9A53DA8307E4304D5E66940176463
but it was not right."
0xB9B26362DDE40F1822B5AB23F88C29BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
0x16DA50627820FCBA64030F4EB82D4AB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
0x8AF80A2C7F1E266C7B311694DB553EBF
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
0x639501A3ADEDD8B5A580BE5D74DF9D5D
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
0x7A6C9E144B6DFADA7FB66DCA1178431B
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
0x2205DC87CD40B91FEBA8C953A69B62F8
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
0xB15CD59DCB3DB8E481212CB98413E863
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
0xD0161B7EB06521A24FC48E8A43C94683
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
0xD734D49B66A9E717F08EA1CD1D7B5C88
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
0x98ADD640D624DE547B3C46E34C4D563D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
0x4582C3936532C9192B77578D7C604FB4
signify?"
0x592A3F4E005DD8DC8E5C6C3B64DE577D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
0x3DF7EFE3C7CCF28A79FFB7E4670A8BB2
now, I suppose?"
0xF04618274C1CD145B7F44A8BEF4A3E32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room

yonder are doing."
0x87731FD8848D0CF0218586A6A51A9916

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."

"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
0x7B30BBC4A7BBFC01155E7BC9EC4997B8
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
0xC104B55833CF7122488386D73E36B83C
left this morning?"
0xE51A37A03B276744F0D4C1A4C38FB62C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x28D7CA7AEC2739AB84B26F5244AF0D3D
installing himself here till you returned."
0x99E0EA2EF2A73FCEA700E1F7F830CD82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
0xD9B85FC51F363D3A3D65681EDD82A557

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
0xD8D6899EA49BACB720225DEC05686904
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
0x5FD5515336ADD9583EF5ECC6A483307E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
0x3C3CC013EE03DA09A58167CE368A5D9E
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
0xAFEA37108D6EE6CC11361391EF70131D
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
0x37CD6F6A8E94EB4BC1461E8C322F5544

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
0x2E0A87F381057FC2B87FB5725E887CBB
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
0xC93BDB302CC6FEE74C3565DB2704C935
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
0xC9A2D4CE4BFB581D1A97F64E405315D2
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
0x129D1619DEB2F0828BFE9BF05EA13889
seemed to know what he was doing.
0xE1EBB0F423922491370373A832A8C285

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
0xC68A2AE594A21F429084BF34C395D85B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
0xDB23003D25982AF740EB84AB15479750

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
0x09CD3ADFC9F74D955A532A8ED8A0AF17

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
0xBCC29ADDCEB7ABFD19D4D4CA73A9DA89

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
0x626950EE8AB228AA74A01A85EBBBFE4A
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
0xE418D7E72B1BA87FE98934FD6D899D1D
and dreary look.
0x753080110ACDBC20B899EED18EF385B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
0x4DD83EF5FBAA152FD3759D83149D93F7
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
0x653A29EC734EE46D006B8AC8D9DD68FC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
0xE45ADA8A8C858535D53603F745DE579E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
0x37B679BBB3BB52D4A74F498C1276B37E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
0xC511818970F6148F61446ECE960B3B8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
0x68F60A37F8E67AA2F21A461F513A5656
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
0x5952E6E498D9E8206A7C0E7F1C9C63DB
doing."
0x36F1458E36F1458EAE9129C46DCCB7DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
0xA69F0C0661730514F9D2497D6043E9C5
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
0x1780110E26383C72AB21F833DAE8B9EE
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
0xAB3C4E574C7548AEDAD2B4616E6EB6F8
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
0x2CF7919B394E75A8B0511CE561C96941
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
0x2297665A1AC84002BFF717153681FAF3
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
0x173A6BF50206647E5E8C1AE6F1185F20
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
0x49B2534AC2A5CA18A2993CC69DBFB07D
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
0xA2F1E68CE70D39C4A8362E7D642AB040
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
0x76B5E59FF5A861BF4FF6B8217BAB05FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
0x73C7443F82229FE595B375FFA025801B
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
0x0DFA2137E4B0172A3C082D5705004770

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
0x54DA3CB01A210F6F827590A8E1C0FE3F
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
0x3E8E561FD0263D0A6C0FC48C3D55DD2E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Laughing and talking, sir."
0xBA5C8C2AEEA9F114708E6160BA13B823

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
0x78619BF99F81EAD3783F8BC5319B996D
strange?"
0x5E885C515E7A862122D786F6916C8A13

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
0x583A5263C7C3F86B0BB0BB0F4B8CBEEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And Mason?"
0x619CEAEDDCAB819196CFB074AAD069C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He was laughing too."
0xE32E6DA7E86DB46DBF96F5231E5A0CE6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
0x17B2D742D4FE6FC77DF9D72F22ED01C9
Jane?"
0x4F0A93C04F0A93C09CFFB8CED2453167

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
0x004C46EBEDE0E51B582CFEB0390DF2FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
0x943E78B9CEAF1AA9980EE64B93C609D4
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
0xD67AF21A0AB0E172845CDED0BCF3053C
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
0x39C26AAC3FC45D6914CC31DF3CADA78C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
0x6C4F9F5CE067D95076847AF594AD6CD3
you."
0x30492343304923433A030AD079A8FB96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To comfort me?"
0xA78BD83F4FD608F5DE26AC20FCE87900

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
0x90B783432DCC82B1CBF2151334A799B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
0x156CAB57E58D62DFAA9C37C2CF4AFDBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
0xB9B57616992E7FE2149865801CBA3A82
care nothing about it."
0x0D82F70B7E204DC0816F8486A52E30B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
0xF2A630EEDB8D58C8AD56A627A93AB7B5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
0xEE9053085E01A08EAA7C517407A7D99F
you, I am sure, do."
0x563B00CEF53AFCDD4708128B01E83BBE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
0xB7580974B8FA157421CE6C5DB61FE841
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
0x09E1B3B7BA28D98969E322B29932A7F8
and then leave me."
0x896F8B06F472DCD034E9DA0AA5038206

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
0xE2F2C551FEE56A63D29D687966461B26
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
0x20B1D7BF8D312B50DB647B1160C5B72B
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
0x74DEEE520A46E7C6B3EC864E3B0FBDC1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
0x47952FF12136FC0C3E7F63EFDF6710E2
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
0x45A854FA0C0F8A39F7100A3800619A75
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
0x0EF0C28E87F661A00A2AE6EE5376F5B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
0xADCF05DBA25140FE62E24C58F396C343
asleep.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
0x8E056E5FD00737E43F2927F9220EF5F9
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
0x4808911C6E959B7E84620BF9505A79C5
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
0xF9B200BBC7C6B629D975C5433917C40B
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
0x67CF3E39CE7000951EAB628490204E29
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
0x4C85D32C3D059CCC2318302C603F1D82
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
0x39A38B589FA433B2A98DED8259754DAE
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
0xCCC44C49E94F558CEFCEB37FDAEA00B4
the curtain.
0xF528C6D399F0FE93E1BD886BCE9C58B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Good God!  What a cry!
0xEF6C838BAE85ABD28BBA9DA656BC51BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
0xE52398D69A9B7F1EB224807F7C174063
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
0x0E0514ED3DE793C17A420A9FC9A23464

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
0xDC1D8E098AEC6E93AD2F7C4B17D14355
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
0xF1C29DB9140DE8CB296B7D8F373CD7D8
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
0xFEFEDC1854609DA3C577C508245FEDDE
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
0x2B81EB919DA706B42E74E94775E67A2D
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
0x93C47F5F8B04570C9BDF35079F74B96E
it could repeat the effort.
0x53A8892DA68B63A344236AA7AA58134F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
0x2E3D32E55AAA3725B6AEE34094EAA5D3
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
0x48B66F481E75318B1865A3D6EA73482A
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
0xBAC3F6928E4E0497FEA2B3D4452DE846
voice shouted--
0xBB1C511B5BB94840B691A21A2D0F3957

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
0x1CCFAA87CCD8EED7045EC449C0DCC9EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
0xC40E28BC035B34581ADD288A5906FF15
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
0x5B7018C408FCAD968BAD89BBDAFFB8D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
0xD48F9F1A2982C893276E27E1D05EA64D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
0xC48545318990C43AEB885A15FDAEE935
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
0xD6AC2DC158A19332183FB343CC859937
was silence.
0x0106B944FF3CBD3099779B58FDD452D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
0xC4828F0BDB18CA2BA6ED1292EE514C41
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
0x5A29772BDCDC088370CB1FD262BF31B7
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
0x928FBEB1AE2330D0190A88501FF54CCC
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
0xBD1339D97F6999A62660ED6990AD9A57
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
0xC5B79BB038E67091D7D81CAB3F0CE1BF
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
0xEAD02D69224792CD6D151D8702357DE2
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
0x6C3EAB1DC4632671631B214602B24E02
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
0x9C63F4E7ECE3F44600403B9A8C55D6BE
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
0x2500B002839DCB0B4C605C590A334C6B
confusion was inextricable.
0x01455C4E2415B22C22662AAB8EDA5AA1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
0x7A7F36280490B5180BD8417E67420B80
in his bed."
0x946D6364483AA108E8731145A2D3F75A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
0xEE7C450A220CC767C55E0E78707C5C52
coming."
0x561C323E6E0A698426EFADF8BA40A1CC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
0xDCF625D555B32ED5EF8CFC0B6E66B308
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
0xF22D926B35645F15C2805586488EC20E
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
0xEB0F5BBE8C00CD7EF961863A1F052CC7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
0x7C50E66121EFE5871B0ABE023E3AAB0B
worst at once!"
0xC722A59C1B02947D17167D670807A353

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
0x20222409DABBDBCD4AAAFE4F7FB908DE
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
0xF03F2682B04283EC9532DC62377FCE09
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
0xB784B44AC9248772F738CC1A47359F20

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
0xBCDA216BBFB3BA21006E6833E17824F4
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
0x5D36BB8F4ABFE7A974CEDB75245498EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
0xCC27E6B32098E425C00D121DAAED340D
by an effort, he added--
0xD0FC3E38B729FD6D07AB2E842F4AE351

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
0x0CCE871E52C46C3862C550569947BD08
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
0x790773C972F1CD650C6AC6AE1D6A1A3F
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
0x660CCB3D130EDAAB06B3CD081134047A
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
0x9CA701CAE292758442A924DDB49D7AFA
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
0xD7E3A7D44BA8C6ADF2604508E8B4CF2F
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
0x6CE02E3476834D059667546499C0CE74
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
0x3F4CC2A115D38608F6CC1C4E99D60A47
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
0x5AE84DD401E8779CC4447DB2B4F05D15
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
0x44ED25F2ED9DAA8BBDED980A04827E47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
0x27D753325B9786250BA79080CB8A5F6E
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
0x16E6CDFF69D1C7E9221BD6C74D35058C
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
0x37B95F2E9928EF42AFBA772094DC748D
had left it.
0x0A3686C3312B511787C5B336DA115AB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
0x5FAC5079671DA26DCECB84F7D71914FE
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
0x7AC8CC9548C7E7045E8DC0797D76436F
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
0x7454DAC917028F2F71D12BBE6FFFEFB8
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
0xC2E59623830FBF4376DD74524EBA61A0
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
0x3FBACC1F2F9D66AA886CE6F7517C78EE
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
0xCA00AC1665DF48F028454BF8ABCED2EB
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
0x505AB73A903B3F4FA8F285999ED9E3C3
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
0xBCBE760CD868FE31759C787C8B607CB7
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
0x1CDD3C419C624ABAC53A9DDAD3E877A2
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
0xE9C2CF117B3D0E937A5B3B3679154AC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
0x9DC6AF7698C432270347EB3C57DFD523
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
0x28E7577729B13F8C6EAF0D168B73C721
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
0x5C7055F922C95317BF93A46F5428C4C4
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
0x17C1B7AE241949DE4E3678CD87CA594D
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
0xB3E74A0CDCD9F45214056ED23F277ECD
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
0xBC3547071C6CB9E24C47AF0B5E5E0E8A
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
0x5250F575B38E48BB063A279897058A24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
0xBE7AB872F03D2C85C102D9B892898825

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
0x0DDBC2C295FE2820A78F5B2EC851A003

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And dressed?"
0x0827090E962AFAD5E6F382A3732B5B3C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come out, then, quietly."
0x7E008CAEE75E9698EC25D462AE0D7896

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
0x86DB4BC523F5B67F42F9A8E465503757

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
0xBC11ED43CB96025D7F8ADD7FB99CA895
noise."
0x749A0393749A03933F668F7C1D825FEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
0x8CE982AA36F12DFAB31CEE008837B82F
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
0xD592391265B78F36DC6A3E28DD27C0DC
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
0xDB0774161BCE7F88DA5D3031993C6615
side.
0x55F0DF9F55F0DF9FEC573AFDDE003089

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
0x065C7A78ECE672CAA04C5BB3A9694CEF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
0xE3C4A2CB1385805CD6759F413CA2A4F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go back and fetch both."
0x74BB76948DE23A383E0138FC2B0363F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
0x57D6E45CCA45862977BB28E4267EA556
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
0x7935D5FFCD54ECB980C3751F2F0F3C0C
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
0x1E854268F6DD4F98052329D4D62FE8AE
he paused, and addressed me again.
0x7DCEFF5A2B56F0076C92EE780B8B01D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
0x40BC14099097CA3E14E554C2C1A07C0B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
0x64DE0BAFEF75FCDC6253A25B10F306FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
0x5E7355C4A1D36E8AA308BC4E16E0BD4E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
0xE18C1AC1C34FA3EBE0AF9A9B69A59DF3
fit."
0x685862AD685862ADC2368F9DF08F6395

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
0x5752F8FD8643914479EA3527C422ECDD
the key and opened the door.
0xBBAB87D37F5C65008CA8B3354123D152

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
0xA4E4C9099B564F4029C051158FE44B09
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
0x52FB6917171D469F447C2C916B467046
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
0x9B4AAA73AA9380CD2DD0BD9AFAA6ABFE
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
0xD4AA857D5765F29C76DDE7BE53B7B14E
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
0x4E5C579DB275DA6084518E8FDB517F22
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
0x068B7DFA10D4BDFC7D3D2EC79708E0AC
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
0x4E7932CB482240BDBFDD5F0A4F0E91CE
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
0x5D9B4D2B012B36FADE44A9A460940BE0
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
0x80E45792BF6AD0D5CC0616BF9080FD2E
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
0xA38568F3DE8AB939BDBDBCD8A896FE1B
came out and closed the door behind him.
0x9402F2DFD4AFEDBDD9B5A09C18DD8F00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
0x02DBC2B960F68712AC20873584C2A85E
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
0x707002FEE2459B85BE8E840BBE5200D2
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
0x06D1A8F3E99FE0454D588C0872CB132F
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
0x8B521F7490691CD614F6BEB1DD3FADB2
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
0x3C794C390A35F5ADB4EFBBF8A217CB8D
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
0x45957237043528DFE84B38CC7BF27160
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
0xA6D4FA7F2D17D1BEF005397B75B33931
blood.
0x522ABA0B522ABA0BBBD2CF5E5EE4214A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
0x97B837F49D2A8557A26C6F80CE129A2D
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
0x318235A9850E7FE92F7AC49731E56B41
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
0xB662B422BF0ED61D310A27B333BD71AF
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
0xDDF36BAC1D144D79DC747B5950A7B849
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
0x710E071C29CC73D38EB773690C37AD5B
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
0xD96CE36A7D4E850E72D1CD39954F2F78
blood, trickling fast down.
0x8D5263324758391B43C185AE847B492F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
0x1BF3032A27355960AB4E4CF10E028EEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
0xF0556C9993A204995677BCF48258BCED
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
0xCDD304600585AB860041374B434E115E
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
0x7C0AFCF43E93A8A86FE339F742E133B3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir?"
0x12A8B91112A8B9113E8C9A2A57A0968F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
0xEDEBA659D19A6BDDDBEB62358158433F
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
0xE080B90EEDB41C72843755915E07A39E
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
0x839F2591FB2AA94D082DF176E018A347
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
0x558633AA56F370DA668F4E37BCC7A094
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
0x883C35044845842856060093875D95B7
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
0x45510B0FB7CB136E1BA5A8D5FD6FE62C
consequences."
0xB771EDBC3DA22E0B0F2D7C29A7737DFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
0x1D57C05D2093B430EA3DA488516F13AC
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
0xAF965172C39C09A7752EB3ACEFBEB57A
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
0xC73D0454DD046AD149DC47AD3C27945D
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
0x43833A562AE50F0F051DA0978800EF90
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
0x596EFD0F4204F347FC484D7983A891E1
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
0x92C1EF8FF5FEE36DC11C5F944A5091FB
step ceased to be heard.
0xC58549378DFBCFDCC0AC62FB5B446696

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
0x42A82F2280D5E62397C83E0AECF95EBE
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
0xD54FBA28CA53BFF4494312EFF85BE5B9
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
0x0ED82AED457EC4A9C5B5CDB1027A32A1
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
0x5A45A58C41C3C6294452645BA95DC30C
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
0xAD219C3DEE4130F282051A729E0F895B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
0xA8A47CC8C382D9F5386C647D8B0C61A7
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
0x5B15F1D6FBFD2C0F9F7BAAC7EBE66F4F
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
0xB72A0C7252188ECE5CB5993C46A5AF63
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
0xA2384E32FED9AFF2B0AB2DBFA6759BCF
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
0x04A7692399DCBF9A1917EBB6E7021EDE
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
0xF3070099C208931E1C3393E5485E0C2A
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
0x50CCFA191D0D8F2377BE9E892A408256
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
0xBBAC22B0178AEFA21DC04F06D30BAD7D
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
0xF30A236B0618F0CAEE1A1609D791B253
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
0x09DFED004A899AB0D66AB4B2B739F32B
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
0x647D8F18FC4BF0D6859FECC48ACCEE85
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
0xBAC5C5BCCCDF475036CAAC9A229812A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
0x130A99AF2ED06BF9640788AFDC538FBD
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
0x93FC1D132FDDB4C0492133FCF7554F5B
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
0x70D09CDBE1A901791002244E3038380F
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
0xB9940DE003BD1C921DEB47713DBC6785
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
0x2DF5967583BDBA02FD32696ACC7E4866
subordinate's form.
0xD1C7D24DEDE3275730B5DD4DEB298B7E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
0xD3E68435B7107682EA2FEF8B8B886CB1
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
0x2F3540D07B5E0B20D41BAE99F3C935A5
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
0x62CE19AC8BB35ED52B2D04E2BC087BB6
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
0xB5E62E62FAC692689C8F3993C06B56E9
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
0xCCA98E11C135ADE735BC5A18CEC4BC9F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
0x856F7B8AB98F0DFC2BFBB97CA07E55EC
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
0xD10564337FCD43DBF798A8D8913077F7
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
0x959B52A65188717180AD207D3C52792C
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
0x4BC8C3CAE9927EA070D5EBF020CA522C
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
0x95088213AF58CD662C6D762365D3F5A2
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
0xBE8BD941F5268A41F91606796F9F5D1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
0xBF25752B2A38321409C59153A24909F6
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
0x08150016F5467FF966BEF3BB6499FA81
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
0x1B8C303AE7AA71F70F65671BB4866612
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
0x12296C1D9B8A85B28035CFE6D9985B6B
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
0x970CA3287EEEA9DBE8BB104ADECF2C49
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
0xE542831A95377F3C6F5900054074EF70
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
0xFD353436A28DB0D61BA3D5F64CE66277
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
0xFF01ADD5F4C519633F8FC142A2F22503
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
0x13CA8D47632495D89324ADEC974A018F
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
0x4D4D8C3BFAFEAD012AC1FFF246080F64
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
0x9D548A685C8002BD6CC726FB469494FD
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
0xBC9102FD60419F993E4C27D60D1662BB
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
0x498C8CDD48DA1484789D9A9B8E7D20A2
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
0x16F3CE3E09B24D0CEDE0D3943D0A6098
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
0x39E89976EBF6093625DCAB7690FE934A
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
0x65D915808E2E31938BB8CFC33D021D58
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
0x801B60383845D6ACBAF5EC083CF63C45
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
0x156A6251184E5115BF09DD009A262163
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
0xA5608042D53107F6D8104772350FABD0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
0x2F2107C0F3A06EC483D55527F5D43010
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
0x86A552B1DFA0BF8B62463BF347AF00E9
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
0xE2400AAC15AB190726E4A27ACC773F6C
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
0xD656FA1E50B2AE70F0C04C76FC7307D9
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
0xA47D30A70BA9F27A7844982F205FB1EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
0xBAD23DDE1C0915601CE4FFA51F79E73B
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
0xC751BFE3A85DFB6C1D1E7DA29BFE9411
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
0x5A6D60ECC7C1D2792DC66D5EB8E34B8C
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
0xC958FF5899187B6B0DC2A31EE542D724
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
0x67D98F2D50B8B702588689D30B60455C
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
0x128F4BF427B0BADC247FAEC1D144295C
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
0x6BF0700D49C890E7386AAFAE16F3044C
I might not even speak to him.
0x654559381A72CACBD9647930E54D286F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
0x3B35DDB6BDC63BF081176C588E0F733C
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
0x0C9F9F1FC5872EE42B5351910C1A5AA8
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
0x44DF01A272149F1F61FEF2EC778A54E6
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
0xBB665E388AA69CF3BDE6AEC725921586
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
0x93A1CA7E29D6A014306095F1F59BC681
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
0x7EF7B87025919CAFA53B56CFB17FCA2D
shorter.
0x8563A01BB70BFED703D2AE2F08F1AEBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
0xC7B399F55FE7E1BC3D1653E36351E5E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
0x074FD929D79CB6772B0EF1F46B9CF3EC
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
0xA5C8F6DF3A1CF30E1090001DBA00A109
patient downstairs and all."
0x7D0AB79F218EC5AC87CEAC06098E1C92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
0x0FC79E82EF4EF84B4F8E1CC1C7E84F8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
0xB9535A80E59ABB552E6B8F1A43E7850B
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
0x6BE56B73B85E475E8740D9DECA7A12E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
0xEEB4D661ECF901AD6A0D170CE8226DDC
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
0x02D1F5A630533DF474A16E1C430DFA01
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
0xA4E3DFE3446932A53251E55FF2D45F8E
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
0x04FB0299E107FDC5CEE8AB65322C45A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
0xFFDDA1F51A557C264DD4B4C3D98D98F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
0x90A5A23FE06F3CF10A589581DB59AA66

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
0x026EFE8C3DA5690F62CA0DC6DCA5D5FD
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
0x4C8CF7DFBCE1ACD6FF8EF1C43677A521
there's no danger."
0xDD3CB0D9ACA66E64E0A316B5B8238BB3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
0x6CEB0A92EDA613DCA1C315FD9F1ECC72
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
0xC65FB58349AB7B9C6A5ACD42584F70F1
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
0x9B70AE72E6CC1C153477432F39D78FF0
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
0x53D2D1D8F150A43B3464286A1FDDFDD5
here!"
0x137B2DD9137B2DD98DF767B288167929

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
0xBB1F0650C146B7FFC2CBA26B70DAFCA9
Rochester got the knife from her."
0xA7B5E5238AD703C0B691ADCA7D9E6377

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
0xCE6E9D5C96AE4092B0FE1DEB669FAF3B
said Mr. Rochester.
0x716E18384DE08DC8F0BEE00F3A71C8EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
0x8765DB0AB4356B5BEEED2F6B5A88ED6C
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
0xFD1BC54D6C2EBF5F7A3CC0892F2C6D2F
looked so quiet at first."
0xAFFF74E24818D9186F6E8041C99800AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
0xE6C1FFE0633E8EC4FCE219787C0231F3
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
0x8CFE7E13F2868F6774D1C439DC0A36FA
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
0x87A42EA512E9E8C56351B16EA5373326
alone."
0xFEB86AFAFEB86AFA77B3ADB1FBE14C51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I thought I could have done some good."
0xD6FD8CFEC9F51FFB0CD21148CA975D44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
0x626C4066237AB9949BF2ECB0AE48F798
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
0x053ACCD4920ABFD5BF79A794D5A07540
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
0xE955084733F791E64BE7FDC3DD93A2D0
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
0x4C4CF330CE84CCEDA3C9F469C2AC7B37

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
0x51A206A4F9E58C22574DA7BD67CFB25E
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
0xAD6D0C17E7EE6F905A71F8E814DCE83E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
0x2AB187684F840B725AB117D6F98BABFA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
0xA580F1DAE1716E143F395C7C1F2CD6E6
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
0xF07A2111074E9EB47CECE6AD0E6ABDE9
said--
0x86CA0DB586CA0DB5502F29F4A081027F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
0x728000A42BB5455C6F1661F5E8EE01A9
it."
0x3EB6AA8D3EB6AA8D351AF11FCEE4B621

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
0xAF598E0733FF62CA4A4CE123FCBBA7EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
0x8C8BBBF3C6BE148F043AFA0835FC73A0
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
0xF1D56B8282BFD5BF58F67C394B376518
think of her at all."
0x658DE733D227B7AF084527F20C2AE7A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Impossible to forget this night!"
0xBB6C56A34DB8F07D7924D578C2FB0A90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
0xFB718D1D6C13C21B27A5C90E195A2A8C
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
0x471DAC24DFACE3D87BE64189D0CEE2F7
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
0x61B855319E0BA6D224CA8F84EC401208
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
0xABD1DA810CA74C522431DE840191E056
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
0x080E8DE17141CB30E8CE5ACAAEF1CBC8
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
0x1A5EF8A87221D665500FFD1E812143EE
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
0xD0EB9FCB8C4FFD4A377DA2F4E0152B4C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
0x53F9CAD5D2F802B2243B9A29BF89FB64
and returned with them.
0xCB80576D99CB2D90A1473E00E783CE09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
0x5389C90E02EE66E1DB788314B269F899
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
0xE7E4D1241B11EB7395A8DEFA3DCC619F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I retired as directed.
0xADCEC39849AE9C9F245402AFB2786E26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
0x2FF6DB99940C64FB9D4836A96E096E7A
Rochester presently.
0xA8D70A999EED6E70D399314E11131A53

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir; all was very still."
0xFA525A5B92024BF6C6342EF7847905B5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
0x6CDCDDDC2EF846EC42E4AAFF59461FBF
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
0x6D628787EC3B6F7287609FB04F563DFF
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
0xBA4FD9CBB30BDD49F75FAD58E0BCEFA2
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
0xD19FADCC93848756884A63E036FB7A66
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
0xB47B53B5E30E8D95BC1FD1C3BD03B0C3
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
0xF8F8EDD98C32CBC8A83EB4E0A5FA0042
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
0x94705113B4F78613A04F288990176C45

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
0xCCD6FEED2BD044A095A704F77CBA5AEF
edged with fur.
0xE6C6FB7F6197148618ECD699F3AE919E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
0x12C7A29EDB76226FB127B6B4F1AA7F65
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
0xA28CC8F4AC8DDCDB012B7D3D38F54C26
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
0x7AE500FC85FE8AFC2406D1B88DE84E63
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
0x828C45B1C840E57835A3062D2605F792
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
0xF72BA943618EF72171CF2B9DBAD951EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
0x11BB15FC1060E1D2DA4E03F6888AC64A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
0x7A0AA8D6DAAEF9FB5A863B4DF30895D9
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
0x335FAAB419385546463792617B3530D3
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
0x7364B8FD42ED53BBB409E177AB325668
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
0xCE93FEDFAD05858AA5FAF8E469C8B958
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
0xB7CE156206FF3061FB0405F6E67E6FF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
0xA194ABEB7C63C2CDEB31B490F6355F2B
the washstand.
0x84C00FFFCBCDF6781B00ABA242B3002F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
0x856F72A858497907B7DA6D28AF223BB4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
0xBBA9AB9909575FE7143B7D9EAD9B0ED1
to Mason.
0x5B1361D1E70B7242981F46D630D15AE8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
0x6EC453D0B2FE1F107DA3B8571DBFA35B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
0xCE75DB64D545D9CA3FD30DDF003BC39C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Drink! drink! drink!"
0xDE77A7EB9A3948581D827786EA6A4A45

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
0xE50CFBA26896D11080CA0262DC4939E8
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
0x5D22425A57D089DEC8B39D49F7A17757
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
0xCB8ABE39012EAF8950A4DF260F9A12FF
liquid; he then took his arm--
0x2A8E030A51CC69B4C22F129CD59FF9C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
0x7DF11556286C107E5915D01251DBACFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The patient rose.
0x1F0890A294E86F87F5FBA35531068C7B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
0x20E6D2CAA939C3D9689E2F5D6EF8125E
step out--that's it!"
0xC4E34E734BCBAAB370998E961EB0DD46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
0xD2C04FFD30F24576C6CB6B11AE1EE1BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
0xD96A222ED597486E5872DF5DD555BBA7
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
0x82EA51E9C868C645A293CCD88DCA3775
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
0xA21138E5DAD3A3344ED2688FE3FE7073
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
0x20060BA21AEA33F662F72062C30BE977
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
0x7CED78FACBDBBA4C731805B116561B35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
0xCB697F7A13502051A935B232814C055F
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
0xDC6209B37EBF8ED5D0D44F3B18F9D2D9
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
0x49657E1F7A8BA7259F9C239A2AC3168D
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
0x0B8355A24722AC85FDB28E038C77D66A
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
0xCE1AB478605598A43557B8E9190694B6
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
0xEB6D43A9962F0BA064074EB61EF0DDEC
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
0x9CD8E9ED351193DB6725160CB2CF541B
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
0x55C1A7F226D4C27A4F418D2324BE1CA2
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
0xC630231E3521A4245AF29CCCD343970F
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
0x2CA7209532F6209CD517EF18B9D383DB
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
0x687D6CFBB75A13F41A3645D20761797F
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
0xF14E896C68FA77744E90F89B5A029123

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
0xA5E56DBA89A10D8B7B0DE90E6542C321
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
0xDA81D973FEEF0575C8256EEB6B9D7A6F
chaise; Carter followed.
0x11F2CD1BAF9D1224AB5080E7D2655D2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
0xB95E4DBC0E92414ADADCE06247F8286E
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
0xB9C10B95E3607BA543BA2175361FF52F
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
0x187F267A8091DAF40A5230CD49F4A292

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
0xA56A0591590D5B3A3FE48DF1EB323846

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
0xAA80F7D110A28CD6A0C6366049E8A482
Dick."
0xC205FA58C205FA58757559D1366CDC4A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fairfax--"
0x8AB2268083C1E76BBB032FFF5C1DDD5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well what is it?"
0xA164F279CAE7AEDE7DEA7502AB0059FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
0x37608E234AE275CFB764FCCA106CC2EF
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
0x719C8561B8B2B0ECAF8C66B9D171B3E5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
0x0218A16394C827D9A75E4F2607CF0AFE
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
0xD9222BBE0BEA188B1EFEB05BF29DB5DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
0x27F1EBB96DACB53FC8A3420B07C5CB5E
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
0x4172875382A7908DA82F135B1FFD06B3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
0x6C1C7ABC930507160E4678A1B552FEC1
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
0x1D631C5E6AAA586B49B1475AFD2C894E
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
0xFE7ED2D0F39EEC13BC0AF432CA5401B2
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
0x2FB414645F0632A68A808CB2CDA2DD89

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
0xEAB541A9067136B5A96A9A2EC2BD0624
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
0x6425AB85EDA5844712BB520172B8509E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
0x6C961FD8DDD68A3BA5DDB950B54D97CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
0xAA18C3539635DE0DB090B31DC183155B
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
0x2311F6203A8E3AD1052473AA85D40821
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
0x99CB5E920996455824ADDEA461B3963A
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
0xAF2C0464EEB63CA3F066CCBD3540ACC1
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
0x501DA166F6B35331D25F16739AF93AFF
pure."
0xD752CF83D752CF832B2F3BB7FE52F182

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
0x5AA48D9A245CA860D0EDA8102F6B609E
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
0x0C972C95A9AA0713391DABA4CC1833B2
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
0xA683ABB89C5DA1B8F6366F9412BF7EDF
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
0x3343DACDBA619ABB0B8A7C96FBCEC68D
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
0x9B449AEB001EAFB6668D9CE61141F703
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
0xBA79C26191F3AA82F98E44EB6EF7EACE
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
0x5E915F1DF1A398BCE9F6666236505334
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
0xB8CBE180A01783150D87FC7DC52BB9C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
0xBA1B3E9FDF347D7393F8A38131A1A2C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
0xAE3ED6D5D647CC5C01C27C6F4F80957D
me.
0x4E106EDF4E106EDF4E106EDFFCA050BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
0x46F7A31EA478745EBDC77EB7C23C9CD2
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
0x9B37D1B834E22166E879A1C44B92F4FD
atmosphere?"
0x0CCE44E5EB195A42B1018BDC030E3BBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do, very much."
0x242EC1DF0DA3F4D8BB44406BC17FB2C4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
0xD6E9B2C088E0B110BF114761945C4A19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
0xA0DC9C6EE93A583D7A80CE3025DB2A8B
with Mason?"
0x9D81CAA3E245B69CA8B9B2A6FC59614A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
0xD3831DFBE5ABB641FCD71DF974FCC478

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
0x116EE747D39476DFA6FD4146693DABDE
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
0x5330A5239AFB5A08E921091B15F84C0C

"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
0x9BC2A4B92A4D351902BAC5DCB123F171
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure

if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."

how to avert the danger."
0xBCF801C19CE81C86F33D20C18DA4B1B3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
0xCA910588F78E90A061C8419570D7D7D5
from him.

in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
0xFF15B4516C066261A221BC0A96F81245
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
0xE63937E393BD3C6224BB1CBCB6BCF746
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
0x09FE398111730C778962079E33B718A2
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
0x5BBE1E28F07F0B64BA4A10B11EA7793B
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
0x4B9CFE6DDD8D552F5001BEFC0C594900
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
0xB234BFF57136180F651B476846736E6F
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
0x775F6FE333C01344EE16D1BCE4DE8E07
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
0x0C244B9CE9A33CC22A483E5FDC876664
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
0x995762E1AA3C48270A18F1429941B2BD
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
0xC632E50863C24FA5232554699856B24E
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
0xDF18F6AD79B5F0823E42AB97A0C689D8
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
0x351A0B22324AEFD5B964144EFE1A82CC
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
0x27EDB62D7FF5510BA002347C6E082950
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix

me at once."

"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
0x874568000D99577CAE29D7B9D4B23B72
you are very safe."
0xF80E88807245226277C93790DD617A3A

"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
0xCEAE9EA4BDCDE0E2C235CF1A1C3E320B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
0x54B06779178AFA98CEBC094FC338DF0A
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
0x66DFF4EA876BC1AC1A93CEC0CDB93746
before him.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
0x3C6AC4051842D9136DFF4BE0BA88C3C8
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
0x23B55B71C927E91D9D53D66FA8DAB97F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the

flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
0x0C2433D7C8E8EAF0DE87DBEEFCD4625B
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
0x8C678DD55415ABEA327E9D074039E870
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
0xFF3580B863AC46F20D0F9BC481C4BC12
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
0xE43E7D5563A76598176D274421847F28
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
0xCB77E78468DC603D458506AD6902A185
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
0x3C5DF765DEC317ECB06E97A96385C421
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
0x1FA6BA23DEE87F8BD6F9BDCD5B794D5D
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
0x8C63381C5B04C514805CDEF2F9F69F09
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
0x830852FD40E37620E184A54A0110BD4A
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
0xA820943E9FEA5206BB5CA1B01E25BC5D
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
0xEE92FB585B844FF3A55446D1B48723F0
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
0xD4C282D3BF67942D5F76A672D626521B
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
0x4428B2C405ABF80EB38470DCC76CE32E
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
0x163B2B2D896B09E00ECC683BCD22B606
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
0x6C90B9D885D384110ECD0EC2DF42AA8B
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
0xB64687B237FE417218424002EFA667F9
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
0x61E842CAF7F55B6FE8008A7DB666EBE9
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
0xB1BA558F7F7F320BA57E1EE848D508DB
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
0x95A21CEB233859FAC3C6685C3A04C851
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
0xA5050E1699639BC14A0D9E46016926C6
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
0x43F7FED78838B73A73EA7716DB068F88
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
0x73DAEB6C63A55F5051DCD877F27D39CD
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
0x842A6FAD05D529F14061275AA93A6B1E
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
0x4D93C9994F0197BFC1A7FF84E16B8589
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
0x87B40988BF1D804F5DDA6286220FC080
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
0xD11BA7C4CB69689E41655567F4A826AA
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
0xF1C4C2BC90B0B494812353CC8CD83398
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
0x14D0209821BDC897D158A8F68A71962A
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
0x146DFF1FEF0EE4DB44012935AC4252B8
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
0x66B586C6C4DCAE397EC007EA3D292179
judgment approves?"
0xB02F20F143B4A92738AD91C88E79744E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
0xFB140E7940087A10F1D86BAAF03D3982
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
0x1EC079455A7354FAF4DD3D76460491E0
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
0x55E8EEF737A2686F0A82B08B7CF777D2
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
0x022C19C6799233A21956080151094440
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
0xFAD8146F455F24B42EB2B5270A319B95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
0xB74C62AF4B06EB8CB77D73D2579FF3FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
0x76970429ED765EC33AA3A946D6D509F0
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
0x554B801D3F8521C4B2D5504ABB38437B
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
0xC6DC1B6F9B38E18BECBEA02FF0D60003
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
0x0B394262F8ADC06FDFAEF786491CCC06

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
0xC0D49106846E3E52B9C2FD02D7B72D2B
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
0x6FEC49CDB80CA8C9F685C2E104B6B03D
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
0xBAA59F5A392CD234245D46041A0AF44E
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
0x2B6426CCCDECAF997655BAE40E3EAA78
amend and solace to heal."
0xAEE1DF4DD7B40F51E64110F8449FB20D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
0x684E96E6ACB617F9C0DDE2182B44236C
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
0x0D980C4953F9836C7DC1720A3EC4061D
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the

instrument for my cure in--"
0xE168252A3414E0E5E350DB2B14850289

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
0xF2F357A3D3F8FF20A0FF36A9C53C9D4B
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
0xB7487F326EA4BA681EAEE61E95ED0E74
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
0x4C0E064B788B69B74365DE95434168DC
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
0x6149B9814D716994EA13620344C8B884
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
0x45F370B24AC29ABE0CF6D11B1B48AE49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
0xB03E854912FDFB353633B92060A8831B
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
0x1E662FB04EB46B54C28AEDBB150E7724
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
0xC0F71BC710991E17F6C5BFCDE2D325C1
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
0xF23CD42D90306ECA45A565C111687E85

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
0x2E731158FC49D823233E3D94EE06499E
came back he was humming a tune.
0xBC815807561A354D7CB682E7CE753224

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
0x8FFFD1B9FC3B98895C44A60031A78FB0
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
0x9D1B232D044661AC0A84A1737A45A048

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Curse you?  No, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
0xCA772D2A53EB7AE925EFB89C00B2B034
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
0xA7C716D3CABD39166223F0824BA1F4A7
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
0x7D45FBE166913178CDA0906084B2A8A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
0xC2C3348B307F6AFF6599077A0A9765AC
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
0x3B4C55BFA31E9B699278C0F38DF0DC1D
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
0xFAC19A06C308A34E7428E242E828C156

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
0x05187FF14BD83F530205B30AFC9B1D65
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
0x123AD9659B423D12B8057106F4D70837

As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying

cheerfully--

"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:

CHAPTER XXI
0x9B49BE30F803B1610F17DE0BD1817C5C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
0xD7224739843A47EDA4152F672368A3BD
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
0x509D4249265F941EB9A20D8649AC1BA8
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
0xB6179E44FE64DFF3CCBED70C07668198
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
0x24775B60338B76C93F0106A3689183B5
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
0x64408BC4C547C395517A1D091D1ACB31
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
0x4CCE0F979BA0831C3C1555E6F855DA82
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
0x1677C6FECAC9AC8CAD615C20B0425C07
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
0x98E31FD773114BDF5D5DAA7E344DFBEB
man.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
0xC03EF1881E1BC6530253DC1C0E4DBEC7
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
0x8E18323E208E3758E0252B483E2D0CD6
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
0x1F2336A76F71C45D52C9BEE7A4A091E8
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
0x18B982F86B622F98CB5D1FD43B3C37E4
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
0xA8706C107897C87545BC7B8CB6114A41
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
0x74A5C2FAD2FE3B351201C40FAABF0E3A
little sister.
0x8DCD0C79E0F245E229D024CED92CFE3C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
0xFE47061C3B0C6E5F2ACAADCC30AFEB6D
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
0x827FAA5A7369A331BACB4DF4CDA36F52
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
0x8478A80D99990F7457F684A4AF41D488
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
0x646D8C11FC1FE00BC8F79F5CD3E4070E
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
0xF3B31A42DF47B6D49154A2ABF061B6B1
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
0xAAEB5DF40FF9473F290A64DF065F2FCB
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
0x5890CD31BB3EF0803EF90D45A5BDAE76
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
0x04B75717FC098F5069164A5B797893FE
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
0x17FE73860877DA4F29267DE8D3073004

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
0x13AC1534D6661D792D1FFB5C037D04C9
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
0x4F95977F9B88700354A1F7A94A0DD15C
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
0x0C7664481BA9EB31C6D802CD063EFB90
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
0x02C4DB65E1E49E755C952A6316BD7585
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
0x28A19BF93BAD3026757483EBC773C7B6
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
0xDDC6A2FD539F0C56F859A7CF0C6C6241
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
0xECD5EAE894F80416F557B54AFDBE2B53
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
0xAAFE5A88994B78C0019AF89D8766EBC1
was surrounded with a crape band.
0xA0E6A9897FF1EF621FBF831C4E545D88

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
0x1C66EFD959CCFB4E4721333C1BDC08C3
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
0x60C0A30EE1401CFD54079349A3B479D1
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
0x932025A318DE07C06F93FE017879445B
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
0x7C8A2275A1E09A1498FC38E7C692FF45
are married to Bessie?"
0x073180EBA46A57340D4170FCF63598FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
0xD0788B08AA562CA5F5E62F61441EB891
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
0x4EAB1CB2B92880B16AD39DADDD34A416
child are thriving."
0x9BE65C680EAB176ABBB536118CBE3742

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
0x2E4179546BDC39E5E51104572AD9923F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
0x47A3C95AED4A110A2A3EB76D0F16DEF8
badly at present--in great trouble."
0x67C10EFB0423021B8205B47C5123FB44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
0x03D983B64BA2D5D2270EAFBF59ED33C7
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
0xF5EDA1A29BEE98F2CBC15E1C8D1B9803

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
0xB4650FD743D4599D8795DAB022AC732A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. John?"
0xD7F7CF08398DED6030EEFDECE1D0D3A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And how does his mother bear it?"
0x8A6DB18E0FCD1C5C2F24620C93079D44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
0x8DCE13096FE9CDBE18891E9C0C8BCAD0
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
0x961F97FAF3A085EB2BD92A5E8A6BADAC
his death was shocking."
0x9C7E0C46F3B4F3B35ADE407C4917B396

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
0x99B20F9FFF6D4689071774B9B1752831

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
0xE934E4461E73428F17F7B714B8034D8E
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
0x4FC194882EE6D1929FF012146B653D00
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
0x735EC473027087FECBA2E817255B3BCD
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
0x965CD25A1B501D254E8D6EC4FE3157D0
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
0xEF21E33EB4AD09CC9A2113CFE1AB11D5
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
0x04AB93455A3BC8DF8DCD82C9B85CDAD0
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
0x046E8B42E83581F4C7960BE033971D4F
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
0x18A42808709AE696CEDF5D53EFBC39EC
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
0x940E200159C620E0FB3A0CAFFC92060C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
0xB8B6488EDCCDB69F4D8019C77FC0CCC4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
0x61128F17CA78CA2D3D6E0ECD44CE8EDF
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
0x89A13EAD52E5041CABAFC50D272D1F3B
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
0x5BEC9E85DA78208A40A56B480F1F2898
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
0xB374B25B8932315C82F60BF0632ED38B
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
0x1E0ADC52F745DC2A25A0BFDA1E770568
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
0x86F410B68AC76F4D39ACB171A2130530
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
0x813C528EEB8D5A34006B48FA28745773
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
0xA599834876C2E526CAB63F805FD064BB
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
0xFAD6D4A133C60B1FABBB73D50220D524
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
0x4D45EEF82CCE5A70D9A2D95680EBA8FE
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
0xDE1DF9C8461D3C609B5219171D90CED8
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
0xF470AA8CB5491E6F825CA87554422676
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
0xAC2C8A83B080B41C8BC77BE5B734AE82
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
0xE36F306E5407AB862A53E3C5F9826348
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
0xB75703C7F9409912D09A25AA313100BB
morning."
0x8DC321528DEE4C341A592C0889549BD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
0xF5787D630EE75ECCABB0194E85B15551

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
0xDE86580226721F83A8F32BB6DFA5381C
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
0x6BD0B41194BE136A04CBF05FD689103A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
0x2AC1391324553F121AA4E6F7E917055D
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
0x79B59040DCE63E2913E789493DA598A9
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
0x8081661E40964D0ACA9DD46AE0F4235F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
0x30651BE00F6F745111527F620D0E2FCD
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
0xE186B39202780DAF40E205E1A225A010
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
0x8B3C34F5FA581DC12A980DCF15637D19
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
0x208CF67553548E07489A25B283AEB4F6
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
0x639F526BC2A5F7A3D80A69E017F1F947
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
0x6826B983C3ACD58E5B59B98501F4C6F1
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
0x6FE3433209409C6E68B2308FCACEE4B8
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
0x3B896A6D58B47F62AF2D35615BD299CE
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
0xB9C36F283A07593E86EDD92FAB58F8E5
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
0x69C0E59BE2F187916E91DB121009EB8B
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
0xF42ACA09A881BE9B691FBBFCC2F36B81
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
0x0B92BB994B7EA68D2B9E7CA363EB7598
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
0xB528BDF93146F2203BD8254407187919
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
0x33C69C5EFAF3A7A3002283CAA70E3BA2
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
0xC37F83849C8E8D9469E0D167C3E863C9
lineaments.
0xAD4EABA86F39721B45DD0E291372C2CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
0xF885C6D9035073309A03D96C480822E1
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
0xAF71FD9EBA5B7C0CC972D3C2759096B0
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
0xF6935DF6D75D76D02099640B0B5DFF08
cue and followed me from the room.
0x236325B9BA4965582D76C84C0F80DB63

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
0xFE8293535D6F72EBED41F51EE278319D
which he had shut.

if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"

I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of

the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
0x324F73B299E5D637856F15C44331EEB8
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
0x1BF9BA761793B08F56F1483C597DB692
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
0xB7A3FEB018C1E4D313FAA037FC3C2E46
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
0xBD1D6170F5292E141DFDC2107683A05C
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.

"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too

late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The

Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and

went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
0x3F01770BDC64A8AEAD408B7B86D59E52
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
0x9FB75D20917F9AC590A8509CD7E77C08
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
0xC33BAE925A21D9E13ED8C4FB250DF3B4
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
0x0D96704C5A5E3AFFD1A775338D3B65C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
0x76F0798E00E7010A44521FB1015AF2E2
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
0x0B93F5F1562594C2D48E7F7A9CFD327A
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
0xE29D86927EBD518533F4B4A94FBA9FEF
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
0x714F17CD99B7949D26FD6D62186FD421
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
0xA00006B5C34D3B525FB58C378FEA2BD6
looks.
0x5DF38F2C5DF38F2C03D49E8C1DEF6097

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
0xF6A324B7C0C59E6BE99394C4B0210915
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
0xAFA96D8942DAD72DDA7678034468AABE
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
0xB6FFBA6B73A42BF20FA7FCD73BED2B65
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
0x9F92497EC3A9B9466FB83639626E02AA
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
0x3F8F2A8BCF5D076B7DAC28D9A784C680
obeyed her as in bygone days.
0x31D5B98E1C98B231C065D8E31FFF3C72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
0xE063E478CAB3E8AB163B3041B945DAC6
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
0x89363D4A11DD2961DAF53803A33C7B1E
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
0x285CD786B75743FA510B01A3D8A62855
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
0x1F7163096B70C012AB0B68CD2C6A084D
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
0x1A89081077FFE3E8247DADBCF21FD4AB
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
0x8A656CCD6536BE3DB2FD91F2F8358F89
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
0x32C17A808501C2DD825B4FD58FC6265B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
0x8A0E7B60C106B6CC960169C23CDAF81F
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
0x2B60886E823B2FD057851D5A9A39CED8
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
0x3E0D16C3439CDFD2103334017956D112
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
0xD828870F0BE5F873019A32CD2911CB20
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
0x3BD350F5A5E7F9F099785543AB53B5AB
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
0x9EF6E399E91985430C618FA405E8D0EF
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
0xB551E746139A4299BA508A28F0931C68
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
0x40607496EFEA0FC0C3F5D391F69614F7
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
0x1C96E3189A74D72C6C75720536224544
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
0x4D7E5D3FB393A8FAEF0C9AB9D618DB0E
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
0xFDF1A8D975D6088BA4A0ADA92B2E7A46
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
0xAF57A4164026F77BB63213B1082D27E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
0xB88C007EF72D1153E185EBC46C6CD83E
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
0xDCDC340CFC8C1C51FC2C6DFBB857CE73

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
0xA8258289B9583D845A4873D64447A313
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
0xB97ACD896419699B9753BD02F31047EC
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
0xE9D5C877D75BC2731BC9C80BBB2B99B5
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
0xFF3FFBF942F7F7760F22B81AB61C9E3F
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
0x99A3FB82DEB4FFF1BBFC09C49E766467
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
0x93D1F5751EFF64A9E5150D9D632910F5
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
0x64A4CE3C111285BAB4EEC747211F4577
past recognition.
0x65519E42BFCC50C66B757E7F978D529D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
0xF9F0725F6C38DB83AFDDDAAE387FC358
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
0x2BA59D4FB3E73B766343FC5D348248AA
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
0xCA6451C2830C2ACEB048B6EB56359A07
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
0x11927B146827DDED094D85A09FFD67FD
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
0x4123D6E0C46B293B1D56E3DF84E422E7
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
0x1669E31EBE470D8F7E664AE18E2B5C42
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
0x91F9FEE1342694FABF7BA07A22DD757A
colourless visage.
0x22D71AE776056D5D072E96F802E8B7D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
0xAF0CCEE5389A288E957E58F1B6482470
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
0x22CE2FA074496E5A1FE6DE4FEB77F8D2
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
0xEF3DA207AA07201E9C84C31EB94E5590
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
0x38022EEFB1F328AD52E46915DBCB5C94
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
0x89CD09DD82F32BF3B9DF5D6AB5B262AE
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
0x441FA3541A48FF244EB843045E212956
other's looked puritanical.
0x99563F5E3AFF85EEF92FFB58DE7F12BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
0xAC57B7155C817CA5B6A0DE220AC35C51
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
0x2C77B96F2F27F620419604F303E0643C
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
0xF849D52CA8B8058430B2BBF5079554A5
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
0x89B020AC36A01FB27B56390D3D30FB9B
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
0x817915075FE85E7903B13845C2A34931

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
0x3DB9A0A1A6FC82A582BDA981705FCB0A
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
0xF5E66BE5D5C51B8AEF1DC8FC5366668D
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
0x319A3E889EFF80F6D41A40AFBC317326
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
0x60B6951447D5559C25CB2E1DD50A2B1A
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
0x63063D013266706419708BC596CF4C4B
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
0x24A2774EB4F0DB8AA41A6BF63B4B6E3F
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
0x56D2E1227E51659FF20C99BE3B03507F
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
0xA3A745F1140C822047E014228E7BAF57
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
0xEFD6A72A27E591D6A55F007C8D92A4BA
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
0x8584A1C25986F4CBCC86D6FC6062B96C
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
0x550E9DB5E1C9B54C074FE44D48EF845E
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
0xD94E89968A24EFF23B4B64D2510F97B2
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
0x87624EC10897D668C76C9B006ADB867F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
0x8F713CF68BE36A2729DA96B8C4DB6F9A
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
0x664B4746B2B15FA978524FC5BA9FB0F4
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
0xC60CA8A93D06D0AF6A8FA389E5BE253F
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
0x249ED9BBA87AE54B10D33F3FD548EB9D
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
0x603F9186D23F0E306EF83B947899D02F
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
0x22785BEE966A62450F72E297C3E97154
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
0x9B07D8137AB7410D313242870FEA0BC3
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
0x9C74E4EBA1842C399EF51462EC58558D
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
0x520419132B263BDC321319D529B0FDBD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
0xB9D6B2CFC1B2CE4A0E69040B969093F7
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
0x1442A15D821C9E18B7C1458FC6E6FA11
liberty.
0x6CA81630AA2ECB4AEFFFA96A4F276205

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
0x1C6F613839625FBC8BC1300045D36BD0
can see her to-night."
0x5A039C43053A5CC6FA2A3E33F3915725

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
0x68B4BC642110AB49C584494FBF9E7DF8
should be much obliged to you."
0xC709363F0D782481D4641E85DD5B5DB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
0x4CF14D61F52CF6C7B05C5C27170C3222
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
0x718569716C1904BED1FAE075AFDEEFFB
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
0xB207FD92FB4512B5D8F9EBBC022701EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
0xB262C2382F191B503EE5A19F3DC0F4F4
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
0xCE0A67D5BCADAEDB57CBF1CE5676CABF
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
0x0F40F94A6E339C8CCFD8FED934F60933
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
0xBF4FA574DA3B8D88C95E357EE51DDAE8
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
0x2E67BC5EBB26229B3A8EE31530AE9B97
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
0xA548255857DE11810D607C961020EC77
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
0x28DE0CC16E927807F424FB04D461CF97
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
0x19B72B1AD14C6BAF372C3EC3FE3C8CDB
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
0xF1B67583E1063333513C44218F0610E7
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
0xCFC69B49D73CB21CABDB8B605E28F3EF
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
0xDF5C5E4EBA2BF9A8B0AE88BE3591617D
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
0xA046B295B20560912DE5D9F779F23ED8
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
0x509223AEDD3FDD2486A68E1FAAEFF48B
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
0x981925656E37FD8A3227259AF8743FB8
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
0x66702EF753A1D54DC383379B9573F76E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
0xA1E93FC732B0806C41558A6015609762
us see if she will know you."
0x71A174A53F2D11BFDAB87A27A25B82C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
0xD00645952F32AF153EB8BD51B4F3B140
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
0xB41ED59BCAFA10861C29D931C4E59317
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
0xCC03EED41F6B96CB18EAF2C9E1DE2AFC
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
0x3A23015BF82144DEFEF374FF986E261F
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
0x311BF6DE34C4DCBDB616A84BC8AA019F
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
0x3C3192906AC10DAFC73FCFEEDF149432
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
0x8E35CB650AD8104248C657DD6E3CE04A
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
0x97838CDB96A5512B6B714595A9C058B7
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
0x029975D96068AB3C914A6728F3CACCDC
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
0xB70796ED214EAE81AA8153CF77384B8F
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
0x58A7C0AB55D08BFE55789930B17CC360

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
0x013C2241A600BD9341F9822C279423CF
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
0xF96E89ECE6DC389830F315AC025921A5
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
0xA39420904C97893D97470D9277C2798D
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
0x818093C58841932D57EED6E4AAB5936F
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
0xA60D1EEEF50EA7F32BCF77A0C5129798
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
0xC71F2BA1E19A3D5D34697E2DFD5BD8FE
amity.
0xA53FDDEBA53FDDEB1CC9868FB7E664C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
0xA7C8B12D3656151234CCA2EFA06F6992
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
0xA3ECD4B523939FF44247DCE7F0744916
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
0x3AD245937358DAC0300459202C1A1EA7
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
0x22FC87A0877223639FF9109747B869B2
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
0x48EA7C8B3F896C234E34FE3E4213BEBE
she looked at me.
0xC4FB20FBCBA1A3AB6B2C04674AA21899

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
0xE86EB0DD95063929A766CA840CB2822E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
0x647599BBE01A4B6EEDB41091DB6EBD03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
0x73D9DC2262F5B3D63DD2FF2B38BFB88B
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
0xD9512947353C24122E1501249A01D5FF
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
0xC2A2E0E33FFBDACB59C4E1EBFAC47568
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
0xD255B5CEC27E8A38554A4A2443B17569
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
0x4BF7617778DE87D30C2D80949238656D
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
0x687CBEDD6C8467562DE4F55CE1B6C9DB
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
0x3B33A74A1BC92E07C34CC7E36D08B983
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
0x0BFAE6AE1C4C93617E642E11F2D568DD
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
0xA48DD4E978921F298A95EEFBBA60E9ED
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
0xC23C6F9AF434B0705ED277E5C16912C8
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
0xDDC63C8A00F9D31907A78961831C61D7
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
0x59C83ACC202BFD35C8734D075E67607F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
0xA9008A85B46F22ED220B4671679C5086
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
0xE6E0FD05E023B9C623F474D31034D185
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
0x856C76CFD161C228C20FB2F3EBAE7E4F
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
0x3E3FBE7B1C3955518AFD88D4EE824B59
the pillow.
0x777E6B22C04FEBDAD5B4FFAC49476C5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
0xC5F1116EC2E1D185AA522B7602FF83BE
till I see how you get on."
0x598FFD41F611C9812B08FCBF03D761B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
0xE2CE6D8A1CE2301E124F71D1E42761DF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
0xA034DD9AAE631D7F1AD68EC885045FFC
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
0x11129D65A2433D5C3E5C723CFF0D67AF
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
0x1CA99CAFC63CF6C36207FC0FC312E8FB
say--let me see--"
0xF741A0412350534A4B4649FB48B68CA1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
0x91DDE02EE7616E6F86A8E760AB86F32B
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
0x66658F72EFEC28743A086594306A6600
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
0x579929F46B065C500B4FE6F2FA93ABBF
was at once irritated.
0xE12CA892EE23A1E646386D5BEEF5244F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
0x9EEC814E5412EA18B1A57C2237590D45
you Jane Eyre?"
0xB980255A9E1BF9F3B12A279D4D3CF886

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am Jane Eyre."
0x767173957B60FC4062F1ED2F9906934D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
0xF528F70276BD69F0B040F8021DA64145
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
0xD1CF2331ED9B45875AC714F1C24BCC49
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
0xB6BA9A6F826D816CC4A428B932E7649B
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
0x2FD9DE9A1BC6E2DE5F0DECA0EFA7DB48
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
0xB1C5B10345B271F36591FB8A6001DB58
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
0x2B46F1B24BC1B5B109D99308EAEEAFE3
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
0xE865D31256FB440425431D6B59C1298C
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
0x85F739E42F2D08C1273F7E3E1B88DCAC
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
0x0B71327B7D920AA5BE0DA3FC9D2C7C6D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
0x6DDB47BB2E5643A4F7F70502C0965DF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
0x73E4CED441B7FF2779696C220F71EBA9
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
0x8E04D533BBB83958B2EAC17A397B6A8E
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
0x7CA98554F042B2382CA3DFA9A502AEFA
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
0xECBFE1DD0926BD52852B9ED0FFC7F5A4
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
0x6C4C861ABD88BCEE9ABC274381F214CD
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
0x4B2C98E5017AB014466A85A0C876EE06
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
0xD6C79689810F5E15618096AC27AF99C3
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
0x64C181C7FF555EE25DF9C795A65EE699
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
0x2522D2654805B7218EB8E12D3D7ADCB5
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
0xBE3C1355C0D1FA93FCA36D55CF0A332C
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
0xAD618B8CFF5C4FB1DF95E8BF672D78B9
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
0x82C98549198CBCE4960A69E063038CB0
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
0xC7A09BEE6D160CDEB9D4D82C59DF873B
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
0x1C8D1E7F0265140A6E7E09D85121E629
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
0x84A8DFFF7BB4CC2FD0BB3426E1F54D0F
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
0xD781F945AB4F664EBE4B8C92E31C9BFF
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
0xAFCEE00ADDD76EEA4168A3FDF53894C7
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
0x955B88E4FC70BCDF0103016FC9358BE6
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
0xABA5CAE2DD9A09E94FA701DCD365A3AD
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
0x611AF5A2CAE529A5FD4F536A4C1C5DD4
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
0x55C94840A21E61832BC4CA3ADAA72F67
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
0x4E6C00C84A9ADB7C57AC773F91610B3C
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
0x495E44CBF31BBDE2350DE2E81917A6FB
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
0xBAE1854669C82BE7FE0FE171881069D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
0x0060182A74D45688CDE25CDBCD62A767
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
0x37B60C8EC04B223445813A216633108A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
0x3A94BE74954A7F024D0462C9CBEEA843
the morning she is calmer."
0xE110E89BE768877D449F7C69363C025E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
0xC1B51F713F046A99BA3A6DEAE68DAFE7
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
0x7EC05C1AEDEE63F2D6702A6314181F2C
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
0xB72987733B9FA8C4FEC7A2E443718EB3
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
0xED3AF6F3FB2411EC6F991E6E626BC487
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
0xA3BC70B78EFACBFAA7238CDCE8130529
had?"
0x780441D5780441D507E9F6B61F95606B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
0x9E4F50080E80C297C5265A29680CB875
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
0xCFC81915E9C3C51A8609BF532E80D3EA
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
0xDD6CA816D0654EC49C06B620E1DFB0AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
0xA07772F7001D4BC216AAA942D91E24C3
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
0xD0020D2512728EAEB1DE4B3BC4139A0F
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
0x99A49B4007038366C916EA9685D7C002
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
0x0C32ECF5CDF7D6DAAEA3F343D69C01F2
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
0xD99D1809ADCD93DC687B2BC4C3684585
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
0xE76C170F1A4B2CC5BBE28B847BB4EE1B
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
0xDE52E71988A6255C1458C936E90B2A60
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
0x71420F464E13E195EDC1FF6A253790AE
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
0xE3A3CC4E33FF44C188B4E9A028232065
for both.
0x1CD56C2DEF532F79AE96FFE47310B82A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
0x17A6EF04E8CC78A4FE213A803B68D1BB
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
0xB9C32993346B8FC6DCFD6459CCB45D55
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
0xC21887D2BD3E09806085C5B769FA4D9B
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
0x77EF36577C0887CAD4C12491FE948FF6
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
0x602C4C936B8861638B32A177F2F371E7
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
0x85BB62903A7EFBCF333232E4622ABDEC
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
0x4633B2622BA461A5C357323DCB235D21
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
0xB750D9097361EF3F4917D4CCB2E420B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
0xE3F188441703243EBFA3B7160679735E
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
0xA96DE64CAF10F367475B8DA567BAC142
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
0x2D64E09078A67BF6DF5B4C353DF85A05
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
0x6FF613532D810A64B4D67C721634799A
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
0xD2F32713065E4BA5D14A063F74742B06
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
0xB081FFD4BB1F427B49972F25A321258B
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
0x2E76775E1F40F60583B32029F3BC8A7D
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
0xA696531F8ADF4078D2BAB5FE46D633DC
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
0x5B8D905FB422D17F4D4B180AC2A24C37
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
0x0162B7BA87187DDE51BA7B5A0FC751A4
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
0x51834A39C6610DB96FAA4B49461A037B
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
0x48AC873D0E0A68F331ED239E8FC6AD48
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
0xF68A2DDD3FD642B7671F4A297AE2AAD3
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
0x4BD77435F3F72656D42FEE68FD3B9596
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
0x521AA63593353C2604321C7AA8710982
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
0xD50B574708DC2E75EE7ADCCE43EED1EF
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
0xDC89ECDB30530D257C3B7E6001370519
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
0xF51C8C2167D89BF047A013600EAEFD4E
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
0x2B7BBE24FB6811FA56436933D64731A4
and content.
0xF65D9BF5E83CCC6C3560620C4DF2DB8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
0xDFD4B0A5F09A12E08D1C5662ACAFC653
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
0xB859512A183C4CE5E8FC9F30CF7B1101
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
0xCFDD7AE8AF1858C29958D29C740655B9
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
0x7B07BE609E2ADFC0353F3DBED612F7D1
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
0x62A1D464AC3B370DBBEB173C74541DF9
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
0x1379C55AFB50EC87403D3870DFFBAAA4
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
0xBA61683ACF486C3EEC15101C4C96ECF2
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
0xAC69C6F91CB6851A5465EA09C8CA3F66
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
0x6F39E97C47542C9F653238F9D184C93E
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
0xB25586CEDC8F28F6FF69238B7571FED9
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
0xE78BFBDAB1FF1EAC2B6298253837D279
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
0x46ADBCBE335421C83D2DE32F3A80EA5A
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
0xCC0787051AEFD2A7DEA638D08176EF0F
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
0x9AB9F8BA752E1061A722C7DEF79FE00E
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
0x80B5F1CFDFCE6BD0D22ECCBB06D32415
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
0xAD6FDD5EB0646ED6265AC76140034620
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
0x47C6547E54A3AB406417F9542DDAEF70
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
0xA8E90162DC02D0924F4AF63557D962F2
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
0x55ADD59BEA5A099311297409123BE5D5
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
0xA6973585D128324A3E3A77B9395EB376
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
0x6F548DEC4A5D277709DE73969CF088B5
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
0x254BFC9C81B86D948851BED19F4E8A0E
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
0xC962DA14301470FF2A1FEC0913FDEE43
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
0x89FB15CB4D8CB18C2FD2D49888CEBFFF
mother's sick-room, and no more.
0x4363A7EB7A58C356DC9A24591D82ADBA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
0x4A96AB5FC0EE0EB3446C916AAF6784F0
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
0xE79A6107D85600094E7EDF78765641BC
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
0xBCACBFE6210560B64E867693606C9B68
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
0x9D2BA86E1CBDF85F4A56A349FBF2221D
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
0xB6EB0AFF0A0092AE2F3F2024F4B6DB50
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
0x771FC1CD63F477DA8556CBC4B4FF811A
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
0x7D88B5F2C9A301C032002BD7E36649CA
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
0xCBA1DD937CCFE3A52D6811746CD3C70B
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
0xF2D9AFD92C61782F8CEE8A8A4757BB9C
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
0x713FB7F4F6273F022553C18159EA9173
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
0xC9964352F6F3019953CE4B5AD8E1A57A
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
0x56C5E260767E146DEC956D21F67BF73D
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
0x00AA724421967EFBCD0B4CB7019661DE
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
0xEE894B4FCC4D0180AB316D8E449C81A6
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
0x241CA1DA95972D98A7465BA5B2FCA496
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
0x7FF5DC6347902D9DC601C77AB3FABBB9
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
0xFBC35954ECB578B7170AA911A3B4C5AA
vary its clockwork regularity.
0x4BF123F0E54DA6E7E9014963956597D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
0xE4EF4FA17C7266BD4929A71A6F4C5047
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
0x30B7BC0AEFD616DEBE8013A7C8706543
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
0x744CE24603D3F46422EF34A44F4858FE
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
0xF2E7BE405C14A34D6A674A2F9DBD98F8
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
0xCF3BF9413A62C590C69F03C43D0FE88A
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
0x9D99AB529CFF0FE46511DD4434B057D3
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
0xCD1DAF8FDE30D147609F5748F1E587FF
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
0x662D6AFB182B8D5A9E6A2FFFD1A59DEA
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
0x608746D6C7A3D898068AF2DE83078624
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
0xEED78EFCD1CFC5DC5855E86BE4FE64F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
0x911CB2BE17201FF112F648C343A778D2
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
0xEA47789AB19FC574E1F738CFE03701AA
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
0xE918E38AB081EF6648BE617B43EE63E5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
0x88344E756B41166BDE095D59A0E2E2C2
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
0xFA9411FC035BA6B34F5109E489D61027
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
0xB1F616B7CE934B9A24113402CE1C952B
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
0x891BC0F127E3BA94D30E7AC5204295D3
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
0x59843BD91080DA53FF8D3998B4E50137
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
0xAAB4CE24F8C5453D60DE08555855340D
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
0x28CBF9B5356099FEA637B054BD6D81D7
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
0xA437F88E9E875D4F3AF10B3D9BAEC1FD
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
0xF7C5423BC3D5FA285246F81834AB118E
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
0x8D4A09A16253AA12C22E8C06A76669B5
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
0x4439C21E19001E780FE0E8A671ADB70C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
0xE616ADD050873CAF340E427A6AB7C1AA
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
0x5E9B1892B567144DBD2FEA3C3A943362
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
0x237F4539D801919F41AB7E2B16A8B57E
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
0xEF6925A34BD82CD9406E4121E5D41AC5
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
0x599E2DA40EF357C6845E806CD1277098
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
0x6A424018E979A9A0B25B85058E55E87D
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
0xE0CC7ADADAAC4576BD154897D7A8238F
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
0xE22E39285F7E153BE4168A838C3DD53C
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
0x477926EF55A3A45084C9FB0C673E02A4
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
0x2C7247E777A731ED8E64CCC0059AEEB7
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
0xD2DBEB742BF8A6163C1BA22B2DEA897E
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
0x0368B671132CB04B000506A97F5430E8
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
0xB3C935658AB32232CC74332CA90CD0B3
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
0x9951A857F26B604FFF8975A18B5A6657
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
0x82ED44DC85735428A38CFAC0174FE26D
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
0x54466CA1CD9B52884DF008C5409C034D
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
0xB59EA96AD0908E7251387EBBAECA554B
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
0x503E9D3DCFB1BB8BAF7F535CCD6A25C0
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
0x9FDEA9A676640BDD04ADFE3013DFEAD9
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
0x6A1D131478AC65F8969FB4BF34F2E4DB
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
0xD4B270ED0C98CBCA1F1ACCB7CC7E0FF9
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
0x375C9C988B8C497A4B8FE59076C4D1CB
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
0x1344D34D59FE6CD6A4009B69EB4B62C2
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
0x0676CED6CCA82EAB5C6857D4AE47B846
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
0x2D54453F8EB43F83250720A1626E4054
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
0x23433A10B126122630572D31A24C4670
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
0x6BC217F124E824C42F26C179500D5D95
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
0x8A1BF6F39F3FC32BE0BB2A9F8B17718A
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
0x4CED343B07BF505D2B560B5FEF9700DA
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
0xEADE6163B5C32CE29F258BACEFF7F1B0
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
0x88AFC493276A71D4D6B5AA0BAC411B40
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
0x9290134A2D1C27851E72108309346A76

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She closed her lips.
0x75463C9C3D80B7000F29DB022F0A446A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
0x72017A41D34617E6D97E58BEA7A8A90B
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
0x10147074CD1586A2EF2F5CA14BE7EC72
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
0x27C8CA6548B28132D27397913B4129B3
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
0x0C2BE1BC946A318E830D7896423145F9
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
0x288DF6AA738D7FCEBFB77B7D0D5FA7A4
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
0xD560451428438D2A1AEA73CB30F6DE7E
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
0xF572DE32916BDDC574F013528264D087
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
0xCDCBFD58142087AA19E39F5B7F58C325
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
0x2ED778BCB017F9C6E4392F271585DCBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
0x3EEB427ED632EBE0A5ECBF3AAA1D3ECE
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
0x2696211A5A542E8BAB97AC25EBD31173
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
0x1A4489F349AFF349BCB92F3F00F66517
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
0x6F2E8E1D8BF6E6A915B1505FAF57059D
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
0x831871374842F637A21C254C7AF056A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
0x06C92D5B08E301EA619C54DE62FB3DED
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
0x215A92C25CBBAF692CEFE639ECE95559
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
0xE59BB7BA796888E3C5AA32D74682C2F2
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
0x490E7D17830DFE1A44D12B86FC13C887
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
0x52205F9E8A68314EC8D166BE2833E054
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
0x26A17EFACCA6551067C5B48904CA5281

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
0xB7BED63B8A41FD06BA9361B522E1BBE2
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
0xC80F02449DE902B8965F9BDFD98EFAF6
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
0xE69317A230935106FCA72EDB868892A9
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
0x16869A22CF6A18811E0BE25BE3A7550E
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
0x68E9DC91B776EB1898A079954424382E
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
0x229E2477B009C6F34E8D3399E9D25A55
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
0x257940B8037A1D55594AD69CBCADFC28
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
0xEAB2DD81D5B91A9161AAE69A13532F01
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
0xA58FA9AE800052E5D57ED2433C259DAB
me, and then I moved away to the window.
0xBA17EE708E4D47C5845051B8FDE70D2B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
0x5D4C664B3A6B1360F4305188425CF4CF
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
0x7730CED65B6DF04E91F21EF920E2283E
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
0xFFC737688614BC9E8195AB9D75060499
tenement--flit when at length released?"
0x566E3AB55D6B9CCDA524170CED53B4FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
0xFA2530F51DB66E78F59055879F385E40
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
0x3F3F9A81DEBAF87E94C3006D07818BB6
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
0x180F032537B0C09618C9F8352B9CE81E
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
0x97EFF2B44595DB0841B2CC0DA6AEF258
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
0x91746B1647B856ADF21BD89CF3846ABC
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
0x63BA0996C03BFA8DC06351336D0F6D52
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
0xD1680962065D9E7DADF75760DDFFAE91

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
0x20D3935514D58D756C7C1FEDD1756560
her.
0xBD4478FEBD4478FE07D1CB5D14D90A3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
0xC459009301767A51D3AC85875607386F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
0xA8EA4A3B80DBDA042C77575F2D51D1B3
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
0x2B90F91FCAD338F898F67B6970E6E348
me--where is Bessie?"
0xF1406F28A0D9BAD6A6076D3C309199E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
0x9194D4A4F62A75ABDEB08F1A0897ED7B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
0xE80F1DEB7A84126BE9C95B06FB7DDEB5
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
0x62803EEA030CFEBE6F905D73F974A6EF
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
0xB42BEFE4654590B87178AD64626D3EB5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
0x8D8A2021083096582C11263BE8B07456
identity.
0x57B6FD7D093FAFB411FD86343EBE47EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
0xE1EB58261BAFF333FE9504BCEF620668
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
0x959B8CE8DDAF498FAAB7C7976BADF321
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
0x3E6B796B8436EA21A3DDBE1DEA8D71E0
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
0x6B991C44953779BDDE7D2CBA38E21688
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
0x5207708EA9DAFE422B594D0F4CBE482C
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
0x193FEF7818BA7CDD712A4FA8D8FADAB4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
0x794A6E3D0613E4F2B1BBAEEABD037AF3
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
0xBAC0578EE575CA577A4B4B40B0EBE1E9
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
0x7B9860F529C05A09CB4F6B4D90D57E1D
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
0xB1FF217C40102A865DCF349437F4B3FF
or is there no one in the room but you?"
0xE05DAD1AA505B30C599F9DBAA1F77C02

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I assured her we were alone.
0x4E1CEE405FD245A512B14958905CC00F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
0xE7D88C5214DEAA9990E0889155AFDB24
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
0xBD87CE4F2175CECF7A91B6234A745720
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
0x22A4A5076130BFF20060CECEC1B8B5A9
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
0x51C50CD766FF66D942DE50832A9B32A7
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
0x462A593850B14DAD6B0EC24347F03570

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
0x6169506883925465396A36EB01B2F13A
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
0xBCC9DAD06857C50406CDF8D9F163D85B
of the last pang.
0x1F370BCCEBE107A85A42F38A60BAC40F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
0x23F9B766462EDF2FEA49B44D811882BD
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
0x6B6C213108E76961759926287778AC91
there."
0x566664785666647833884C8A219E657B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
0xD46B5D44D2D6EB76E893BBB60C9155BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was short, and thus conceived:--
0xD71754318EBCD81BF393083FA886188F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
0x3667A2381EB06A4AA5174549627165B1
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
0x5C558246D5490CE0775BCF6B22A97330
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
0x8F4A2693505DD5DCCBF30939C892AA31
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
0x0E486B764B1ABFD370B51ED015902F42
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
0x5C99EA3815179A2D416FE0CFD761270B
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
0x9A13DB68831AAC5719EB0A6C55DEF488

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
0x2F3F65A101A1E7FECCB52FFF3B2CDD32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was dated three years back.
0x88AD53C58625F35BB48E5B90B186DC8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
0x6FA46033E73339750C0D95F73999D95B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
0x77E3C5B428D955587A792D0E3610FB69
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
0x5C7471A8F2F931310C5A07E3802FC1BB
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
0x67A1FE4EE8C5C7998675B5E6F01E3B56
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
0xE772FD2277609AA8BE0040A80A0A4D79
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
0x69068562B76B5BA1E53F8554303B47E6
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
0x04B9BB74B154D2ABFA2D21B10FF016EE
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
0x926EFEC91180918BB307A2BCA4C472AA
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
0x77BAD07AA695788384008701005477C0
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
0x590DC0820DE087D71ABCAE27E35BCFE8
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
0x20A2A98A9EA8C8D1D1C4003109943544

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
0xF814E6D683CC242C5A96CF0AA9C1C154
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
0x982957B1806BE697B88FCB6CA4C16D51
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
0x47728CDD8CA09B04E53CA2996368951B
passed since that day."
0xAC3FC91ED67746DA91A6B78138584006

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
0x9E117696B79A8326DDF13705118F5B4A
drawn breath, she went on thus--
0xD2B4E3EF56404B73D89A246C22728835

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
0x39407CA53DDEE10461D5B6773883EEE9
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
0xB0195A8A01888B5A145B9E2B12995FFD
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
0xF598D13D0A57117B42A62575AE844CEC
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
0x234F9A714D2869F45B145BF324D26498
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
0xD3EAEB544158F1277FC2F5DB531B3F96
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
0xD655C8870E6941B7BCE98A873ADADE0A
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
0x320C5BD55C030C5467C3694BE3060665
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
0x0B66F81E3A1FF34560B41C8B33679A2A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
0xCEF491AEA8DB623F1BCC8C72AC8DD31C
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
0x48BCD0EDC783251BC2619F70DC59A52A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
0xBB99DD403F046708F33D22D277405D42
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
0xA97D2727B8FBD6EDCCE4100A8C15A1E6
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
0x058CF329E99793D336CDEBA92ADD6BD1
violence, I can never comprehend."
0x9309433DDB149657D26EC9D53A626086

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
0x8C280CEE2F2FC4A1955DB8F957CFB8D8
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
0xDC88EE2C7D3FC3EBB84702E0AA624E36
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
0x1D0EE7AF19531F8F774C70946A936958
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
0x5ED4FC8C8C598AFDB41AB079621A272C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
0x54D5B0443D24D0640E69C103F5391208
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
0x5B04DACA91DF0F43DD61B8C685AFAF7B
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
0x3AA4B6625889758B0572B37682C7C2E7
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
0xFFC9FDF33BFC3A979E0D0FC34CCA4AB3
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
0xFA79A77F62DF7B075C3BEDD47C63CE43

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
0x44DB154FF7A5B595BAA98B7C360A5D63
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
0x13A21A5B405C74D04CED7150B949133A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
0xD0A6A6647C0CDAB8E3BE175F1E92A974
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
0xA2016AC42D5FF6C0867263DBB9165C02
she must hate me still.
0x00507E151371DCEFED4BB75EA3F6E5A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
0xBF0D5316BA486BD4C7C3CBC6A4503D74
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
0xC8A7AE5ED4E3825AC38BD85B1D25F5A7
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
0xD42E9AFE5FEEA56B427BC4276FA9AA35
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
0x628BF03A17BAFF0A04187680C8AA71DD
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
0xCC471EE42EDA000794EEB37C6C55CDB9
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
0x2DA73148CEF2FE24B7B9CC75C6714642
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
0xEFB29E077B2E8AF4E0ACA110A12812B3
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
0xCCE70B502621EA521991480A27F07EDC
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
0x046FEE952714656C47790440EF933BF1
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
0xD01BD6E179CDBF20E4F0FDCCF56DCCB0
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
0xB80335C46D48DD21002456D6CEBC0E4E
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
0x57E00736E283EE8DF19CFBBB867E76A1
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
0x44BC9F0C2B3B4C6EF386146D04DFEF0F
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
0x63191D9C8969D5ACCE56CF0CD0E36BAC
form.
0x1811499318114993579EB7C1A55A54CC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
0x791662A820086BD8FC59EF4F061D5974
observed--
0x33940AD66BC42EF2C9C9692CC73B4107

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
0xB39C889CE39CB27E90CA8E434123B740
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
0x9193101D3D0460B83318E451E2F19AE0
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
0x8BB49A442F5D471201DD60757114792E
Neither of us had dropt a tear.

CHAPTER XXII
0xC32D17A129D39AF5679AC500EAD0D609

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
0xBD30A5BDAB069CE2003B8FCDA829A691
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
0xAF5B64006E0A6B3857AF014FF072F819
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
0x06B1BEA5019B88099570E78D293A37BE
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
0x830EB28EC597374B15B04660D4F304D1
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
0x4E6A38A225012AB96ECB052306110837
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
0x0F70B330A1E7768E841897D9E197B2BF
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
0x1BF761236103411EC9BD1E001A53EC38
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
0xB0CB18F9D2AF75E08E5C21582799D176
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
0xACF03E9876647678FB24C01641184DD4
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
0x5D8EDA1B2C8256D3FA8F7A409FC4F144
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
0x7273A9D40A1123005B02F3852CDDCFD2
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
0x46A009900FDD00188D2A908204E92948
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
0xD84AA9DE6D44ABEEE183F4A3650AEB92
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
0x5AA36B9276FDCB8C3F51C5C6A9435E77
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
0x5874CFAB8D4B1709853D4E174E731F6C
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
0xDA8A71DCD5ACE4F9504D5CC852526631
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
0x5F0A63EB40B2C841AED5E8F114434AE6
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
0x1A52EC094B4DBB716999A252F7BDAE5E
patient and compliant on my part."
0x57887D2F9E80EA9FAAFD7F69BB40CE32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
0x8736074BC439EA882344296C8AEDA35F
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
0xC2FE7E7583DFE54C61895F1822CC6B4C
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
0x061EC6BF3ED792DCCDDEAAA62E7F625A
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
0x1452AEB217796899358856F139F03D54
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
0xCB17968A4D6575EA74397858BFEFA854
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
0x51E94609E0588BFB1932FD56287D0352
notes of condolence.
0x72AD11C4B30019A0B195797D543C7A31

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
0xB22082628E546C32638F94895B98EED6
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
0x5B2905A32CF568A33A24807B4908E377
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
0xC9ECCEFF99DF1FF7CEB82E693ABD3632
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
0x8AEEF022D581AABAC408DB7655F3ACBD
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
0x1C76A8263094366EFBF949697208E12E
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
0x648F1A45C99DEA5ACE5F255F0534E4D8
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
0x7683CBEF4BE55D020BBB8A02E55E985F
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
0x75C311C73D4E29FF1656E3D8C9B866BB
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
0xFF63022A43E2336858ABFE2E8C4D4394
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
0xF1254E088477E62A312212F67C763B3E
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
0x52A7D6B90B8D6FE78F1393E81E88C48E
veil."
0x3D2EF0A83D2EF0A82EBAD006C8BC4B95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
0x73F6F68BFFCE364EA60C3F360BEDBA40
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
0xF60CB802377F4B5652B615041B0F1239
good may it do you!"
0x80597DCBDFBFDFD16BBF0FCCC2FE193B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
0x1A881844E7359A8E9BBD1FFE84B96A42
you have some sense."
0x146EE443FDE8B3C047711F395E6C70CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
0x0DAF67DF24278CE70A754DABD77B74B6
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
0x0AB9E3D5DD0F58FB38562EEB006126D6
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
0xFCBD0CA1A408CCD6ABF9818E46147E38
much care."
0xDEBECEAAC2A477C43441E398273EEA72

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
0xC3CA6D366831BEBB294A9B56AD949A08
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
0x98AA3C382EAF32985A86A6564795B2E3
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
0xE10450EE6242767FDB1B7B82BFF9575C
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
0x819099E096DBA2FD33264B5C39674828
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
0x971CE8502DFF470D5A84AB56C7FB439E
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
0x5CBE16AAB63B66ED4A791E574BDB1738
fortune.
0x82C27DF072A00075895CCC11DACF2BFF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
0x411414F03E5712749A6DD8AAAF44451A
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
0x9D900CD72FD1BD308D2AAFCA1E2C7AFD
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
0xCCA56573FD2E5E95058FA28F93D2A5EC
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
0x36F88B66F696DE8231AEDBB30D0C3414
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
0xBDAC9F7DED5D57A040A5B2C58861716B
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
0xA7398094AD0E663C2FDB3B3D466574DD
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
0x907F8663E34D3E71BD8790F6F809E9D3
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
0x68E5CFB0D5A739DF3D1DC0AEB4BC5583
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
0x448E5B114326FE7047B99F9048BF763C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
0x18FD279197F97DC5B5EBFC1BA737FE87
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
0x7DD12C8957E812E62F52C435512359D9
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
0xBFC2E7F97DFAB3ABC52A92C62A9EF21D
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
0xC10E6D422B3A93C068C596F7590DC626
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
0x797CA1D6513AE6B2B519587956699DEF
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
0xCA252EE25C10E255D3002CAB63746982
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
0xFA62969BF04CF46796E0ADB0F9AC4270
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
0x951C16DED9DD282E34DE0D1652FB8E13
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
0x38C787339A5D6AC5280DA1C06C83566E
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
0x4F7781E74F56D60D6585ABD4005006F5
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
0xC8A66A2FAB65152F7DD54211451B4A70
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
0xDDB5D752AE022C006D9D26A5AB1B5B15

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
0xF701398C1FD02FC539735B8B96DF44F9
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
0x71B2B7F71E5D4A0F1070DF84F3B676B5
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
0xF4265CC27878413279FCC67A72D4E0BF
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
0x8358C4A2952B39EA7668B061760D1916
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
0x7A3639392437D58E049A2BC9B9D7E354
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
0xF9B39E2527486D5F38794DD94374F433
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
0xC1215B8957D03EEE68702C97CE7D5217
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
0xCB06D2EEC27E2AEC752189FB170D78F2
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
0x444EAE68DD7187D39556C692119CAC42
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
0x4C7F09F836A19091ECB3A5913AADE699
don't doubt it."
0x074F24A26F661E36EA3089BBC6F218AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
0x576D992DEDE8F7464CD1EB3ACE03AE3A
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
0x31D044A3C433963D3D2C11F5FE669C1E
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
0x2430B0B45B9099E0A29E5040D595D705
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
0xB5492CD2C05192EA2D26BFA7879BD3CB
both her and me.
0xCCA62316134B6C6F0DE0B51681057CF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
0x0AEED2752E06B942289A16B2DF6B95A8
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
0xFFF4C47444FD1F20BDD797310AAF8E4D
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
0xC5C8526ED2F22049744C566C99B5DDDC
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
0xE5459CAE76DCA593AF2A0DB07A28D367
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
0x2AFE4ADFE94E5478E75C0AF385B76C88
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
0x1D3318D461667AC9764C710BC7897859

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
0x07818D3BC77A7FE5AB75C761FE64656E
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
0x3BC50429D424E845CB0BF15238D6AFD3
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
0xCD17B22234BDADD5DF92CD94F8435C26
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
0x677FDF11D0AFF09CF13D5BC16E68574E
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
0x813FF8432D17DEEC36A2D919264FE819
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
0x735C3D02FC3F03421B2411554AD5EAD1
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
0xA293D8496DBD75C719CBDB9CBB501C11

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
0xC9A5832F5CEEC80D9DC03E8239B75FCF
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
0x7D0DF503A3B424CFBA2A08F4FD644C09
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
0xC97F469F783033CDB367918EACB826B5
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
0x0515F57B66DC8BCD09D548A66C629C57
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
0xCB1A46E95E30815CA690DD12DD25D912
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
0x9E35E809DAC8880F3FF83745989907B8
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
0xA2EEEC6CEB835D206D5DE46F3175932A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
0x4E81639E3DD8732B43EAE06DA4C210DE
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
0x2BB114E81E43995F672BB7BC597DEF54
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
0xED46B8B39C6814750A1C9BBB2EDD4C93
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
0x3C9166A97BE9FE6E13E2D3DE9F62DC1E
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
0xEEB85CBD16A773E0617A83FC1014CC85
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
0x76D2F2B3F46FB196CA7CC0FFB368A25A
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
0x191AEB5D783C841800167375D89F46E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
0xA0D07E611C28F0E441184A24E4A546A4
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
0x802732400F3DD16429402C90CD63ACE5
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
0x7560CAD7F623A8715C6C15278D28F47E
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
0x91C51C4BB3354C481B9BB4EF26A3E7C6
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
0xFDD92B4576C24AEF00FABFD95B877C6B
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
0xB43F58714EE564F0348EF62E750DF988
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
0x9FAA5E34BB9348A41BB2FE2ED7F9980F
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
0x82D6466AA176FBDA4E8E75B288605C07

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
0x5E31E083FF22D504C2F91EE8EF5ECED5
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
0x15FA174CCE7CC7444B54411D70BA13CF
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
0x8D629042E4D8927B47E500C0641AB13C
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
0xF1A4709E2D8350F74DABDE344DBFFE79
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
0xE4661F109BEA1E9ACFD2A3901E58D326
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
0x5849212854E82BB671B3C28DF785E8A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
0x34A6C854C32ACD97E3FE290767DE9A6E
are!  Come on, if you please."
0x486FF29EE577A509FC53D581717B15A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
0xDF204BF70C160FF14BBCE39E136C5789
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
0x4D6FE9066E55C17F222475E0028F43D3
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
0xDFB3DACF377D04122515126CE381B578
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
0x095A9E58CB6B024571F1381BD8AD767B
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
0x14BCA9515A47F53F37885C85DC282033
behave with decent composure.
0x92DCCFF734B0FCE847DE3FD0F819F21D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
0x63E98CD97FDD1871B5307E25C687C675
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
0x1182AFC14A64BF011CE60163EC1FED0C
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
0x4219A8DD3419EDF84F770ACDFC96DD92
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
0xF4DDBB66DDE30F9524013934F2725D22
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
0x30AFB3CA24542EB91C6CD86E93777560
month?"
0xFF10D8CCFF10D8CC435F9488DABF0A3D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
0x39D4C34EA08D284543E781B1F754A5C1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
0x5F19DC1AD1BC6A58280254B06A2DC53E
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
0x77E349132EC6EFF65154E3C89AC9925C
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
0x0F99439709F20504702E49FE4E16A175
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
0xC1980361E8D1F4D142308DC0E91F1953
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
0xA5C4EF3AE4E3D3C6E20FD7223362AF40
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
0xF0666C1DC91038B4C3DD42582F229B14
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
0x17D917E312610BD49C008655C602E459

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
0x46BBEAFBC27A095A291880EA9F01F849
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
0x82A66FFF23A56EDA28AF8988AB0EB51A
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
0xB94EF23986737F23B2373A77E3BE658B
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
0xB564F614F37C1D6AD2F8874A0A7565B4
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
0xDF1E3ECEFFFCE5A8557C71FC04817CDD
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
0xDD8BC36AAF95973CE3E9F851D2EC8ED3
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
0xD37DD8CA4F8221243F987C37511A353C
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
0x8E3FA81BAF2E432F5656A52EB1BCDA5B
that it were my home!
0xBAFAE53C744C2BEE020B32A132F7FF2E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
0x43479BDD6544213F3A2E3E4B88DDD0F2
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
0x242B5746A5A6463B404BEE6482B7E777

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
0x506156E324B157661FF706788CB61B77

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
0x028D49175546D9B283AC062E358507BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
0x4C93190FBE441B96B209A9CB653FF95F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
0x1C7592DCFC03A5A3282AB789B341F866

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
0x81B5963BAD3175031CA296F12E5707E6
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
0x6267AC99CC08A742E15BB466C7DF21FB
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
0xEE266C479D0C79DB7C50F198F8D420BE
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
0x07923A147C43CAA4BB979B6C23875F6F
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
0x225EADADA22FDEDC2F9BE2E5916C1727
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
0x2A65645ED69321AE06475E617BF51337

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
0xFA54917190FFA99CA50A8037C177E03B
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
0x42A0632DB7C1D7FD36E7530B9E67C7F7
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
0x11CEF42379C9A9C2BCD8AFF322BFF79F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
0x5E25E066FCE6B0565920724C9795D730
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
0x544C5597DD2E96944D0BC93BA847C101
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
0xF791C19F7DEB919B15DF04DF4B9FB5DF
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
0xD2D4E2DF50CFF7D4D9D9D3A2D4AF1FE2
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
0xC128AA5ABDB2F7A3D60F5467D979209F
shed it over me now.
0xF31F4F9A4FAEFC57123D96ABC198805E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
0x16423CC0D5AFF40B64C4B9327B422F9F
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
0x9A00EC7AB43323AFF1F5C00EEB593B68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
0x20187212925C10C125D74FCBE2380B8B
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
0x8C8565FBAF0134EDC897198A066B3A7C
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
0x257382D8DF3B7E4B8C250F6B6542F4F9
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
0xA67982F555A8006DD7AA1E828183147C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
0x71A0F6921D5EE188BE0A85356A2D0272
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
0xBBEBFFCC0F3BCFA95B2FD853F6C07F10

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
0x3F4221AA0D91087FA7C45811BE9E38EF
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
0xB37D5F484115445E534868D93B55A394
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
0xF4D444BBA9FB35160208871A8C43E4E2
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
0xAE36F58C239407B2FB3AD4BC354C916A
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
0xBD8A058A5F560530CDE9E6972634C07C
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
0xBD2932756DAB93B67EF36FCEE3ABCE90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
0xC0C5AA1A89AEBED2AD552BD43CD2B123
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
0x4206FC6F5DDF12A871B0CB176CEA50C2
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
0x4F2F330324BBAE016C1F53BB0A75E4BE
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
0xB62EBF8D396603833DF0D3ADEC5165F0
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
0x0BD74E9C385F36A6F47638CF8BEBCEC2
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
0x49D61D190BAB103DA5175A8E67C8469F
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
0x86A96F0A1A3612001FB347CBB10C77CF
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
0x143AB8B439EC86D61410105D74347CA9
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
0x136022F98B0AFBB0191CC9D28B3BBE8B
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
0x851B7FB5A9BB35BB2350FB4478299B52
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa

petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
0x2654A4CF566FDD6AD9517CB813D9F81F
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
0x8398F12C68E8B113A8F05AE1F2F0AA89
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
0x225D0F4972FB7D163AE3A48829476C35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
0xCF2CF9F758D3875FF6D3B0758A0C8460
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
0xD784B0A65EA63B788A0BBB9BB0F8420C
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
0xD0A9D286E2A0AB4C802EEF97FF22B3C5
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
0xE0E7EC24DDA64778146337D6D1EE9BF4
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
0xA6062AAA74AC9A4F23F09483442D7DF3
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
0xFBC7382E93E074481E2E18D90D03AAD0
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
0xE7CCB904FBE6A083793FF5523911B54D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
0xEA03DD6758BF9354600F3035B6371FD3
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
0x84FC84B44479DFC9D67F074B2383DF1B
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
0xF4EDBD83D745C4F35967C80281129C78
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
0x2EEE9637D16F6191BC05A4E43599A64E
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
0x5C36A50B992D14145D4490CC17B3332B
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
0x9AD61314143A1E167141CB5BEBBC51AE
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
0x3B47E7046F41DD97C4684B3094F35080
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
0x435CD86CDE73F3A13EECFAC72704460C
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
0x413AAB0E3B1A8763E174BF0122F1BA11
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
0x6864C051402D93D9FD54D5134160066D
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
0xB378BA18EA12B35ACA17C8CD31031993
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
0xA48722B8BEC674130AE7692119324447
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
0x9EE90DA891FF4BEDCBBB5F5BE2591E19
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
0x33677AA7EB8AFEA5990DAB84D5356621
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
0x8F81154FE44BDF22BF3A50E99CA1886F
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
0x57BCEE61D86A133B18E8883D5E6FE2B0
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
0xF57A5932CF3A751DD10290B13A2A9B82
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
0xF6DA3DF2E49676573C7A95B1C22DE518
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
0x418BE21810E7A867BFF2FDF38E698B2B
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
0x9C87CD4F235431732B6BA3F0428FC30E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
0x2A8187FEABFC79044F1735AF7CD606F3
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
0xE0E551DC5A2E2C7DAF1BFA3811063868
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
0xC0634D2098D9FF7F12131A649826D113

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
0x613EED72A133056F2CC499B8690B3CE2
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
0xE1773A8F210EC43BF2CECA3289216CD9
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
0x6B50AC68B86F1991C910BDFB2BBFB17F
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
0x135D8143761B76B9A8877030E3C0D466
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
0xA39C7EF1E0EC1D36106D86A93FD52310
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
0xFB553CD30D125CE818A7646D2DCCF506
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
0x539E76EF4022B0735E0F6ABD8C7A2D60
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
0x96288C454132F055F488DD35005E2379

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
0xE2F29111A49AE9C23F5811113D5337E5
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
0x990F3F0463B50EC99C81F95374754B7E
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
0xB10A96A58178C1970E817D8F92A4EBAE
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
0x5BFABE3BC314F31750CBF6D35C13476D
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
0x3069B2D57A7133A6E98FDEFE6B22050F
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
0x5E95BBE896EAED0DA11747FFF382659E
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
0xF5FBF4712BE271FAFBEF390806BC3EDF
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
0xB9690F8BBC2309FB945CBA37EAFB1BD5
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
0xE1BE03E79FF2BC7A432C15C5EE57D6A2
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
0x6E91BCF614AB84D3761F956C0F6673DB
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
0x6071B68FF7145714CCA64BEC7B1E93A4
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
0x332D274AFDFCEAA65EC48DD9158DC37A
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
0x77B5902C7F65E915A8C263A096190116
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
0x0DF1E90C26F82F9FAEBAF7F1CB1DB3EA
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
0xB8F3AE41F731CDF0DBF15060CB56EDBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
0x77F1C53172903811ACA560633C53D2CF
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
0x4E0FD61A164680723EF28D673F2D96B3
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
0x78FB3D588DA5DEBE64B7523143BA8D26
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
0x77A6840BFF86C7160143854AF7B750A4
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
0xEC96B794EDEA72E758C69E1CCCF493A2
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
0xE55DA700E7C05734E6AA6C711D99D5FD
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
0x152638AAC6BBE6AA52AEA4493F6E83BE
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
0xCFCB63725CFEBAB564A839B03076778E
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
0x51D6BE869391B44F123222FB68D59777

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
0x206606D3CBBC81437D14DE9936E0112F
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
0x1D0D52ADEC54028C7F3FC576AFAA6B3F
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
0x10734DE55A2A1884491CD83700990C37
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
0x33A821DC0DCF833BC6E1BBC42DB971D5
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
0x8ED1D7BAED7B2CE508381A941EEC3C49
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
0x0356FADE401E64CB3C223F5EE4C2A7D2
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
0x75CE35E545FA7974C3B138267ABFF64E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
0x2DEA74B0DC58DF902C49046D7471A5FB
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
0xA3F0D63249031B36D7473EBAF2987531

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
0x706175FC7A0CF26C8B671245BD09D6AE
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
0xE2A320C8C43DD5BA37768C91C7D006E0
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
0x714F23ED6C5D2E92CECB8BF583E82C21
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
0xA4131AC590A43AC49050A82C6323C584
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
0x09F21510D1E45C0C27AD2F1B086EFCE0
turning--
0x3D994557A65F3C082CB4E31546373E78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
0x429CA8F349569586AEE7F9BDCCED4E35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
0xB328BB4B2EB3B398CCB11645A9175A7C
started at first, and then I approached him.
0x3706E780466DD9EE406D9C4463409FD4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
0x1409A0EB8109DD7D97E37180DEF3F249
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
0xD9479F40FA0F23EBBC83E6FD7AB6FB9E
there! he is flown."
0x32C03A0E5D8046D76BB49124F56D8E76

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
0xF33190D737F54ED0BA5512C0C7826B8D
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
0x1BA3C516137974B812FE6BB251597E1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
0x87A86FF0C836A4EC66B3935A15688596
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
0xD887EA94487E8331582E3C6B9847FF4A
moonrise."
0x71DF75A8DEE20BDC3CCEB9F05BAC65BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
0xFB99765EF1592DA7E7073E0F7DFD3C47
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
0xCF69D8B9C7FE16B3DD66C22173D3822A
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
0x3BD0BC839729582312A7ADBB1120EEE4
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
0x8205AA35B2547DDBCD60E1C7A830D150
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
0xDAAB8DD8DA8AF8BED189F79D94061BEB
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
0x0C02ED1EE9B27EBD633564E8E74D8CD2
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
0x3165308524F7164D8969FE0BF244B742
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
0x435D50B49744EC1936F6FC8857C7DDE8
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
0x6A2E7B06A5829E980E486CC1043E8104
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
0x89F414643C5D50D35B3F359635C0421A
mind was unconscious and quiet.
0x4B36078E0156D9A14E45254A6125A10B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
0x145BEC8FEEB71FE1E98CA42B5B940E40
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
0xF0FEDC267FF03A18FB77B4E8CDDFF53D
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
0xCB0BA13A5E905F3619DCA1A014409AFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
0xF58ED4FB26E80B61F24F8CF1C099FC20
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
0xF6746ED4DBAD1BCEF6A7959309224DED
Adhesiveness?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a

degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
0x38FE4926095AE403C6C2BE13CFF5AB6D

0x30359500A7D6FE2DB298A57CD5B4B0A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
0xDE8CC0BF1073C92A7ACCC215580DE518
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
0xBC517DF2B35142B0EA54BD543659E5B2
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
0x8627F823D2888FB50B6D1F83929061B8
on, for the hour of repose is expired."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you

must."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

straight on the head."

0xEB5EF42A3DF7DF5BBA8B023829A083C0
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
0xE5DD8AEFEB8DF4558042B190AF1C80A7
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
0xBD41422E3EE5023BF1347EF77B41E6CC
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
0xF8BAAE3B9341FACAE24FF83DFD098AEF
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
0x88E3150E7615AEB414562A145414A70F
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
0x5D16E144E8061B90876B8538067EAB31
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
0xF1AA6E67FFF483250C49AA0BF5DCD4BD
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
0x2A7B6BDC6FF4982C5C5B967877464F09
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
0x7DA6900BA1D12E20529F3E684FF93B83
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
0xF3E31319DFB73D9044A581EB62407410
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
0xA6D44F45737B35CCBB7899E7B3462294
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
0xCDC553F1B821C38A7AF68D9E595839C4
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
0x489347CD3CE55D33945BEF73E84810BC
Eyre, must get a new situation."
0x98FFCB35A7119968A1EC2F0C4F62B001

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
0xB75A2AD2E9BBB0F2E824984AE4333940
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
0xFC5FDCADD8AEEF1DD1FF0EC4132F5F81
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
0x294327699510B8995156AB8749077414
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
0xEB5125AADA67C1BE73EB9670C39E2E48

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
0x0B5C45FDD1B1443AE87146A1899B397E
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
0x6CBF67409C8D3BDFF51E4CE25E9B4E99
for you."
0xCD72A814ED4A4B2021C607164A68952E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
0x46D702620384A7C58F423F34DE08EC8A
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
0x12F51E9C0E0DBD83387703AF372B0A48
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
0x74A372AB2C8974B037C3D03B8FB9D012
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
0x06FA293D14C1935A08281FE5B1297E71
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
0xCC13F07C76B7123408899E0364780779
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
0x601BDA608B8B1E787D08E7B1828CDA01
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
0x1EF496BB52014DA44F31B2133F92CDA6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x0E148A30CC61D14EC1058263552AE27B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the

distance."
0x35D691B73115402CEF560F8B171AE7F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
0x6B33D398C5BB76BE72910A9BA2042CBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"From what, Jane?"
0x38D9D7C304DA81778935DAB5F0E3EC9B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"From _you_, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
0x5CF7118B12E86EDF6721D9E3FA6DD6A8
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
0xED5FEB60A2756D5E07DFE2848CF94158
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
0x43A811BC56CC264DD06560072BA76DD0
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
0x2C67487C474B52B1E6C7B4066EEE71B7
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
0x29F425E81C26652AE04FAA44716F466F
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
0xB3FF0A0BD64800F56C04DB2B1782EA7D
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
0xE2384850C5EF9E08278A5E49A1597107
loved.
0x518298A5518298A5B273E50B962A4FA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a long way," I again said.
0xF585DE6D82FC4C00FE40A56A8C136911

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
0x607E6DD5A658C9BC90666356CA0B969E
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
0x28FF0B1EDC960B9ECA794C0B14E2090B
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
0xB4B61A44F07ACF08B0CCEE94CE897A2A
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
0x9D7D922FA64C2FD3759698E2C0F39718

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the

little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
0xB40AD8BBB16802D5288FB175AF344CBD
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
0x0001663A294AA26772C5C2A0EBC67019
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
0x06BE90E650600C8AAEEB845D7FB035B7
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
0xDE99E1AC15600FC653BA4483A98456E7
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
0xD95E6CA6293F42D5BF079C7B2FFAF1B4
there together."  He seated me and himself.
0xC7CE105CC880F6F783842AF82B39090B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
0xD60397B6878B99773E91E0CBA9AC31A0
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
0x1CED43BADE28ABAD72184D0431B68659
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
0x62B3ECC9A53BA8390F444EF6A3E41CF0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
0x5A3D8E57174BC2FED37CA8EAAD61281D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
0x49314417A19A1790CFE5572A40456D23
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
0x2A93F0A1E8D9C3AED53DFB19E1DFDC38
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
0xD3C7B87A6BA589EC66114F6E0D784449
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
0x66EFA2812BA93FDB3DA4136566243C37
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
0x5F3F1C243A8AFBF9ADBCB8B384B241E4
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
0x24EB0441E5364DFA7A8C625EEC7AEE16
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
0xBDECF7072C10BB78384FB5514E69A89D
As for you,--you'd forget me."
0x466AA2997EFA2D121A65171260663809

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
0xBF09810AF4A16F43A3A2E85DC61F3224

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
0x431B964738E914AEFCB0D93873EBD1CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
0xF6C2583908D57D25B9A3AB43F8AEFA9C
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
0x607C4B76E80A5FA8CC4DFF8AE8D506BA
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
0xB7A82324437864D34256221B176BFA7C
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
0x3A4D830F290F19171066C47CB352B39A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
0x9C401C611E186B152A4CAC4BB1543FB4
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
0xB9459002EF3A50A22DD071E563794F4F
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
0x6FFD8EBBF2833EE210B631213961C2F7
speak.
0x77E56E8877E56E8820C71AE745CC58F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
0xF0EC5B5B35F9ED0D21E9E3433B95F142
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
0x2349C15371AE71AFEABBBD756A706698
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
0x423B383AEC671B994C6094B219F26D59
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
0x2F5EF9B48FBCB6E9199468DF7F5A0E47
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
0xC549D992DEC0DCC27B3FEE519D5991D2
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
0x662CD7D2287C68B4BC51EB748C889940
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
0x1AA8285729698CE43657D0DBE7A28447
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
0xFB22C1A5D1D41ECD39C1FF8F1FDC577E
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
0x2F1ACE0BAB72091C1287D92DFC5970FE
on the necessity of death."
0x86AF14286957720FB692D64FBDEC0CFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
0x8B38ACE713014069E78527DFA782F731

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
0xF3A44D1ABDEDE2A285261B5FED0319A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
0x1D9A24AFA440A7D061E3B2E0BF455494
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
0xE548FC5C1C44F16282433DEC9411A971
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
0xF69DE3CBC8CAFDF8780D0F6DD5971350
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
0x6E0D124C2C5BE3AE34B3A5137FEB020C
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
0x23B01B0FC1BB474D182325C18768D6DC
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
0x0A1DAA21554D9592BC4F2558F6C1AA0C
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
0x6200CDD1FD249EECADE4F3D12DDC4A48
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
0x1A3319C170C2E0A939D522A76F306F96
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
0xFCACCA43DB3A58AC914870B97BC00392
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
0xD86600112D18C660DBF6E625D0476D55
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
0x01EC8E8AE411BA1CFCA363E327EA2D11
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
0x146CE170188578A21ECF095CA4D367A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
0x04E30BC728DC9C7271FFBE0D3F6192B0
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
0x727D96A9D4BF8C1A7C6BAA82E33A9CD4
Jane!"
0xB0E8EA2AB0E8EA2AF429B09E7C54CA54

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
0x8D0DC02C3C335E31D50B08B7A803D47C
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
0xAF222AFB5E01EF0AABA99D32F8844C49
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
0xF31BD1B8D0FA1E708486917DC8053DD5
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
0xADBAAAB251DFE4320721CB0EF5ABE478
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
0xF47D6BB9CE80477E16FDE07383F5C7E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
0x968CC38AF4362591460281F21D687E37

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is

rending its own plumage in its desperation."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
0xE155573B47889C6E7D24D2C700A2D89A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,

my heart, and a share of all my possessions."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
0xBC610D2B5A8A98D4B338F864978CD121

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
0xF2D3512793D0EB618DD54906DCB210B7
too."
0xCF1A4118CF1A411856AD9EC784B56DD9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
0xFF5E26B97C13B512C6EB1D1A92FC8A12
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
0xF17E807A8BAB5ECD37D738822597DD30
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
0x98207DD8312914E328D998AA8D126A84
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
0x78DA4408DD12BB938C1EDFB30B29A74E
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
0xE6FA86D4ABE6284B7FDC9083F37DE117
said--
0x86CA0DB586CA0DB5502F29F4A081027F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
0xD67EDFC6E2C5880397B0D783AF27E4F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
0x822AF8F1AE481895C3E84DD4F88DB555
return."
0x947F16984AD704DFA9ED115E5BD9FF5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
0x10B9C03B4845219488A05A3917699950

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
0x1EF6272EC534BE0F5B433626FA1E95BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come, Jane--come hither."
0xE85B891413EA5BBC86A512D4B81564B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your bride stands between us."
0x5E735B6350460536EC502A33E7B213D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
0x582CC97A227E9A5400005D3EACF4416F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
0xFBC23F7139D31ACBA818FC6208AE8CA3
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
0x431C47E0FD40A1366183C5A3572ED993

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
0x5EC5D009BE6EEB7E0413905882875988
was still incredulous.
0xBCCE4C86CC8F85B3121CA5D9EB79609F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
0x55548A5F49D775CDC3CA5DF17210AE1E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Entirely."
0x29774121EC54114BFB94F4C6379C3BAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have no faith in me?"
0xB6C76E35644538AA31BA4C9F6FD41C8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not a whit."
0x1CB34CD41267200EF5607C95315E8352

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
0xFDFF1CC6B7F304C9C631F6F69E5D4C65
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
0xCDDC9BF23797D6E778F8DE57BEBA8D30
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
0xEA930C77A1C166BEFE0C483840ABD6CD
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
0xC141002F81987F5E91597EE3DFA4933C
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
0xC6B0CE701A67725D78959F7F75693A9E
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
0x70F1B81964C6BF3A4ADA1F0B2DA92AFA
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
0xB8C81981C55A92E803EB178999538619
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
0x27FAC5C01CE6CA87D6CFC6CD852C6A29
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
0x8FBA8657D0A45C4B6B4279EDA1B7BC25

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
0x4B50157C1EB4FDF3251A4C1D4FCCA764
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
0xBA68D4E79429524831636791B9C15558
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
0x6CE4D0B58F300ECA02CA6FA682048BB3
given me?"
0xA56209456340E8A1313410E628C2AB50

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
0x476CD171E73B203E5B326EF786E221C3
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
0x5EA3014AD6DD0D4E2B78DF8BC3A6ECFA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
0x8D700BB00C75D39980D9D5606D0CF7E5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why?"
0x945337BB945337BBAA9B489B8A1EF709

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
0xBECADC5407244030796B2612323FEB39

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
0x91EB9970F767163408DC7AFD84C733C9
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
0x849F3B89AE9E51A27784568D34297844

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
0x7EA3011D592582FB89A4BEE004A85104
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
0x6E97711E06E7C9C81A0BE4D2132270E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
0x273080E0AA3A25F1C239243D74033627
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
0xA5688700FC153D7386188EA3C9B81D27

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
0x6382B99DF31C51EF03F56FFE7DB479C1
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
0x02CF514F2A88C2458F1E9599CBB1610A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
0x651C171C986D5A7E9E877417BBBCDC97
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
0x4A9BEF6A0BDC1D30A6EA0B43790F93DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
0x678BC4A06B909C4A826ABF309F624D46
be your wife?"
0x1E6FAC7AFA6A6B8FB1DE9B52BCAE1753

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
0xA6A138E91B031EF42F41FACE124910A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
0x60D9C53D4951E1E6077319A972971998

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
0x5BDDBDE316AE9817C324DCE3923C1C43
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
0x073EC0EA26D208F64DD895D7FFF6BEDC
happiness--I will make yours."
0x67EC3861E37DBA194CFD0575FA09B676

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
0x9727A78544EC144EE74B9275DDCBFE28
have her, and will hold her."
0x5A8F3D8002213540FA89D11FDBF0DB90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
0x722172399D1569A0E0F88FC5771CB01E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
0xEE82BCC1AFC22A4B09C992106ACF94AA
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
0x1039971F677A792D811C159B8E999290
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
0x407E114B5F4465F823B8938BA634D89D
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
0x8FFCD65754E4CCC4F06D4CA8BE87A9CF
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
0x81B083354AEFA70BC9696781A7EC416D
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
0x3A4B0A13C76D1B97A949429D036AC87B
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
0xD06A5EE01224649D7BC905BD1BB80370
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
0x2DE92BF85DD9BDB59206C78A77CF591D
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
0xBC779519AD1787CC10A02AC134B96B2D
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
0xE20C7E9A37F667EE68930FE00E918F95
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
0xC37D48104BE8F429C844CA1E11630EF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
0x2D0D736FF30B8F9C35EE549BCF5DF5B9
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
0xB47FA43E753F39DACB892741A7D3D9C1
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
0xC45B1338EF2891BF995C85B27FDCF2F0
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
0x391DA782A803F7520417E7262DBE88D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
0xD18A08AD614BC0650191B713035C2312
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
0x0C0EAEA8972293B51E0F7D26B6086961

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
0x9D43125BCD4279B314B88474077346F7
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
0xE15E4067E70D31AADD24D050E190DD22
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
0xC0331F1BA952B43BAE9F9F82B0177A9C
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
0x5614496D03805622FC34CBF14B196791

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
0xB1787F1D265E6AC28E6166355AE6E82C
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
0x2CF76BADB5542DA2ADFAEA45A6E541CC
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
0x95E410B56FCE23BA3CB3DCE23B0697BB
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
0x3E4538EA3434D06E6DDD03B65AA5DBDB
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
0x1EAB4295D719BE2524BB6B2EDDABF2EB
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
0xAE74F7628A931EC05592F88D9C884271

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
0xABAB82891065AA63FA934F5ADE0188BF
night--good-night, my darling!"
0xC483142F24D0756F6286753E6309E67A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
0x8FB55C556BE56478DC1EC07EF07F52EA
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
0x1423E7A191EC6994EE7F90BA4D44E319
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
0x89570550039885AB3DA6A2D1AC92A2A0
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
0x09E236819D8D4FE12BD0F8CBE10EE901
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
0xBACA3D342EFFA11CF4AC3F7B5AFE653A
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
0x33A1249743C5C32D5769FD1925DFEC2F
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
0x26E5BDAC479AEBAFC91D8C3E510ACD9F
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
0x25B786ADB09B564D480FED19EC1C3FC1
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
0x1D45AD3DED3C8E5AA6B9C4AF552C190B
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
0xB28C97BCEAC18EB0EE3491E738A347A6
strength for anything.
0x5599DF544E7B780177DC44A5E8AEFDD7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
0x37CA4E6926C09414B415807640E44F38
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
0x6CFF99954FEF97A45DFA85982E561C81
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.

CHAPTER XXIV
0xA3BDFDDBDD9C90D9E5B6156B27C68437

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
0x042EF6EC0CD7672CEF1B0E1928EC78B7
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
0xFDD99400B448661178E15BC243B7A126
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
0x947087AB52BBAE3D24684A16DA1ACDC1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
0x835AC1B5D70769BF1B4D7C4FC5EF0982
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
0x23409774598551DC0321E595F6F4B965
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
0x7F598E869BE11CD390F1CE822A239EAC
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
0xEFC6936B298B775C43D49990D430B1EF
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
0x38EE0B6E34867B9F9B9EE09451AA4226
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
0x9F8D01BE5BD5FFE4C3C6D5CF76F7BB43
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
0xD0B1D990F4EE28D1389A54AC34000194
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
0x9EA5A3B3D75A1CF80439E42E06373293
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
0xAA0A919FC0D069294850A03E898FA586

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
0x0B931C385837AB8A79C3C905734F4023
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
0xC8027A1A4D4D93CA4C79AE836F11015F
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
0x721D2020C5A6B339AC4B9906DBE5A4A4
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
0xA87BB9D2C8430D85436D2E8EF220E514
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
0xF4C1491B1852669AE669C3F762128270
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
0xBB23705EC5E608D3B0508583A53311A7
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
0x63640695C86A6E2A05924B66AE966FD3
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
0xB1D579E2C8B627C742CE9B7E85A7CEE7
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
0xD3358F1BB94F92582D7CC0C16AC30CBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
0x9F78D42D074988FD786AC59178B7A2E6
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
0xA97D97D65A7570D939A981754AAAC45D
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
0xBF5A56DBA14FDFEDBFFFF900712EF604
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
0xC31F1E01DA3DF2D0E2219B5F2324AB6A
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
0x663476551EAC618BBF9072080181D62E
schoolroom.
0x349DF72E98F8B87A90815230F842C9AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
0x1A720E5DE21943A667A3144A19A4A441

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
0x0F0C721A77756EFA03555365B9B6F138

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where is he?"
0x7B584365ABBBEF875FEA77D83F498261

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
0x9F9F035B54E6BE02123684BC50E9E9AC
there he stood.
0x1F481213EA2EBFB98A5DAE502EC2F5E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
0x68EC10968B812EFF2F9CFDEA3EA2AF75
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
0x9EED678587AE876A1C59F48F15F43A70
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
0x6E9CD7DAFB3151A3FA55E94A6F31C761
well loved, so caressed by him.
0x5910FB90E838298720328662F15C60C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
0x1502CBF812E020DDF89D26D2E6868245
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
0x00E40B857B30A91D84C4E5CD2FAE0C24
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
0xE048F1C2AC65E87A8228DC3988EAFB04
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
0xD274400118501050044E08B798EBF489
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
0x701C5130F8A5B82E34CEAA06DBEE25E1
new-dyed, I suppose.)
0x80D0C6C1557FD28DD42E0D18BD32A5DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
0x75868857B249431D87BA5417B1825633

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
0x2E0E53B33D686AF7DD9EE3034EC79622
more.  Do you hear that?"
0xCB830B8D27BF97000DFB34D547C4D9BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
0x28294AFC549B5B1D392EA57DBEF20016
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
0x7CFF084AF7EBE6BD10CE868A3214AA61
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
0x32560BEF656E573C421DA3451BA6FCBD
think almost fear.
0x090DE8DCC788CD697B57D4C3A59B821A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
0x556B2B6B3C58249B9D10D43A038589EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
0xBF35598BC545D86E05CA6BB740A841F7
strange."
0xB4BE21469067C27FA88E1CF623626974

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
0x0489BC41EFD76AEE4F0FE13A4B8563BA
Rochester's girl-bride."
0x917B25B4FA20A4AFCDDDC91A610AB925

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
0x04456D4A5C4001E9AEF1A686CAFDB73C
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
0xDC9E79EA27438FF3537CB5800C0F8919
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
0xE099C9BD7CE1AD5ED7E8A8A5210A6E87
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
0x1AB7B92D0327AEBC7415893D5D6F6427

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
0xBB0AF5E6CD4798CD8D651DE34500ED8B
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
0x7EFF6A55BAF4519044FDDEC3F1208C51
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
0x99F855539ACD6A252D08FF2198D039F0
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
0xBB0455E6D67443C17DD0A1A64042A4D9
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
0x1E059F0375ED5068A5D6A3BC2ACC243B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
0x6FA808BDE50B890D403A684541BE0B8B
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
0x984158534BF7A47A05CC2D4824B88B62
have them."
0x912A1571A59904687F7AB4819123DFC2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
0xCF0569AED987613233376BC3B03DE58B
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
0x364E28DCB045BFDBC1165C3AF0FE4689
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
0x31571BB9FA85E1B69BDE1A5391766C9D
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
0x239BDD901E47354195B24639BDC32ACD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
0x4B85E02D084866B5A16CBF5A7F975022
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
0x659C4EF980225FD9EEAAD63700E95963
Quakerish governess."
0x93EFBCB6D240B16AC2E40711E6ECB709

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
0x292F026C54A21469EFF4C71B68B9920B
heart,--delicate and aerial."
0x641955D8DC2D3395ACA7DB93EE3D796B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
0x03C8008004935755990744FA991C3665
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
0x05B8D8FD38D8705117AEFCC74981471A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
0xCAD86C1D2161DF07E7215CE736263231
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
0x4044D76B5BA936281B8AB6AE41004AEE
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
0xF701E8902A9E6DA62EF020B137F4A66F
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
0x5841246233FAB7E50C9FE914A79FD8BA
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
0x97F76E3829830D2688A9FCA6D4D9FF5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
0xFE3F0506C3BD00091B3D07A39A423BAF
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
0x3A52A46A6A5ADF2F578C91867263BF1B
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
0x16A87CAACD3992EA026D6663D369CD45
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
0x2FE8412285BBE96663386AC678145B13
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
0xFEA81E3712785E7C19DFEC036721B115
flatter me."
0xB10A3ECF64ABE37BD3C7E316D72FBC12

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
0x5D47CE74A0B00F9BED29BD0EB8663AB0
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
0xC637297DF3291D8C9407FD200B701D98
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
0x149B56AE49DBE4C02DC17A65B90114B9
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
0x362A3B829C452D76BC0D64688D49100F
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
0x8FA8673C03DDF6C9E1D60F41A4D48691
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
0x79AA0CB131523B7F53C841393957914F
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
0x21500CD6644F72C2F924CAADA8103E78
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
0x5600EE1C558DF33AA51377D820BDB937
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
0x19E749AFC88E444023B0287109EAB3A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
0x85E791C8F813D53DCC17932788A80FC8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
0x7A4382C04AF5510762BD69B7C5CC29F1
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
0xE0F8E30499715AD7D87B616B4FBB3396
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
0xF1E4ACFE7154F543671538A6CFDF78C2
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
0xD8CBD7ED40FC4A0F13D41D8555495500
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
0x0669BAFFF92D11BD78BBA75AA818602E
as my comforter."
0x1708CEC8CBBA8960A3E077870C021956

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
0x7AE2643ABF182129FAE8749F1D4313EE
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
0x8AA5FE345504AD4B82072045E258EF84
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
0x22B7CC4E1ABBB934B4064DFD7603404F
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
0x59D928EAD7A6ADECF3D4D9E1945FF07E
anticipate."
0x0220CFDB89DDFE7F4F08FB658B03F0FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you anticipate of me?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
0x839066587064C5A9CFD5CE3C2219BC36
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
0x72E563F0E4F1F887E8A3193393274531
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
0x21C4E8AF192644DAC64C50A658ED7C62
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
0x8CD95C2E3B024958FFE5F4F8832B1405
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
0x142A3D01FE0A790A4179BC5304310162
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
0x703C7B9EBE47F8D965E2E196165EAA8D
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
0x6287B2B36B50009E2A7A1EC52A0C8C63
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
0x6A738E338C883AD86D4F1BB2B111805C
dear master."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
0x8DEC8D8A552E928B81EC8659CD12025C
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
0x9DBF1E74E3849773EBC2F62A96979A27
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."

"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
0x29BCA511267343FAED3829C37DBB95E8
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
0x592D68E29A7686AE86B6997DC5680983
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
0x93AE93C584ECB027ABFEEE250E35CCA1
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
0x17F083DEEB58F2B2F0218FBEDE9801BB
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
0x7836530912C45D24A5A9CF5DA6349931
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."

such an one?"

seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
0x76B0989F74F34A7C97BA1B3034E29B23
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
0xFCEB7E77CBF31A2569D13A27E808B285
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
0x948138B6C0EB1D3CFE1AD01E09C47B38
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery

beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
0x3824D630090DA936036CB3E603C5F8D4
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
0x9C25D4D18FAC90806390334093062001

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
0x020466F9CC06A11FD69239B7DA3A9018
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
0x90EA5D78649D4E5B2631ACFC95181FD8
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
0x24245E1B701063B7D4711106F87E7D7A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
0xD981D831FD6D575E22C4251421E216A0
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
0x3BB33288D2E09D104EFBF6921D91CC43
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
0xAACBE294301770B7B5F77A5565AB76EF
withdrawn: try again."
0xD56AB881FE3B985D4DEB78801B02417A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
0x5A26A55E0A0DBA11F29D17B973F8EF11
piqued on one point."
0x60AFFB0D4C3B2885617493EED526A54C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
0xDC164D36EABBCAFDDACF9ABD9D2B9C58
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
0x7F6DF1BFF12A993E43AD7F602DA23D69
request--"
0x95A0A12EFB88B0B4F508E7320490EB46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
0xE341E5F06AC34F80102EE345D122E82A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
0xECB68571AD4502C8D2D42BB241F7FAF2
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
0x7CC5444C3B92F803F58ABB5849D67A21

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
0xDBB1427B1551EBC63014CEDD3C0849A3
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
0x166F36D4E6EF2CFD6D561B6CC9B5F68A
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
0xB37EF34F6EF467F0872EA7E855168D6E
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
0xD3127B81FFC4221D60837C0BACDDA494

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
0x52384F91850D721C99D146C1EE5B4EE4
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
0xC66603BCE3FC93827FDF209F69F92295
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
0x32D0C4F72A4D312FD2BAB5FFAB8A5974

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
0xE20D7D2D297A2BA6771DE676C356E7C8
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
0xD3FBE6A7C296AB4498A09FD353D7DDCF
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
0xF5153D676E62AB0E7FE128BBFDB6E7E1
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
0xEB6CAEA6DDFEC5AEF264FE52C09D280C
of my power?"
0x74762B8B2E5414320ECB4E431E02921C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
0x113DA5F880519D07E0E1A65C4FDCAA75
up."
0x1F9C777E1F9C777E475C264ACF061BF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
0x645FEC51C7104469932680CD32764E31
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
0x440883F79B8430D422727006C8FBF8BE
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
0x224E676D93DE06C8BDB77CC2D46E74E2
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
0xB7DBDCDCA9B0A3CAC7BCE7B8CA9EF6E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
0xFAB9055B644D26165FA6EB3BB7DCBC88
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
0xBB12EE0299114FED9E15E253FBC36C18
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
0x884C884A2605D6D62032A42A1940E222

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
0xF07444C011A97D629D59138C920079A2
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
0x971B787051E30F3981584AE5F80C8F28
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
0x5381F23632405302C36F61ABC2BCC278
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
0x0C03AA13AB9D21B3E05F5C19A997D7EA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
0x6A7F787D8DDFDAC073E6C2E714D908A6
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
0x76ED37BA1EADC7FE25A8DE5EEC3426F6
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
0xFF6AE2732AE81ED34A407BEE6B407BDD
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
0x87D33E1F22458378F6A5672E5583A6EF
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
0x72369C62466C89E08CCB33ABFDF1EB23
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
0x7287207F8E97972DACA5C94BD39BA9EC
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
0x88DCC9FCBBE023B30B6679F991F5E46B
made me the offer."
0xDC16DEB2FF6AE5905D772346A6D82007

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
0x29FF5D167066883B44D094B9F945B66B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
0x3222EAE36E17C8B578942196BB64CA60
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
0xCA71D6BE414C72713D9B01BCFCD18DA7
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
0x56D332934918865CC95E2CA57B295DA5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
0x6FFDECF4BA19679424B88B0BDD8D8348
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
0x0BDF1B8C351EED9C1073F1496EB58071
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
0x315A0E4A6EB108BAAA2689628FCA49B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
0xA98BE85760BDB3AA3EFDF1C54C3D51DD
Were you jealous, Jane?"
0xCBCD637A9EA49B64B7C23DA4F1E3DE83

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
0xB1D2A0B1C653F296FC8FF9556C593D22
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
0x9389A4055543A92F2E60596627FCD35D
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
0xCFE46E3E9FA5FF8A43EA52B9FDB46603
deserted?"
0x1FC596B10FFF617F9B4F0EE9CB22F710

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
0x698B4581D8F78307C6D28540E5EB25B6
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
0x24FA04A5EEC22D1AAD3B4BF76CBE7BE2
moment."
0xB88038E05591617B20FFBE84B014992A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
0x061C1482D9AA0E77303F3A88F4FBC06F
principles on some points are eccentric."
0xFF0065AF4374BC7567BA1DA6057D3783

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
0xA13BA5E7C76F0CD34C45BA55D376F7D7
awry for want of attention."
0xDDBC06A51AFA748E5D5DAF91142F9DBA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
0x84F1C18A1A4BC2E8DCDC6A13CF883BB4
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
0xF8A9138A087FAFCB838FDEC7FD90854F
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
0x09F52A1791861FC1B533F117C7855F6F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
0xF7AC7690C5FD948341642226D384276F
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
0x26365E2AE458457FCC2689368A9FB72D
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
0x52857F9318F9350500EF0D52ADC35735
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
0x7B3C6AF0E024E6BD2AC9F029C4FF5DD8
express.
0x82ED833500C09590D1D01BB2A7F549C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
0x0C69DFBA0FAF34404A95255F4B823549
entreated, and to yield."
0x900C4FE4D8A8A5A32CDD5B511BE9A344

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
0xF5EBB6E4F44576FE1F9F6FF8B5E05AB5
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
0xCA87EA1D3C71BF8DA1B2A7341A0AA946
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
0xEA9A857D3592F1E11B97E0DA0906A7F4
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
0xEE2C2E97AC46682AE3A20F2B287062CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
0x33E1A63D5BADA2A3861263A54183139A
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
0x31550789C4D1E21018583969977A5280
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
0x357FDBA023C7AE7D425E30048EFBA25F
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
0x7EB252848F6A52E7DAC76B4695B9B326

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
0x4C7592B9D36400D39E554F60FAC78FF1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
0x849A3CD06C915A349D86806FCE3EB950
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
0xE3F0CD91F300F95F9372CBF9A4B93C7F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
0x079D0D73D4A094557EC11A0297979634
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
0x9B47D8F3B5C1B97D932DD4775B508B60
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
0xC500480C8A442856017218DFCC289373
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
0xFA305511ECB143A5343B7EAC9FCF5AF0
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
0x515442AC7FB852DA0D174BF006615E67
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
0xCDD4EB5489BBA6A4758ED6934CFCF169
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
0x5D2D341B513E9D520837C6D1F2A8B65A
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
0xA20657AF75BFE8E4D3F9109A58FB9E41
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
0x807BAA3BCA925769F919F0A5F611C5F3
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
0xCEAC2934A51766EBC4CEE05C301F7F4D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
0x56BD4D8978B49F038707C16E08676DBC
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
0x3B36AF5477F810F26450560A7D88A0D9
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
0x5116A0807858E367ADE1958C301007B3
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
0x1BD43C4D9DFB3DCDACE36C7957D51752
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
0x8451E645AB38423E05A3AD13E57D5C0A
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
0xD6CF7FF8BD567509EF00B418A2ABC87F
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
0xFD06FE2845FE898ADEF2E08D03B84A36
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
0x9106DE69BE71570048AAED1096332AA7
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
0xEBD8A0473A998C87642DC5BF73FE65FE
you would be his wife."
0x611124981F1538A8BE3B13BB63DE6EB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
0x6775B29AE113C2EE7AF775C694940C46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
0x8E1293AD152E32AE96CC73AD02A52E57

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
0x965A6DE4F5F165EBD55D46D194D216C9
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
0x81CEB0C5EA273BF4321DEA5122C35A62
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
0x0611E150CFED229A930B6CE077912E0E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He tells me so."
0xC0A2DDEA2E17CA415098861464032066

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
0x612A97F4AE0F8B0A4280475A39AD6057
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
0x4129B034AA0D379557C33CAD41C70289

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
0x36BFB4F399F956E9604A3609563C7C0E
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
0xC11C5A14BF385CEAA9033EA246DC3995
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
0x1B7199228449199067BEB37DE231ED63
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
0xBF85BE0A144C5764BA25AB3BA69AC9FE
father."
0x4C8DFF99928336E6A64B32F1E8E90738

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
0x036FE4884D4FAA0D2B5CE014FCA4548B
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
0x92EBC9CD86E2653146F86D6FBD4387D8
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
0x6FA4AE3BE7D7AC5F7EBE0CB5AA3A6BD0
twenty."
0xC56D88B69DD53FB219DBD3BD648D5404

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
0x21DF0959C4B463A557421A6C69BD044F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
0x4C107CC6992323FE3FF820C4699C3B45
eyes.
0x9402AEBE9402AEBE44400E2D3555417B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
0xA8EBE20C4EE71063D41AB83BB59019CD
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
0x43F119F70A33B22A192C93BC198F2DDB
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
0x9D237BDB41AC94AE0F3C26922A80A252
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
0x847E1EE2DF6D22382E0A981FB8FB05E1
I expect."
0xAB22365C743383C40174F541342CC323

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
0x878080460479AC81A5177037C2CFBD4D
should have a sincere affection for me?"
0xDF8FBFFA608CD96DC372355AB6415A3A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
0x2C2E38F5756C8C057BAD7D335F234B00
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
0xF39D1CC2F85318EBBB4C9E595AE8E630
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
0xD8CED670FE854DB185E1641437A5E114
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
0x9D68511F1914BEAE5093D6BBC70A258B
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
0x57CFEDAF21432100B61C1C98E03FDEF2
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
0x4376BFC323882E65409FB10BC18D88BF
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
0x6D28B4D5ABE84CD35400A2B091881DD3
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
0x5EE1658D0E6390EB57A789A6910E2224
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
0x55BC9122CE1B40C12272EE3850A36565
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
0x89909D1BF6CAEB8F3D1EFCD926732E73
him."
0x633FEE44633FEE4486E8D0CF0A1A0996

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
0x8A1F3CE14B03E001A71948DB567A33E0
that all was right."
0x1626A870BE13E411792E9B9633D1BECD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
0xA18F9296660E489FDBE763F91BC8DC86
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
0x8B0E77DCF1E18F6B5FF2CBC85CF955C1
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
0x547AD7EB60195C09D13C431D3DB0164C
accustomed to marry their governesses."
0x78DDD249D81F0D694E37AB04FEB012FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
0xA97D098B7CB5BAE4230E28A147A9A857

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
0xE0D9509B48FA79CD77AF3C7F44965B13
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
0x0950A2A67BEB172C0BC43607D96DCF86
me go mademoiselle."
0xBF9F3788837D1DD2DDB2D057AA3621E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
0x2F5244F957DDEB4972955004EEC7BDA5
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
0x87A29F1EA769A8885407153151515C2C
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
0x8A65D134F802178464B0CCD54A648669
backwards and forwards.
0x376953CFB92A3C987605BD311CCA8A4E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
0x42D7A05069BCB140ECFDDD903EC900B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
0x39C289A5AA70CC66CC629E3B88734B88

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
0x6CF844F05FE7CF7E4884C854EB97C341

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
0xB08C273847464852D52B4ED7F30303A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
0x46265CF57F36983FBE935263C8592EA1
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
0x41DA019F681A73F8035EAD8C86CB90AE
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
0x951C61F50FF34E30C5A93EA03F2BCFD6
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
0x9E32F6AE8F775603B98AAF6DF1CDB15B
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
0xE198587C9632F69A25355462FC1A7078
my face.
0xDACB61FF127197664467FA8D6ECF0CD4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
0xF2ECF1B0EF9C6B25C81639E4F671BBE4
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
0xC01A513CA8DED9BF1E41D4784E422B41

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I would far rather she went, sir."
0xD708731EB388460B8FBF2A1FBAF933A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
0x21FD4A40B3287F14514FFC425A30CCC2
to Adele.
0xF589BE207865C9CEEA7F8F13D8159A8A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
0x97E711070B5418BF2E607FEB3FC84DFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
0x9A956CB2EDF1B9DB34B2782C75E0F713
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
0x2E5BBDD53413E5D231C705140F000FFB
company--for life."
0xF02C7E946FAB6152A39AA064EB2849BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
0x3FDC92FBCA257CF1F164AEC6E5BF4904
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
0x156198ED88B98390A1DE23B3BDA5BD40
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
0x6380BBCD4E5FC02A900F884F07EA743D
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
0x2AA79D080365D013282B3FA359004910
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
0x3C269A4BA4A201B7619A4E7A45C07B0F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
0x5E92B7D96EB11DFACDB172BF942063BC
there is plenty of room on this side."
0x6AA8CC8613CBE7E1B13DA8840E1FAFBD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
0x5C708F819E8D281FF6B74A2A7BB75C52
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
0xF55296B30BA26B50EAE8BAEB59246465

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
0x829C4E90FE66091F562DBEB9C32A94A0
mademoiselle?"
0x9DE85517C775224592A454971ED849EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
0xBF20314D4C3482A285458F540D816488
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
0x6D3208413A9D48D006014272F66CDD19
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
0x471118E6201449ABC00A283F3E48DE46
there, and only me."
0x13B2B16E47C0FEA79C853C5870F16B39

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
0xD7DCC214B71E7B7C4D910519E0677086

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
0xF0F38C42959818592289E9E3887A0418
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
0x4AAD1946D76558C475447B913102944C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
0xB9E0BD8EBA75F5B6CF782A64AE30319D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
0xAC1BED564243F077CC03C5230358D782
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
0xEE99BB510DB070669F3C407951B3DBD3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
0xA375483E4D3F13E4D0613F1FC6BE8D1D
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
0xBCDE8254DFD6F900782211797E73F0F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
0x77AA79077EBD38C7178808DD93417283
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
0x849CF55BEE6686EEF15C58BD543A5EE7
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
0x28818DB0B3C3EEBE45629F59B0C11677
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
0xEB8782A4F7971FFC7D10A21E1AB61D67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
0xC3D5C9FF1E03B83645271495D8A31745
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
0x33FBD481B6555720D9C25F9632C72574
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
0x1ADDC616C322AE0071DF81F1729F0F40

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
0xA307F66045F903BD39293A014B9CFB7D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
0x8B54CB549D89EF71B94ED59E0E4054B9
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
0x7E24771CF7B18264044184CC897AC39C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
0xA03E9B33AE481BC158E66697401C545C
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
0xFBA79DE87B1FEC1BE0EA5F912C2BA0DB
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
0xDD769FA0FD300FA6CA5ED7F500918D3F
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
0xA73EC3FF5E1F5BD3E47EC8E5326EADBB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
0x7CD0BCCBC3241D71856689964E41620F
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
0x8693B41DC659872220F7BA2657E62ECA
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
0x2EDC467580F400A286F4DF9AD5DE837D
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
0x4CA615D865EB5664DAC0FBB47B4EAB2A
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
0xD3114A96E0FD587DDFC746B717E1130F
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
0x7226357AB0DA8642F45A1B61767797D5
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
0x7246EE93DFE4B21856A343615C4A28B2
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
0xB4BE282C6713444B490180A4F0C39F9B
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
0x91563B97DD7D4ABF077DF2D4CD371BD0
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
0xC9E316E3C9F7BB3346CC0F8A9F24BCE0
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
0x025122FF161F60A9BE487134E408BFD7
effect--
0xB862FCF58D21F1FDD0EF0FEF396B8E1F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
0xF52ED512031E751BDFF5A3141DFA487A
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
0xF48CE2C3E30E9D8F138414E26D647B2D
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
0x4DB03AB853BC22C0177690AEBD7D04AA
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
0x5ED30925AECEC5A8778811CBBA335E8B
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
0x242AB7CD8B68A3B680CE3A612709CEA4
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
0x76D49826AE60B889ED9C035849AA0D5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
0xABA9D864A7EF650E0831908AAC18CF17
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
0x673C09508BA0F405F1272210A1E88583
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
0xD50067AF08E81D396C4F524BFD98304D
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
0xA7C660A49ACA6B3FC048B0723647910C
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
0xA221D08D0A3E1E5ACCC5A09B2AFBB59E
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
0x8FD82B3CF547D1E72AE0824285613D8D
again."
0x57CDF6B557CDF6B513F81F7B4C5CE6D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
0x7911EAE938F0CCBFE296BCC2AD18B93C
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
0x38C56ABA4251E752A2F5FB685C30DA43

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
0x2F1204B204D12ADAE58C0B03D98D8306
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
0xDFAE554FDCA326BFB6A5AFDECBDC2952
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
0x8D0BC63D36802C1A35B5F8DB1F48F02B
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
0x19418D6265EAAF44484A8C2C73BFF72A
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
0xF52D2EB50E9920D3A0631339F21F3EA3
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
0x39B4BAA27A0ED394C40540EB069A31BA
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
0x7505960C6F28BD710FE924AD8EBACA0A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
0x94171713D5A954DBDA9840D974F2F6E6
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
0x9A9F100DBCB98177BB5F3A0E6DA9F920
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
0xEA6FE8343AF6348A3575796DB8CB3819
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
0x6C64209D02918214E0F3657144FCA932
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
0x97A9CB2F279805A3495389DACB032342
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
0xA2A0EA52E17A9ED964459165BB06DC7C
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
0x7B979236A3D8BA8FAEC6CF8DDDA8CE80
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
0x02B6D072115BBF101878FAEC72D601A5
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
0x772645F5105561E64529A8C6EE59C940
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
0x4CA4CD832549502C984B65E079DB4116
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
0x7898876535592FC9B812DC47D09CE8F5
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
0xA7964268B55338E0678E100FAA35DF58
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
0x9F0F4336D7C3FB3148B9EED953BF898B
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
0xFDB1366EF928C6DB578080D50EB3BF00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
0xC24344E5153F7505F8950659F7ABFD93
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
0xA39D1A616D3A3EA0AF3B45C584DD17D1
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
0x3FFBA042FCC3BF471F89FD1CDEB533A5
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
0x32416F62F137F5A1DFF9790C6273B0DB
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
0x9FADE92C78189B91A22371EC3F39E9FB
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
0x91002EB639649A5754A0C1960BC7DBC1
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
0xD7847CE48BDE58C5550C5D90D2F2C944
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
0x475AD8BC2E59575595D240B6E16C9B82
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
0x1E221D0C4E7F51D3FDCA112FAAA6CB76
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
0x67C6A4C5F61589AC38E9A0BC365BAB22
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
0x991DADFEE86737357A755D9596FD4F7D
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
0x73424D90DE0B0922116E3AEAD14AE49B
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
0x70774EBCCC5792ADF4A012750639A5C2
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
0x9492273B66C8B8CC8E2A209A34133D3D
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
0xDB3A46D84D5027FC446D05BD056CF8D0
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
0x92A81E670D13DBED78874FCBC998ADEF
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
0xC466B57A1CB63D83FDF3F81600829B5E
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
0x06B84813CDC259208B2049AEFB5F869A
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
0xFFDEDDD870B7E76FD809E49A1E1F66E2
passionate pressure.
0x91773D8AEADF07483F4D4CCC2C11C8A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
0x7D64128E9722B7527B3CA5F7DD8E8C71
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
0xBC9AE9BACB6F0CE1A97A5EE1A2EAA49B
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
0x972014872CB17B58FE5C775F05B06297
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
0x02A07D4F1E94997D3B0C3721A9E955AE
satin."
0xA2DF4314A2DF43142CA806CD4B7276BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
0x057721014E4C51F0F1F8ABD1183D4FC3
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
0x9BE648B9C766AEA698E1BE5D8F451479
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
0x2C249CDC577087DA74CF9B5E16B622DC
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
0xE1857D7CF02C094730D5523DB8FFDD01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
0xDE752EEDF2D4D647ADB464915224570D
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
0xC523535CF79E2602B7B4EECD302DF1EF
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
0xC41CCF19968C71B6D8719BCB9C582CEF
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-

0x8DDC22BF2C21457ADE51CCA9E16010DA
satisfactorily here."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
0xF45E27DAC6F235671D9EA0482A6D9C1E
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
0xB4268A5588FB35C71E80F52F5805523F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
0xF7CA0F646E05ADE2C4A35AC5A6D55F61
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
0xA5053B79CD863D5E3ACF1E74BD8FC168
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
0x58AD03AE6A3867210ED76020DF1CF293
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:

nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a

"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
0x9B381536A3B5504376739E5BBC72C018
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
0x211D825BAE18C22D11B96B3C243D55AD
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
0x9B838778DAB862A4E4C87C697391204F
would be to violate its conditions."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
0xB81FB99FE0CAC2FCCFD868D456F27F31
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
0xE677040B6E50B2BC18FEFF64374B5126

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
0x9374BA131FAEC65B2A8AEF8F40E433AC
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
0x4D86D70C7D7CD08B3895B9F2470952FD
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
0xBD9F2CF88B4D219A536D4F51F5413DFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

companion of my repast?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as

usual for another month."

"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with

it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
0x0D0BF8FA7592AC473A46BDA129828E94
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
0x60B96C8DF6CE08F69A9A3CB0F2C4A569
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
0xF28426E682C886442CDCB5DDDEBB32E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
0xC4A97B2EF6B2C15E6B243EF922DFA931
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
0xA8C9BB9A20F38525B1BD7E361DE764E1
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
0xA81E6594C75719300206F38CF18D52BF
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
0xA1FAF8775D4BD0C41B0E8746E2BD5823
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
0x5B9CC8ABFCCBF883ABE1977FC0214DD4
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
0x1D3A09ED6F9F3F49F237192EA90B32B6
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
0x8347FE743A574466D3EE159B9AD034EA
my jewel I should tyne."
0x9069A322693231F1F4848677DACE3E20

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
0x0CA23099CD51346DAE8603FB595C5904
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
0x4C6080148345C530172D6C890FC94A52
retreat upstairs.
0xA9E28E5EF3AE6A7496144F2CBA8DAC01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
0x7A21C5F52946BF6DFBC189B96C0230AA
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
0x4D0D30F8778B924B36465329A309B636
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
0xD9DD2FBF62D7627D6E3F14E97B7A7649
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
0x2C67C67718FE8744FEDB5797E32D08E5
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
0x146B40DB431CCD2764C874C5D2E2B7A5
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
0xA2C4E77AA417B7BDB1DB25855CF96273
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
0xCB1AE7A983FB635C88EABC4E18C05230
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
0xFE5BB81F67BE58A246AF2050CD97D674
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
0x10583C1B1AF05DF959108365EC94DCE2
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
0xF71C41889958A97AA37D1A35048609C2
the present.
0x1FE52B63B37B039F10571077BC35EB6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
0x2E79C165F4AC42BA4E0FCB40AD5659D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
0x203CCF0BBA0DC024CA5A0776C34CECA8
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
0xCB699DCB28D9FB5E09B7500EE89A1F1B
stimulate it.
0x36B7E5EBFD86BF78B09B566D9C68B441

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
0x9922F8C136C3132488646D1C162C4BA2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well, sir, I will try."
0xC53FAE2487FD40E97E6952247F91750C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
0x88C3C36E342C78CBAE50846753BABB4A
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
0x70749E0581972C85C2F856E93B1CD1DD
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
0x96C451712F55A4932BA22CB64F9C8D9A
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
0x4666307ED901694F5620E12BA3840F8A
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
0xA79E3A78A0754E8AEABC56AAE85EB019
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
0xC92CA0F3967C876C65997EAAC18BD855
strain:--
0x049BF7BCF0DECE333DAE7063485E6E52

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "The truest love that ever heart
0x8A8DB21C2385633B36EEB4E80384DA43
      Felt at its kindled core,
0x1F7C9438DEEF0023E21D940AAB0E3F7A
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
0x66EC0F4B568BEC2B7706E8F574A32397
      The tide of being pour.
0x9D7FC615BFC89AC61AC856597AF0763E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Her coming was my hope each day,
0xA3B0BB1B984E646DE00CA0B88FA13EA5
      Her parting was my pain;
0x915B63840C0B0540BD8F658FF57C51BC
   The chance that did her steps delay
0x74683E39B3A14F71E23A8634B621E7C4
      Was ice in every vein.
0x1739870E3CD0F8D901D2FE4844C692CC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
0x6CE1E453D13803602DD67C3077B3160B
      As I loved, loved to be;
0x8A35D2A5044D452E6F3B872E065D8285
   And to this object did I press
0x53EF7A1C364F6D4BEF9337132781E73E
      As blind as eagerly.
0xD72940EC4764006B9267FE096C13B7F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   But wide as pathless was the space
0xE32CB7997F80826711BBF5E4E13DF6C6
      That lay our lives between,
0x0F3BD5C6B38F047D83A05C106C1656E1
   And dangerous as the foamy race
0x5C1BF932DBF1C8019964278E49130B27
      Of ocean-surges green.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   And haunted as a robber-path
0x0CE9A466FD2C7BD5F75527AE7F5FD3AE
      Through wilderness or wood;
0xC81F1EAE948758217F5FD02907C0A3ED
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
0xE6E9E67A8A30EF792BAC8C6D5C4ED8A4
      Between our spirits stood.
0x7ECDB40F098097D1D8F97248761BF81A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
0x64B1835931E8DAD02BC985D50EFBE225
      I omens did defy:
0x461B0F69BFE07CF62F037B5ADB9D6040
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
0x7CEF6BDAEFE69EFD291A328C453EE27A
      I passed impetuous by.
0x2C760A68EB450535FEF7B87BA2F4D3C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
0x127F63FFE0D441DC319CD61CF501F69C
      I flew as in a dream;
0x9B327DDF19BD6E2337F24AEDBF2E0E58
   For glorious rose upon my sight
0x13F62A0A7DC3B664D674D6FF4BC7004A
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
0x0A8BF7679C8D758326D89C634BEA5D4F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
0x20C222B3B84EED5572AB50CEFA68A7C5
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
0x02A2E9320B671902FADB58BEF71113EA
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
0x2CF6802E11C5EEB6F840010551DFF5DA
      Disasters gather nigh.
0x0DE0FA1561BF631D97A238517F129D3A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   I care not in this moment sweet,
0xE39F3CD95A47D57514DC2AEFC95BF671
      Though all I have rushed o'er
0x21355E92DAAB30E940FF507D1DFD50BF
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
0xE85F8A7FBC009EA57245E25A57E443B7
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
0xCEA0676D7CB1FB767B11AA08523B2667

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
0x015E603CB985238F4E89084F8CDFCD52
      Right, bar approach to me,
0x9E0926DF7DA3B759D44E275B0444B783
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
0x93CD7D4B8EEB51505D8691685F12196A
      Swear endless enmity.
0x8875417960F557F80DA21F29F676E307

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   My love has placed her little hand
0xC0BAF615B284935277174871622F418D
      With noble faith in mine,
0x7F4C9C4F4219B3D2D88777D1DF0C36B8
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
0x65E8C037334A819404DDC5392C326CEA
      Our nature shall entwine.
0x6A698C6B3C6D26ED308E4A4EA266E994

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
0x23E8637A138E36E9F8350BBE5E64A701
      With me to live--to die;
0x8208EEF4AA63C3C179144AAC321DCBA9
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
0x65619D692517AAE62A3AF63D5B7179AE
      As I love--loved am I!"
0x716648D91D68F3D3DDA9707720D371D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
0x38F009F2048EDC5E77EFCF61A797DFD1
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
0xB005597D183AAC45A0DE33B2F58E7196
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
0x68B6A65B9E19408633C0DD2CDFBCFE22
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
0xC44711B3F4A182CE83BF1C1BE816554B
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
0x432E14D735BC89C5A3029E244C9F2EE8
"whom he was going to marry now?"
0x60C0C7C242FBAE02E0C4E08AD6B7F623

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
0x83F0867AF2A2EA9D11D0526C9C72E07B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
0xC098339C742F528A32F83D63CB282544
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
0xEA5B3A49EA86D26492DD834457548066
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
0xA0FEFF26E4BAAD900F9D844F220F8893

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
0xFB3270A5405993C27F3A2A000DDD2714
Death was not for such as I."
0x32DEEB0AEFB923E914F5ADB9E7C48A40

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
0x453448B8B1D868CCE371D655F93B369E
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
0x712773D09549FE9CA9EE87E6C4CB98C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
0xE72D485E7F88AFCCF9E91DED00B42E91
reconciling kiss?"
0xEA01B4876092B610631908D7D5371670

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: I would rather be excused."
0x3FD3FD6B873007F1D7002652C7D7E102

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
0x1C8E0A9407287E06495BBC0471B4AB1A
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
0xA78530822FF8235D58137438F9D164F1
stanzas crooned in her praise."
0x4DF8F67C4C486C7BC7A6DB5C43C2BC60

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
0xA3D3736DDD6CAA126ED91013CBA5E146
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
0x889D4726D4F184F816873F7E434D8EF8
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
0x9A107E789E73FC29ECF14BD2ABA79171
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
0xB876019838774B81D047C187F722E7A0
time to rescind it.
0xF95CDF4FD612FFE26169FC78650B7DF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
0x0DA86321AFBA026EA80974E0120BE997

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
0xB46361F8A73933262F9307B5BC901837
myself I was doing that now."
0x9BB7EB1CFF9DB37D279F99DE7ABBC55D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
0x6B880EFA489244B71B9D23FCD3FC53D9
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
0x2A00D32170690FAD42B07D244DFE8B66
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
0x7B0B81BD7FCAF331B48A0FE15D2E7D72
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
0x18C058657FA4F6794644CAF0A7DDF4D0
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
0x70C20C564524FC7B8D1913260284B607
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
0x8F24F09272C8998247D0B9751016DD60
advantage."
0xE16A38DB30C6C7790117FF66FF956F65

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
0xDCAB7794613DE847BBCBC0D285174470
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
0x0127A6E0FBB7EB9071E947814396B3B8
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
0x1ADA593FF78ABD1BA77F9E5C1F22F9B1
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
0x49BC008B5D500BA4F11DBE3FD475B72D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
0xC3AADD098CF7B99D870A52C5172201A9
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
0x1EAF470AEDF7F3B9858EAFC255801313
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
0x2AEBAA3430E6A59B738EB1CAC91DD78E
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
0xF48693598468FC41D09F540EC63A2BC5
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
0x2903DB21449884D498707D5983B9E791
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
0xE1DF9BECC729FCAA2289D292260C7148

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
0x76C0615DEC56032EE7BDD4901C58F628
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
0xE9796B64083BEDDA3E4CD678433273A8
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
0xB5600439C51E3FC7BCAF2455197DF4A1
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
0x6C700D684BAE700293BCEDE5002AC550
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
0x5131969C063CABA58549CA8808393C14
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
0x14F4BB8B2ABFFDE4FFC7AEB706B3F378
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
0xFA527F8A83546A7094B5123CA7549E61
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
0xD39359233642D35E35BF0AB6E7F35F28
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
0xCBABB3667C7C7C778B06F8386D9D52DC
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
0xFE8FCBDAFE780F9986616797BDEDEDE4
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
0x6683225D4C902CD9BC6037F320B355C8
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
0x7D6886B0FFBBAC7238320E18B56C7C3F
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
0x358AA4F20329113CF2ACB6996F343C95
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
0xF485F9BC0BBAE25ED5C8F755A3957A3D
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
0x9FB87A2E7F2347C7D9B50E217BE16D8F
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
0x6F5DABB57CE39A92739B70762FB7A25B
virtue, another must be devised."
0x33FD201F3EDFDCBA54CAEE08991BCFDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
0xE92BE66204F77587A8031D0D3FFA4728
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
0x86890CA1D3965C61189AF17E8990D393
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
0xB5A99883D87BF8F6CE9D17CE6A6E8E39
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
0x30366A85BA79E0FFE9E22E7287FC15AF
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
0x86826D4D0BA73E553F9DA13AA80BA9B6
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
0x20D01D45CCF2C708AD550D479D4DBDB7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
0x8DFD0EDC325DB6BD2552E4A8A6EBDC43
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
0x84AA549E0127CCEF1A0AA6EC243133E4
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
0xF7B6D5E567E82020A09F53752A7A3DE0
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
0x76245CA11D77EA88B4042AAFAB60A59B
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
0xAD1FDA76F0312A2B64750581DF306ECE
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
0xC724CDF6D0580918FE5D42AF49621160
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
0xA4F1C56DC54594595A7E921D14DCFEF8
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
0x6E3E92E4AB7C0C5EF77BE0C871FE10A8
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
0x1F28FD2C2DF2E0139B6778EF97F26F42
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
0x6002F309FC2D15906E9BF7C86F1725D1
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
0xE950D701839648AF562A022465DB549A
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
0x2F8196C866153AA72BBCE518D5B04919
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
0xCB31657244880784314D4A7C2653C8CE
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
0x17424DB6CDD70E8D928B94977305D1AC
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
0xD58164917AB2858EA12BF9683E4E0225
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
0x994D8D585F1181F92999496E0ECB8A13
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
0xDEAD0B1D95255E80FA73F1E9EBCED532
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
0xAFABA4C2A51114CF04D5160E4696E10E
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
0x82A6D9067F30D8BF59B96559CA6BDC1D
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
0x5F9D8E3B41FDE8F194DF90F043D0BC51
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
0xE9C0F18B2E976BD61CCD0BFDEE7D9231
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
0x46894698D195660904CBE8B2E3CF372A
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
0x2B755362996A3062F50BA6D231A7EEC5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
0xEACDB5ABC75F5AC01789F71A9C9BED25
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
0x775C1CE6A20CE5C78ACF312F2EF7863D
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
0xB97E2B134AFBFC21E6863E04D453CC48
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
0x64991F779E9974C481AFAA4A01E0E5BC
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
0x0BAD14A0C901D8E77F2DA7BD5EBA52E3
more than they.
0x15EBF056ACE5DDBFBA43998A4E7307F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
0x22DB8BFFC87309AA675576246EA72A71
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
0x1B979F7BB136D5A4F8299422E886537A
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
0x7A6EB36D7C81457D4BBA377D126164EC
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
0xB69D4AE863A5A6565C30C28A72281FAC
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
0x05FA0AEDAF4B6679F5107C7B9F715CAA
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
0x2C28B55B3A08A19C49C4D529E69983DA
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
0x2CE6ED00461750ED9BFF5768A79D9C6A
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
0x0ED8B69FEF8E99EBF4DAB334E57BD217
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
0x9885823A77A13C44395B37291492BD1D
to him, you shall share the confidence.
0x27E527D440613E7C94995F7AE49CC60A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
0xBE93C0128661A975BC3F86417AC7BD1F
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
0x3F0FCE8F4B6647E953E2896ABFF19F4B
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
0xDF4A9B7E3250436FA9E50B038DE81AAA
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
0xD9E83CA27DDE9A47ABA242316CE90ED0
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
0xC3D3D0B226EB2C058CA9067D5FEE9A02
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
0x9244E75A9FDAF85DC8B7676C2159BA24
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
0xE31D7125803998D611CBF82FAC376029
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
0xE51646AEAB11212C3A2A33B4C6786DAD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
0x5B89376F870160AC256318F552EF32D2
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
0xD60BBF7296C35E173F3A09F0E3886932
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
0x52FF91C4D160E3480B1201BFD2342D67
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
0x9712A857EB30E245A63D42BC40F8E7DD
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
0xFA672D6CE76D9040377507ED5ECD94B8
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
0xDD71D356AC9BD8073B9A1FBCFA1AEDA1
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
0x6D7AF246809D1D35B398179EA7B557B6
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
0x970856A4934EDCDB584D63DE8BA6AA93
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
0x314BACCDFF1296CE962DA9BB15674922
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
0x9B9FBD73DB1A6D7F8D3F43BFF0FEA9D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
0xBE256E5C7D336ED773D5FB83252A6B31
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
0x07BF65DC6162A0CAC3D9842074B76090
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
0xAC62468F9030F6C026DFF3A5AEF66BBA
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
0x02B354774F9B0348DC366C62DA5E15EA
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
0xB78F7BA4977927AC4C72C39763A2CD9A
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
0x6C160A68E48BCE91656D56D8B2FEE76D
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
0x5392C727901ECA5377B01F3A8EA400A6
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
0x34716ADF53F681B6D18CB9FADADE1964
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
0x3DEEAE730AD70995D65505638E7F52C3
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
0xDFE1D2AB09FFA10FB0E3E54BBD162E42
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
0xDF6D90A2C5DE3D43D6FA969857E298DF
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
0xC61B4385F19221C712C6DD810229F826
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
0x232FFB2A2B8949BC552E4D109811E5CD
listen to, and I ran off again.
0x0B7250C8480BAFF3B432CEE5240A412B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
0xA9B4CAE200400FC433323CBE0E746882
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
0xBFBA56AF0144A59E51C267943D19E0B5
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
0x90217141336780AEEA3B2E65A2A85996
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
0x1091884F24320DA9EF6BFB95778E3A53
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
0x7D64F1AD80D0C3B73ABE4A18E1158EF9
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
0x5098A19B39B82914DE3117FC0C56AB46
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
0x02E95FF6D23CC8A654A28B59B8528679
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
0x710F4331E47B5F4E6900797173455404
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
0x44D62E3D82DC46CB0C06E02AE787BBAA
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
0xD457719A95C9FFE7DC0838B25A98B25F
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
0x537CEB7BD466C37802F15BA972A8EF34
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
0x2E30179528BB567C1DF7D18E3253424A
simultaneously struck ten.
0x7715BF35941FB6D6A4F30EBB9E81BB9E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
0xF3DAF8C900BDEEBF698599C39E6FA60E
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
0x6C2792AFFF0D1EAC4F16E30FEBED282D
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
0x3F5B5BD5931815320C4FEEB34596BBEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
0x121BEE3DAD021093ACA09DF92C49DD71
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
0xE10F820B0C7B23BB648DDFF98A1BE50C
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
0xA1028FBBF3C32218EB052E32DA8E3ECF
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
0x9748119493248B3CFDAB322BB0E5D802
by one moving speck.
0x7653BC3365171A3851A6B8D01E537EE7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
0xC5890465B8B5A1F46CE26EF34EA8F1AB
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
0x9671CD2CB3C7826C137EC8BDB4C89533
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
0x8402A6A2E7F48F239639F12B7FBB8947
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
0x2C860AEC1CE90F55F611628DD5AD53AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
0x719D211F74B58D3FED3B0FA84286AA38
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
0xEED6D9F424B1ABAE39DC301C55B4E865
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
0xC3D9F836427AD8B8ECA2E92CD52332DF
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
0x8F20D82B8EF800D0C672229EF0416610
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
0xCDB73CD1DA5B5F69BCDF2FBC01F1E67C
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
0x04693215C6CF1344A6FC4F3A1EA002EF
meridian, and must now decline.
0x09CE53CCE01BAC65A01E453348A73A8A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
0x2CD5CB0967ED983DDAA1462469B72216
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
0x190197C0EAB049E312173F97C36616F1
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
0xADF90982724EBC7B5BF922A43DB43018

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
0x452DDB42BE761ACAF873859F7B5C3DE0
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
0xEB67BC3E7313FBE0FBB9ED7F432ADCFB
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
0xEB5C1E3BC6AA1F7E4AE03D6526787AD8
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
0xBBD66DDC1E858C8AEE6E26B871F56F5E
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
0x8280C182675FCD1E07FBD03234EB9E3A
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
0xA7BCCA18470C51C6C97954E9A4BD9A8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
0x6D226D4A9F7E408869945F314E5CDFA5
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
0x8A3C48742C579864C3472B8D555A7944
give me both hands: mount!"
0x4D2D06C490D0BBD2F2658109777E5B4F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
0x8547A913807DB007343AE0F089C00AF3
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
0xC339E9FFD0A8C3654B30CE494E6D526D
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
0x158A6160E29C4093B904A514DC31B498
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
0x68DB706D85CFB3C649C888836F895019
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
0x383AB138BFCAB64E4B0E20E53AD5DD2F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
0x444DFC0EB73A21E5A27724E517D9F6DD
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
0x85C6E1505BCE5AD5BABE2D272D80D358

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
0x13970BB933821685E79F2D2B5E8CE1A3
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
0x56749D4D423DAF3395FACC7482CF79EA
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
0x4002606F53A36E824712713FDCCBBFC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
0xC6BDDD2D8817368A8395C729FC9037C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you have been both?"
0x6893496C529CDFC661150C7ED63F06B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
0xCB6C6510A2DC4FF942DA9D65CDAC6099
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
0xF01477434DEE84CCEDDD47FD65D067AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
0x499767BD63E1AE96DA9914AB726CD057
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
0x3710F2A5E6C4C628F7EE162BD1AFA8F3
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
0xFBB810F3802BB1CC22C3DFC5D9E7750A
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
0xBE6A899FF2492C81A56AE0ED5E69C85E
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
0x2F7162D6A959F7E04D704B8A59E64BD6
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
0x5B2F6E60D71A6311DEDCF22087C25841

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
0xAACE5B2F3CD737E8DB949D9CC14CC7CE
get down."
0x1FEBBE8F6E0EFCD4B807A7898CA2D0D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
0x6A5CAA37E3FDF13A4EC55F41301E9ABF
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
0xAF36436E0214D8E8397DB89CC79FD202
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
0xAE129D1DEF0FAD59D470DDB493AEE84F
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
0x4034FB6F0ECC4A0515729780BEC550D9
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
0x040839DDD3A6533DD2AE89198D8700C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
0x022DAA58574B67E8A2CA0ABAA94F0D07
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
0x07264C6A7A71FE123A83DAAA8B328F18

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
0xC36AEA3C6D84D27580C45926ECE02B23
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
0x9A41993813996E7090835D9DA867DB7F
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
0xE3A022312C2AAEB766E303BDA1268768

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
0xC0FE4A59DBF71E46F748F01A889E1BE7
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
0xA6A402FA0923759339FB2CD0CA3B3445

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
0x6C6E739150991794EB7AD34BF97FB44F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
0x9DA7788F27B03349E6D9A5B42EF30EFD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
0x9B632EEA9CC4B761B0DFFC5469F61212
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
0xCCC444AA55151F5DA7D45C8EA1428794
as a long, strong arm.
0xD9FBD42BAC4971BAE6353350C2E20724

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
0xD615605710AF32705B79460670EDCE96
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
0xA1DB330FE481DD47AEDC2F789BBBE194

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Jane."
0x71F2080F0C056635314EDEBA9202AE81

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
0x5B585A75A631955FBD968249B1DDB1B0
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
0x2C2AF2977D781DE830076E95B5347927

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is near midnight," I said.
0x370E35179BEE14EFD37BFBC03932FEE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
0x04FB5A1B2B4466F4E516F885238A6592
my wedding."
0xFC8493738FA8E63FE8B28F9A5A77B832

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
0xB9A9E1DF7F7C0ABF0B56DAD3C9FCD4FC
no wish to go to bed."
0x6330D5A85730FDCBE03102796CBF6A02

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
0xB41683DCBD1D4DE324E7F609127F1D2E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All, sir."
0x492EC9D672837D7AC1264E4FA6ABD147

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
0xD3B287F7B64413D664D9566266BE56D9
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
0xBD5F2C9094E0535D3EC36AABCF67C6AF
from church."
0x0B3113B67B06DBF4CECBDE864BDA64B3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well, sir."
0x0C1A5337A4CBA660DB88CBF09FA7C5F4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
0xF6031B8B29B3A220CF65E2DBE46F39EF
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
0xF9D586ADD1B36388CA35801F2BDAE40D
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
0xE80F479676C74E028E5447A9978356CB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe I am."
0xD569FFE4ADFF520B508608BE210FF8D1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
0x58F77355E219AF474D2397F8E79C66FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
0xAF7B3C96A3F93D0F2C8DBC55A59C3FB6
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
0x72BEBF7C6A83AA110AC6D7D78D7DCCC7
charged?"
0x199986E5936C33C74194B71C7B7E615B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
0xA4DB1BC46E86CC2D6458FE1587742B7C
over-fatigued."
0x8CFFFE4FD73134B3EA0DD0AB6BB6BB29

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
0xDFE4989C01DBCF206A549F53FC845416

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
0xFD41FA917CC0600AEC9E56A72DA02002
and flushed.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
0xCEE2903D2313EC8D82BB541FFEC400B6
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
0xDD9EBB10D1295B25D5105FE89F4D518A
I shall not prove a good husband?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
0x039AB1D986C3683D8FC546B8C111BB57
new life into which you are passing?"
0xA8EFBE5F267E0505C90163CDEAC6389A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
0x0FBF24D7778B65DA4A02D16C39F5A5E8
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
0x51DFCFD4DFDF31E93DEED10A7B3EA08D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
0x77B19256FE572305D681C16B45256951

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
0x9D7CC343FB1DCF75CCF5F5ED1C2A10FD
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
0x9C83596AE1A1CCAD3FFCA8C5E6DCD022
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
0x01DC7D73E19E447CB7D753E1BC630AF9
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
0x1FCC4113E7252443308B5FBD5BEE5DE6
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
0x0D295DEAD46115148D833EAE00F3960A
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
0x03C26DEFA3C88AF7FCA4D1CEB467D4F4
proceeded.
0xA181954B58FA7AA930B0291B632859B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
0x0BC4E03EB64E18A262513CACB4A537D5
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
0x420799C0B9ED774F0ED76A1762EBABD2
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
0x8B686A0C149018831E57D77B2AC7E5A9
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
0xBE5BDD4A13C58CD37997C7DAA56B980F
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
0x2FEB72BD62E56B1EAF55EFBD10B69C1C
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
0x473705108114662F438B35ECF445930F
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
0x3A296DBC1FD3DB3C67323DACD30527BB
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
0x03E154754600CE1B412D8B5590FE4C16
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
0xB6183001BD767D3286BD65BE61561231
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
0x618E588ADBA99FC348622747918E7008
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
0xFCA0495C4D154D56FB483F24C92F9A9A
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
0x59F29EC4ACF8EBF54D5BEE21FB705E1F
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
0x8F5D462C8709D8B448518DE50D179DD6
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
0xABD00EE438307819EB826328EBDAAD41
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
0x46FF455C9B2215D9ECF262C779BEF1DD
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
0x6F5C6036358CB7757359430905A5793C
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
0xDF8E79C296C23C85AD52041BCAE347DE
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
0x93C5FDF37A11EDC48C2CBC6ECB3130AB
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
0x1AD12A15EFF74C2FFDE928DCE4B0460E
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
0x0CFA5FC82D4EFAD277FFA565B383641F
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
0x96DA3851779C22314D3DF989E5634EA8
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
0x5BCEF8E9A4E861C3D33AAF1B93E084D8
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
0x08A3469A9F84CF565A6047EB4FD9E0D5
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
0xDB9742C10909B982154CE2663052ADE9
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
0x269BD0A11B567EC94907B9016BFBCEE8
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
0x5D5BCD6EC68ADF0952022DB37A9A040E
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
0xED61C4932121F0BAF0B143D36991ADA1
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
0x98A7775E1B139748AB0152366152ABD6
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
0x0B2ADEB29E583E57735BF2F8307E0493
coronet."
0x8BC1DBDDB7E78FBF312E97F1334659A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
0x36A609899232BE55F495A80229E74FAF
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
0x4933B4DA41F24CE2F5B39C7CDEEB2CDA
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
0x67FE606A643658A1C3A5165D5554D0FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
0xBAB7FFA519B457EA2D7BB3C682B4F8B0
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
0xE724F55FCE794D4CC0068DDD2ED88B72
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
0xB6D026DF433ECE3DD26CF006066DBFE3
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
0xD8426D06B62254CDCC93D6F21872A39D
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
0x2E363CA93D2FA02F58E9EEDF634C252E
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
0xCAFD7DA7093EC9345187764C38277675
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
0x7E9595C115AF337DF0011EB6C71201AE
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
0x7EAC85D27C28AF70EC5074AABE44F0CA
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
0xC463D417D0D35DE75F6C5E85E4CE0D08
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
0x2E16308A5D994B72AD06E9777B5CC8AA
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
0x0B22C82F5511EDCD809F311BE5E04B29
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
0xB8A11848A8AF7214F70156BE2306E0C8
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
0x13654337214881EE37CB39CB9219EF72
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
0xC918A9DB06FD9DED7897A3093F788822
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
0x5F16B0A296AF8FD33FD9EC3299ACF854
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
0xD1948CB32FD17D6E63B6BF9428EBBF67
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
0x727C9FAE8895AF9C80BF2566332E1321
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
0x7B7A2084B96D89EEB6796F927EF66C14
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
0xB3A81EEA2074E287E06F6A0D0D517228
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
0xD061774435F468AD057822AA01CD7B28
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
0x84DA9107CE70E492D065312B33F3BC1E
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
0x1E43B374581F779950460FD9C3CE6E03
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
0xD644DB317063D539D2B96E8A0C1A944C
moment."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
0xC27F540B856EFC48EB445A81BE0DDEF4
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
0x1BD9FC1DF816D3663151306BD5A21CD4
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
0xADF390435DBABDEA59E5A1BBC9D6FD87
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
0xB8471B7515300E9D1E65D72D2B6F0F35
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
0x8E099552389447F5D98519377F2C431C
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
0x05C43F058070B691C84675388678CC06
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,

Jane?--repeat it."

"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
0x3A9FCF78E05A2BE2BC1EAF8E11A6A06A
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
0x4F1F17C0AB76840591E067F419DEC1B5
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
0x22AF95F34DC250C292625A93A197442B
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
0x35C4EB82C4F79038EF6F81283D3EEB90
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
0x8E8B173500CFC76AD242F2D91F11CA95
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
0xEE39792BC4CE7E69CA074986568183D4
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
0xE45B6891CBC8DC956B6F828FFA34F48E
incensed than saddened."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have

finished my tale: but hear me to the end."

"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source

of your melancholy in a dream."
0x0F01BA99F4993DE8E4935E0ABA1BC052

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
0x4F8E58535B26C5DC17BB228CF62F765D
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."

The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
0xACC31684FB4664A1FA71F9B488C073B2
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
0x31923320588FFD6ECB70A5C579F2E66D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
0x480880FD9208FC3419FD73885364235D
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
0x301054169DC5F86CFC9535E9384AA319
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
0x637B23FD1CCD2B3C97D56B9E04D59C5B
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
0x3B7ED79D0989BCFC2768A9A7629B0CC4
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
0x76B0D908AF78E38365BFB2D38A056765
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
0x5BE07A372359554666B113DF97FBBBB5
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
0x35B67B284F5595D74996837247279B83
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
0x9E9F9E70FB11FA5D13AB358C58C407A0
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
0x51401ECBA8A52F7AC91460C9A3396334
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
0x8BDC24B5B3C350803C204957BF44EC74
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
0x6CC062C62EE9319ABBC757BCB97D761C
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
0x69570BD0372C0D75C3EFB12B3E931814
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
0xCAC8D91242031C4C8ED80D4CE262261A
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
0x2E912CE26B7741F96F5A024A07D0D68F
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
0x94E61FB631D71DB61C93DA14BEE6E44F
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
0xBF975AEFB544A4DDD528BF3123255D3B
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
0x544E2695452E2564588539E5D09BD67F
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
0xBE172FE8DF832F5E36F1618F86E0761E
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
0xEC91B0E4BAE379C0E0D07CF640F76478
woke."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, Jane, that is all."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
0x5A83159C7EF1D057F21AF090BFDE31E6
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
0xAC2A6354D7FA24330B510B1391D3B3D4
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
0x0EBB8237B17C36ACB979FCC3E15DD66E
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
0x4F0989BABA7F1D30DEAA41078E8CEE5F
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
0x34FD4D864DF3A27BB347CE5442F28D5E
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
0x01C0507F6327A0479B5C6F61B40E39CD
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
0xF00B67F9101C6D553C6B1FFD9458B7E5
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
0xEA646733C3FA164393E0D0356E224311
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
0x1088FF063A1D05F73B9E8C56CCFA77A2
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
0x6AFA4E03D616E1A411A28D75B74A2DB1
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
0x5A34F0A60C9435D8F4FE3565BC0D4A82
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
0xB32628E88216BEFA5F91C60396EFCB98
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
0x5CE9D78522A50FF975783C5479FDAF9E
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
0x28C19F447392DE333EC9C5ECBB8B1576
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
0xF5D0CEF4D26D8355A311A9299D828DF7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Describe it, Jane."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair

hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
0x0522EE3477F357EB71303D72F0069F97
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
0x16F232D32FE28BC916392D062AAE7B1E
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
0xA046C509ECC2FB88551E11B6A25AC8A8
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
0xE369BC3BFCDB239781803EB5DDCCD388
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."

0x3E13F4F869C2212940873AB3A705B7EE
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
0x8DCDC667D9ABCDDB22DAFB7245ED6724
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"

approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
0xD574939785B40880DC842DBEF32BEBF3
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
0xF425149DDBD732465DEAAE60FB6D5961
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
0xA80FF97D54FF8020FDD0FDAB1E06FB3A
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
0x3FBAEE9B199CCD42DB99D22816CC04CD
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
0x08A9D2CFCADD9E1EFA8552977322DEBD
from terror."

"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
0x2F91C210D20A071ADF2F627C84EE861B
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
0xE5892AF4DCAA2707854B63D7028EAEFF
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,

mystery of that awful visitant."
0x5981A0F8590A56CB537D21A73A7E4463

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
0x92C41C3CDDB86E61F5191C08EF2B6BBB
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
0x9FAD6E2CEB8DA3D2FFBD3B85B526DA11
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
0x55685635435D65507C096CBF1D98DB30
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
0x49A610F85CD7F9BEB003BD4CD9F493BE
to bottom in two halves!"
0x89D39E8041035CCAFAED8DA971C7E982

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
0x8A03761A5F6534DC26539D06E52A4275
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
0x122C0B44484FB8F57DD9F431EBFF003B
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
0x15653B38D26551FA061C41065222A86F
might have happened!"
0xF3763B57BF1228981DDE229CAB43BDE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
0xF8EDCC20635311AE8D7BEEAA6884A019
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
0x9E366B4CEABBB1DF8D540F27FB9CA8E3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
0x4DBEED51492D623093B1DDCB1A32BCA7
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
0x44F219FE6C4C978E0D18F6B77AABE5E3
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
0x70CE34097DCC555DE63E83BE9829849F
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
0xAEADCBA8D78D99250896F9A8A3E6C1BD
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
0xA04EE5E4C1B7B5F2A4F4033B941B14B4
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
0xD881F7936D925F9F5B68239DBCCD7026
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
0x73DAE12C0C42C74C3FD0AB787020A1D5
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
0x7B27983033790345D7F4312AC9B3DBAE
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
0xBC40830B28D0BC54F17A86F531C72C5E
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
0xD7DC10FF0FA1E505EC6953764352021E
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
0xBE0DE2B1B2373926D0306A6B7B56292B
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
0xF87C0D1BEB4DAB540678039036FEBDBB
solution of the mystery?"
0x778452B9D36E32EEE7286AC0AF980C58

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
0x73ED4181946B9AD674CB6BE400F8BC0D
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
0x01603420273BC5B960C27A1CBE344C1E
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
0x6B4FC345FA15F0E607F90F2C40E89236
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
0x7FFE8402CB87693FB88BFB79CB2AA241

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
0xC7CFAF977DAB6BDA76EC4B718EF85669
candle.
0x0706C5350706C535BE12F52F1610318A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
0xC3761F5C39EE777C8155E1F2DEA94B86
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
0xD31DE706E8ECEC9C19AFEAAF00955AC5
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
0x310FC6E4DF4D63134E3870D7E299B741
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
0x4E93C610CDA1C2639E777364F9A530BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
0xA86EF86D4972246753FCA0AB6631397C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
0xD5FC63C5FF00FC30CC77D9929A6680F4
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
0x7FFAF29A8E45843484D7E1B909A7F3F9
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
0xE16ADDA801385E3B40C2170330472B92
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
0xB1BB17ECA7CC1F72A610A008E8CC3D16
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
0xDC3C0DF7A43A76A9322B8227BF8D0CEF
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
0xC57BAA2F796576C1CA3A2EE44A245BD8
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
0x14EE7E65E3F37BD0268E3EEC712099B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
0xA0EAAF090F74D8D1F1993B69D5F68DF9
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
0xAD1F03870367454845D90A8098A84F49
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
0x419BD34389936E07EA05C69FBF48A91B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
0xEFF511044A0D460FA7931CF3E3E649F6
Janet now?"
0xFF7FD99A1A8B9C3A98020D84A75F457E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
0x057932321856E83665295EABB140694A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
0x8D640988F6420C83C72BB749B9E59CFD
love and blissful union."
0x062C28F09C4A2CD874E73000AEED1DDA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
0x733DA7AE0941ACDA7B6BEF3C2E6382EF
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
0xB779BAE5F0C81331886DB94890F9FCBE
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
0x44EFAD54461C980F12133E3C94007254
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
0xF442C41485F08CD562CED37D52524FFD
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
0x3C69BF5EBC954909391CE6CDD4EC0DE8
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
0x854713C85EB986B0C1A45C9FF89D8EB3
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
0xD74A0A7AC9305F34589610A003DDF03D
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
0xF7E8F9A482672B380938D19B97811E43
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
0xDD2776308A5876B5DA00ECBD4FE13B12
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
0xC6D0F88BE6BA6F4ADBBA9C5A91A271E3
day.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
0xB9A7B3D5AE93C2DBF048A24663952711
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
0xB126EA35841AD4ED8E65E78999E3DDC0
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
0x7A6B2AB6FAEDA15FB9092935C94DE1E4
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
0x4EE502C686853715E85D900902141261
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
0x0F786850A92B407FBFFA7515FCE2F9D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
0x8235470B1AC061EB92C3FC9DD5FD6BA7
not taken one peep."
0xEF21A7821F6C7A5D9D945EAFFBF529D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
0xFFE895A8EFB34B9F973E3D3376BFD8C8
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
0xF4A691CD6F5638F578F2C1A1FB13C971
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
0x97A34EEC4B687F766D6237C8A3F7025B
by Mr. Rochester.
0x6909840E1CC5B80A95A719B1FB8E0EE9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
0x2170844A6D8CEE100539285AC9693A65
so long!"
0xE4A762FB314DD16DB59FEBB5D2DBB4E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
0x816840E952A2C99C9C05D4243EFBF86B
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
0x334712AECC7C530A6E981C8F6D65FCAC
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
0x7055F19A4B24B9E4ACDC5A2D7FD2ABDD
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
0x9A183CB99A5EE7F3F502907523855596

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
0x1BE105BDCEE09B76BC941EA334F40110
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
0x24B46041E54793D878B7F7327551E80E
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
0x64107E0662DC70429311404FD37C2403
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
0x638C664A471391FB306BE74F6E659AF5
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
0x31525C647037C29A7B73EA00C56D9727
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
0xF72886693369121FD305FF86BECA5B12
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
0x39FA5BDF6D1E47D80BE90A9B739D22DF
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
0xFA61A40370F1197846EE0C675B91CEF6
and flashing eyes.
0xBD3B06C1A9F83FDF1B737D7D1437C5A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
0xC0ABDB283C353145B0AAC5FA8D0544E4
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
0xDA5E9FBA19CAC2054CB2BE6AB2A7DF94
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
0xDBB754FB49BCEE036B938ADB0B1B7420
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
0x509D1A8CAD508B013A7328825509E870
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
0xD4A582B67FD124A86AC5B386ABE5E53D
seemed breasting and resisting.
0x37B8DA73ED48B66E0B72A544CB022907

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
0x064752971B5C6A8CFE970A93BAC68D02
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
0x1EBD342DA1B732B78C55FCBE104E4E31
me, Jane."
0x340615AB1B77807487EC26E7CF59E393

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
0x6C71812FCF049A23BBC99F81BCFD9C0F
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
0x2C8200F1874DA9B335AA0D8463DDC68F
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
0xE725950F9F4BCC45AF5770117DC56112
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
0xE829F425BC4B89ACD88C228721229B81
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
0x02CABD05E71048EEF639D44FAED2FAA6
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
0xA5FC40B7412D82EF47947F5975A96323
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
0xB1405799EA82981B80B3EC196D98D86C
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
0x9BA40AD25B5D506EB47FEB5BAFB9BAAF
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
0xBC38E80E4B00A53B5DBB1343465A8872
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
0xDEF796F4BBA44600CB44A5A60D8B59B8
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
0x78E066645AA80D550F5ECF2BB6661F03
path to the porch.
0x4376B0203B7CE53860808F0BFD158B92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
0xEB280654C211E91EE9543CEFB33880D9
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
0xB77E025C56ECAB1CAC1AF7B820869ACF
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
0x10635CD774F2FFDF15916E802EF19A26
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
0x6E4AE7993485606D53202A3D6230CCAB
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
0xD59A0FD1BCBA929B0495CCBBD7AE8452
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
0xB3ED605216865756596EADFC2D2917B9
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
0x35706D5B219AF0C85469A767B05CB733
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
0x28ECFB0F7761ED9E56CE880BBF1C6FE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
0x21B471771C759DF17B3E229404EC559A
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
0x5390ADD5738B8A3EC5436D117A92DD6C
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
0x6719A227DD94EBD5C4C3E9FD3F5017FB
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
0x047C814F7FBC7246DE8497B4767C79A6
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
0xA19CE71F0878A7B8DCED5B515E40CD9D
Rochester, went on.
0x7FA431EFF839DFCBA1EA9069E1FACF51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
0xD98AAFE37E041159CBCBCF3CDA7871EC
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
0x4AAEEA00EE6D71C9DE3871329F5ACA86
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
0x0C52EE7D3982C0960D5A17D90A08560E
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
0xF118E175B3FB6E78E9B24B6EDEB18FAC
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
0xC49D9EB4A3E59E213C3C8E403D682413
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
0x0923EE967C8A58D109829373176D4C61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
0xB6E1105ED09B407294A74CF647133320
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
0x37C4C5B8665039868DC5ACCDFA0DB520
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
0x16A3435514BFC0A6EF3DE2800E82A7AE
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
0x5ED53CF01838CF311089A5EB67DCD9B7
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
0x50E316216893BF537C8780C7A432EFDD
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
0xF65BD32643DEB26938B5CD39B014375C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
0x4257C5AF925FD40C738E6F19F222794C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
0x78C22C758387DB0087A01004E9B4E728
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
0xC6D0B40BFD3562F94564F8B120D28D2B
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
0x268CE434124FA3438F5D615A7DF8F16B
said, "Proceed."
0x51F6F56F2270631B3BAC06133E23627F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
0x1F60A7F43D54EF4BB7A63761F598FB84
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
0x0ED244E6B79D2AB17392B04D16B60C10

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
0xB1E42AD4DDAE89606F68F08D48834E48
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
0xFAD110604956E62BA6280CB8F75A02A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
0x7257A9ECDE1C3010D8F03F73F9C90744
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
0x0AE4F8BEAD88284C5874C3CEFA2A357B
marriage exists."
0x9E38322651E22157B66A91F20B9E43D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
0x0EA82F2638B4FA45AD9FC836B2B98305
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
0x44205981FE265110F9B35340E4F914F7
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
0x1E5E48081D96A19F24794D101E077E4D
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
0x82BC37CBC9EBF8B1349CA74EC7BEA546
beneath!
0x8F2A0CE4B01995E27FD908A411627269

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
0xDFA62B351ABCC9A3932043EA6DF25442
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
0x97BDEF9D38B0095AE1BAF0B8FB91DB19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
0x4961000C9E78838838CB3E85B214D0C4
advisedly."
0x26EC7384FB78DF47C400E974AC414A5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
0x07565729451A78C4CA5ECA51A6357148
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
0x8CD7AEF4ECD136B9524D44FDE499CB0A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
0xB6C55878C831D47A0006D377731544BA
Rochester has a wife now living."
0x1343C74887D175FBA6E6700829042901

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
0xBC9A8DC96175E15B8320B50B74986CFC
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
0xDF5780D0BB0F1107433219E1537A7DC1
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
0xEE7242608D0FFF81198A8713624F4342
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
0x0D756BBC3FFE290161F7A76E986A7DBA
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
0x5B54350962AB905099E789A693023949
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
0xCE0D460E35EF15EFBC2E253C023BBB37
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
0xFC63E1E44AEA21482B859211BBE9A0AE
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
0x6F3C33C720E7B6C28DA69E29DACE0227

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
0xF24EF353CF051412888F187AC53E6A01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
0xB1E12CAAF403D6123DB1B7EB3919176B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
0xE358E23BBEB4B849C3CA3CE0F7959A77

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
0x430671470A4B6E62BACFECA2BF404025
recognises, if you do not."
0x809A0DA14AF5501D1ECBA02ED7319A91

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her

place of abode."
0xD4414358F3401452B87D78470F181869

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
0xADBC41FD1799071CEC7BF50D23A69A4D
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
0x7DD0963C6AFB29FA79A75B460EBF9990

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
0x18EC938B2C02275E99E149412C40B54F
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
0x4716B9D6D90DE6A8521A1FB105DBDCD4
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
0x4685A6BC8836B1B08E70D38044D6A97D
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
0xE7405E1570DF74023041A201E6871014
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
0x7FBF66C5E572FE84C2E8173ECEF99D15
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
0x0E2861055F252DC3F44B7B15571247EA
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
0x76A4BA8B0868E05D109626B959E7538C
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
0x9B2C35D6B67817530BC1CA7950E80CA6
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
0xF647FACA4856F63AC1D0FA0A79CB1A11
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
0xFA8F38A25B983123C1E7CCAAC91DA1DD
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
0x1D0F5DE7C260D0C9367A95A1A5E7DCB4
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
0x12FF023BDA575C5455E67EC51FB61CC7
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
0x7A6DD51CFB9951C3C2C15FF441789580
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
0xAB8A0EEB73A50947E9A18B702817B797

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
0xCA22505E848099C21209F8BA22B9BBD3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
0x9F52BCCE31B48D4C4DCFF41FED9AC2D6
what have you to say?"
0x9E72FEEB64EB1ED51F4BBD9044F03328

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
0x84AF276359C1730434F03FD6CE924E11
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
0x57BE8FC679C105F471A621CF3D411E8D
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
0x1BE89F15AAF7ADC530DAEF0213B23F8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
0x46420FA55CC575F72DF81C64D184CE4D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
0xC9F42D7928C4F015856334CB1A9E5E8F
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
0xC4C3BF00021BDACD309B4B4652F61154

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
0x6D9A488C972D413B2B4DA86E9B0584CF
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
0x6A2A60361F461BC3E97D14721AB419D9
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
0x30FCB51D870758C9082B67BF4D742CF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
0x85682CA72954FDBB6732D0A5A791F44E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
0xE06844E46DA1580253A3F22DB1BB7D43
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
0xD9B518504C04D78E191B540818F8AEF3
formed his resolve, and announced it--
0x80988CFBB90E1FACA90BB303C410AEEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
0x6ECAB097D85CD412706EA669C49EC062
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
0xC9D2E70A98133F909E0447FFA9673E31
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
0xCB704FA23DC81CA4B76889717C9D448A
obeyed.
0x8738793D8738793D0A6EF45CBB32F683

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
0x5C0B1BA52A589907FFD1D66C15657F2E
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
0x182F92E59BBA5028C0E0B950FAEA6209
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
0x3DE32BFBC41D4555ECA1162853DB460A
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
0x198F68E6595B0CFB34A88F93814192D8
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
0xA9CAACE296772B7A9CA8E7AC4B213CF1
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
0x3BBE2EA5107F98595DF26BB946F98AEE
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
0x8CB50D6C662629FE47810270D717AF44
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
0x95E677093923295A9B5139BE6B8196BF
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
0x6649F68126CC102A2C53B4490B815FAD
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
0xA743C55AEB15AAC8F58D9753F7740A7F
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
0x90CC2E3FD2F4E75495996B199B4DE011
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
0x28F30B362B2598A2DE4814C49EF58CD0
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
0xE821171B6E17013770BA936352FAD098
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
0x8E32F394AF84D1E4BCCF77DB03E8A10C
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
0x65260C7D3333B506781ED092388722B6
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
0x51CC7273E8021BA8DBF21B015C364141
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
0xA291FBCE37F4A319831E5D9906056159
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
0x792AB6FE16682DEA060C11D9D5B364C3
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
0xBAD9D6045D63F446F92639F34A97BF08
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
0x286F66EA5EE9345A94314F02F1B342B1
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
0x953C8C0491CF33A6533FFEADA2509DE9
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
0x0E7A4211BFCDDA76612DD54CAB64720B
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
0x611E02A9D9185CA1EAB0D43A603F098B
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
0xA9E64E05B113F30F8DA7252E3C161F80
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
0xBB1F483558BD38681265934AA38A64E1
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
0xCB6813D5085974266B7888E4236397C0
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
0xAA0F46C32F6A527128D6D19CCE102DB5
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
0x4B69705265EF8AB3AA04AFD548E0A2DC
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
0x14902FA5FA2BC528E11A4930E0D1A4A4
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
0x0B0D8F7AB9985FAF21636AEC80BFE5E9
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
0xB6BBD2FE2510169CC0C55F371AEB142D
you--follow!"
0x567F5594175021B6E6733AA9837C931B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
0x7CCCB7BB06986700C41846AFCAA95D75
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
0x30C309D36637C9377E2304A0F3A1B658

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
0x8ED5AD783DB5216AC5D923DF1A83B199
will not be wanted to-day."
0x3419E03FE01B15215120319E8C453F04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
0xEEEE7C241342243B9F650768AE111F80
greet us.
0x977BC3A33FC1248E9AF23105512A1DB4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
0x5C24E6B368131D753F2AE2EC83F52FC3
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
0x435B5AE7166A2BE8A34D78EC03713EFF
late!"
0x38C092E238C092E2DD3B7AE90EDAA67E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
0xA135C5AAF5027C8EF914130D30A8678A
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
0x1E673687AD0C26A13B1413C29DA05153
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
0x83AE3BAF36EB05F105CD69DC22C56C08
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
0x658A5E91BEF11704D3BC25FD1FBDE748
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
0x2281F42754F4BF85964EE9C8CBEED4AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
0x8101C69C281B06605589B2E3EC12C380
here."
0x4EF79AF14EF79AF10AA79BB253237783

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
0xD5BC51B0E30CED0556F6E892E50FAAC8
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
0xED6274F9999D3C921C9DE81A6F9BD26B
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
0x77DD0A4A14E6C4776C5D39A6DF4EC0C1
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
0x61B3B3E8DBCDF89C88EF45E42FECA9DA
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
0xD44658E53E05FC273399DC04034DDA8C
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
0x0F3CFE9FB68D34EA7F7915312B10EA40
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
0xFF6E14D1455F84E365E5CE5C575FCB8C
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
0x591A8DD180E126CE38F6F54590B44399
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
0x7646FE4DED0E07492441E06A2ED0295A
mane, hid its head and face.
0x4DC47A538109883588FA32AB3C2709E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
0xF4F80AC0CDFF99AC998AFBDA983B26F4
your charge to-day?"
0xFE9787BE63C9C26F8D55F68F8EB111CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
0x415CE81DE938D86DFB7533819BBDBA46
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
0x0F0F023F3E1D3DE8248DB279429AE096

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
0xAE5EAFC01CC90926B782A7C75789A63C
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
0x85D34B375B30F7595BB9A0F3CBD236DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
0x39C67B9267631FD4993D132A0E1880F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
0x173E71D7D14B454919C983F8FAB4B38F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
0x754896CFA9A9BF25273C175CEE0ECAEF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
0x0F94BCCB6EF9BEEB01C9671C27A48DED
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
0x70975B6A05F162FEDDC5F3F85BBA624D
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
0x2D99F2A44A077668BEE77D5F38AE4E89

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
0x0C6796F4AA4DE09029D4B40E48275806
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
0x9B5F330A8E4DCEAE7528395020AF1512

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
0x7DB4A43869AFB74D4FE245B6EC8ED147
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
0xC993ED29BCFF591C93E61ED5EE1F6E6D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
0x9D8272F947FB0523594C2E91CEA7B6C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
0x30561BFA7E062D494E7CBD6944309246

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
0x214580802A03168997B7691802BC5E2A
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
0x079CFDABE619DF1E93AFEBB030F4011F
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
0x7846E8D5ED6B8581A740B754A99D87F3
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
0xA330377C49720FE69B025BC29CFAF518
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
0xE58ED5BEAFDF720CC85DF2A01BE9310A
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
0x83FE8AAF282CDC390643AC16542008E1
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
0xA8BEB9BC4BD5515C960ECF19B5383082
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
0xAA99E75ACF42A52403DC1C9682213F26
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
0x471FD70C0CC8F91AB25A743CFAA18240
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
0xBDE59F2E9E7DDD2402337EFA91FFC2FC
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
0x686F0B4D259D662AEAF888B5EE173654
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
0xE56FC6AE0447F7A265E313426219363E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
0x04D9A3340257EECB3983D37FD7404ED7
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
0xF1C3DAD02C0653441D2062A88B02AD11
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
0x2A9939AD8CD0B40A76F1E03916478169
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
0xEAC12170590CA3FD40A55DE6E693938D
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
0xB84E873C162E630537A6442ECAF64567
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
0xC61ED39645664265F3B12AB9630C7EA7
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
0x2E492AD9BB1AAA3CF4516C5FA980C69F
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
0x476DCE4B2C21F401D0AEAF8488EDD6B2
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
0x512508899446411DC9363905969D8AF9
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
0xE59E60495CB921583D71D7C7DD4DB938

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
0x0F52864D40DBB5DBB3AA394A194F49C4
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
0x3046AB81D8E10BBC3E55066FC160AF56
the stair.
0x4D4E0C5425A050049B450C22AC6477D4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
0x389EE193620D5F6CF534869C53F1DB66
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
0x0218D5BA0E963DA4BD93CA03E54EA003
returns to Madeira."
0xFF2BEDE157044834EC9AD24E7B8E8038

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
0x98E7D907800EC75B54DD5797B670FEBC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
0xFAE6F5F43C34FD3FB770FFEB3A97F5B7
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
0x44DDB379C5E0C14A2FFE472EA23DF5CF
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
0x0FF93C48E375421474AC166303803062
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
0x75F25B807202869CFF77DF641CDC98CE
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
0x08C793F332A9FE70B031EB39515B048D
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
0x829F8D14F15D3843A167535A7C6014DA
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
0xCCC5E8352D2673BD776661275AA21A9F
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
0xB513ED81E1297A1EB61524E45FE2B340
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
0xC0B0437171F554DD6B60FCD138913B1B
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
0xAF3AF70D5FCA3BABE80EE32EF88624FB
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
0x61170763FC98755D6054F64E6E6F5593
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
0x87F55E2512CF9BC052652E9507F55A62
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
0x59331D5C4813D31D86BDA5EACE656617
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
0x27FB2DE5E2609755B029928A918A164A
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
0x8E678147E57BDD1083513565EAB2B004
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
0x359BE17CED88224DFB51B614F1381CAA
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
0x81F5833DAD5E45EE4BC56C89EA2D09AC
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
0xB2788CA020F77B7ECC701D8748C1279B
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
0xA6F4D2DCEE4B7BD4B44F944F9AD736AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
0xF02CC32774F4C37B1BEA236AD5C72140
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
0x381E3B8A97BE3EB00C16422FF540C049
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
0x4EC3CB3BA836E2E350ADC737C687740A
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
0x60C443CDF8DF1E7396A0D42A70FA5024

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
0x097A1064C1DEEAC0CABCADBB4AC3AC2D
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
0x8C483A76BCED80B7BE842B0187D49D7E
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
0xBAD136546318CD86AA9F1F67DF9AE87C
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
0x319690F723B3287AF55881912A652CB9
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
0x83FFFAE975F3AB23D5DD19E9BAD2B196
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
0x66A83B91988AE5F584D030CBC12E2D40
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
0x683EDE73F981E54158C6CE4A5F41432B
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
0xD86E85AA3F6DAB61458DFEF08E6DC379
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
0xACCD0D854DB6EA9247DBDE85BD3BD99C
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
0xF45173A825D45E15F981CA5E5495F470

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
0xEAEAFA2A91BF6868B547ECC1FE0EE76C
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
0x8458B90ADE6A63FAF01CB0BA470D83F9
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
0xF9B9A73E2BA5B20480A07A2406B745FC
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
0x2A65EA2BD6E029A75E94FCC4BF1E2729
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
0x90E8C85D21BCB6BCDE2FDB75B6C71E24
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
0xD721DE1A6BDA97359838444E58F09491
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
0x8DD521290F813C9A9311AC48D05A7391
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
0x27FBE3A37FD60DD61C0F1A11DD8BCFA3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
0xA7129FEB3AFD444853199B281A124D31
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
0xA6C458D36337CAE2AAFFBBF6A65AB3E7
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
0xF61B1746CB99EFFBE17173DCDD57BA0E
prospects?
0x3DA2EC9B3D67FFE62AE15AC6E4C9489B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
0x18741AA45A75F1351D1C9548646F50CD
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
0x3059555DA2E41DA38765323A38C1D66B
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
0xB7283D1D3A8D328D0FCA22E05F46A077
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
0xA4A94C23DBB83A8163BAB0590B605060
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
0x2722D8F4C67FD10410B204B66EE272F4
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
0x13B823FA25BE6FD0D50453EBE0343749
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
0xD6D4C5AB051F2E9807BFCF84FE9E84F2
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
0xACA661E56FD40D752BFC5858BD06AC41
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
0x26B827D736D04D26BE9F3E315C64739E
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
0xA3B7313D7633FC8466C3AA64AC718122
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
0x44FA81F0FC826438CFC6529A18713ABA
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
0x7F6CDDEEFF8B1E93BA4327FD7B0F6E68
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
0xB2129DA96C91A345CA22D0E4E294AA64
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
0x2539C9C9BD2889463E4359B7C6414E37
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
0x2AA14963799C6255A0B551929447FD4A
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
0xED8EBA0C071E3EFB3687132B7CB71CD5
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
0x3CAA143D6C424A4E3991A39BC93C5130
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
0xADE67F5BE41516BA81CB1E05454283F3
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
0x4B0BD5C6CFD62365A15D65276C7E963B
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
0xE56CE8389891C989FA142C0FD9EDBD5C
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
0x122F0CAFA876471C3D7F0C368B42FBBE
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
0x052FE672DB418298B4978D83423C2ACD
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
0x2D25151767C24FCB89EABEFE1FD9D932
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
0xAF2FF09BE6E86E8FB60356B6C8687FB4
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
0x2E2FE24CAE4ABC6EE9CD1311862FDFBB
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
0xC13B7D5FD639D8E1AE2826B8728C47CE
conduct!
0xC9F4098C0C81157D1B9F6E482D36F8A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
0x113969793B7D3B80DB535817EC040870
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
0x169D59A821F1ECA3B3F9AE6B02D6A4F5
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
0x7AC12A19B87CAF4A652788CA1ABA12C2
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
0xE66956C277CC04FDD323D8DBFED7137D
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
0x350B32D81DA097B9724A829D8E24FCF6
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
0xBED61FAB0D2FEFC6CA246DDDA79FB14F
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
0x2CEFC69D5DFC64D0A73BE68E607EEB7D
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
0x8971360B13A5A1D3FFA594F76336E849
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
0x1036FF7778448D3D9D4B988AE63CA0FE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
0x835A3F98F8DA7972FDA22E7613074AEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
0x58DED43285302EE01C78B81B19E847A5
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
0x4B78B35C9E2D42B065CBA7167BF798DA
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
0x3C743D6E481B3115E957C02C9D3C9D32
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
0xB16A4B456BC9A36370D1603F620E3201
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
0xD17F736E621B051A13EE791601BBD630
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
0x18BF484B7E938A04F7A79B4CBA1A2E6D
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
0x6353D3275AD72D911BEEDCF273696413
floods overflowed me."

CHAPTER XXVII
0x473AED4C491FE3002E0E07574BFF3C1D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
0x6C0A6A72D19FF2F891642E83C7261E2F
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
0x45A1FD4371A1C44B55331B5AABC1949F
"What am I to do?"
0x5A6F6F3BEF5BD439B62120863B75697A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
0xC1ED026B3E020A3F1E6CCB7C6B20B408
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
0x66F452D08FA45439E12FC80AE9B2FC49
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
0xA7CEF121FBBE1CE02E2C567FC22E7F20
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
0x49E68BC39DA05771739A3934DAB5ECB7
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
0xF58BB309CD388C3AFBD62D2A293050CA
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
0xCA6A40F0DE68FB13AE2D5503723692E5
cannot do it."
0xB4416041122274AB18D9F27F663AEE32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
0xCB6DCF55568F4A92D345BF409D5803C0
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
0x064FC64F3E823CD605EDD353E0E3034D
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
0xA24EF748D5A1099608E7B29C53AA26CC
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
0xCB04DAE0E2F9DAB23D1C2490286369D1
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
0x963ADCF39CFE7DBB67D3364D6741B1C7
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
0x7BC01950657EAEA81EB44DF7960BB991
depths of agony.
0x2E720CA58B99433980CB5DB7E17815E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
0x023BD495C606C2709A41C6B41513D6BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
0xCD863C10E14218B753F2F230CCB9FE28
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
0x369093C8498CE3D4287B0EFED2DB5C0B
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
0xBFCFBFE4386BCEC44451EF2510A4DAA7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
0xFED057186568EBF9694514572FDE3163
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
0x695E0BAC14C10820DBBEBB0177C1CDD2
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
0x08922C7797C2DB055BD099699ECC4107
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
0x8EB9D1322C7478DFC293B874EE77A8D5
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
0x4AC3D49D4EDFC40A6666E6940A4A6591
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
0x95DB3E1F2DA6F5E975B85F8E73E215D0
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
0xCF5A9AF5D612E58BB7C74A4CA7E7BD88
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
0x8FC7C261ECC794CACD269A1D90BB91E8
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
0xAA2FC6138801A58B7EFBEA044E2E466E
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
0x6391207DEB7D3AC7596C2D29A34CB28D
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
0x6F3161A9B1BED054454391C175794EF8
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
0xE6EC34B921D94A07DB09260F8E0CD0AE
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
0xFB3997DC2B11B577E3BC9CBCA82FB4E2
threshold.
0x3AFD5C57079020A40CC82546253D092E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
0x9232C47D24267234D6F8338B6F255821
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
0x8E9B69E7E40B3E9B9BBDAC6FD76EA4B7
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
0xF6DA946B22951CD1AE174C42803853EB
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
0x01E4FCDF9A68934C38F0B067192D7F36
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
0x588471E1219C1A00EAD1B6E61CF4985A
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
0x257ADA57E3CABF46A10063EC63570998
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
0x99D7FACF7F9DB1A10F7818BEE2D4CD6B
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
0x75E4FF185671C325FD6918E8BB15A597
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
0x1E6A6B2CC9021130606660CE841FA82D
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
0x56D158D263194C77281E324204682A9D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
0x2B9630702267F21CDF9EF3CA087E3D87
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
0xA02FD0260EFE1CD833372506869FE8BF
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
0xA6DEF83D1C75C3BBED16BEE11C3E7959

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
0x17D1EF55B773051A449E9C5D6D63E999
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
0x55EAFC9FB7B754155AC936CF57668444
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
0x737D0470C61C187DE4016B3C56AFB48C
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
0xCFDD03A9006C637DD8C433A68745B7EA
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
0x0C869CAE634BE88ED03946DCBBC11974

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
0x3BBDB9F2E882A61089F3E425004C0122
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
0x374E5FC916F5F1442F3CFD9C18D96A74
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
0x101130A393239E18D67154A654A5B4E0
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
0x69D66A6057429F85A7AD23F9CF389D4C
heart's core.
0x6DDC2DEE1D6711C9D858D75799217C2B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
0x6EAD87B5FD450E50A02ACB50FACB693B
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
0x9E5F34BE77027B20CB83B0B3050BCA00
the result rather of weakness than of will.
0xAB492A642D3FA81988932FABB2955ACD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir."
0x819DC436D909DC2575D71AB904FF91C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
0xA40B80F56A1CA7C3A51F36DF98BAE54E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
0xD8DB0DA4279ED1609588A3FDE11E06D0
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
0x40384EF5A4532A7AF703D1EBBC6E4F38
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
0xE0AAB32FFAA5B4F87AAEBD67B3FE536C
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
0x5636737B0C47B73E4BC83F2E17C4347E
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
0x4770DD267DB7829F921C33ACED4B86D6
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
0x791B20D96336FE16CB41B33B354A2B58
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
0x15F9B15A12009B6DC6F12EAD975A3C07
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
0x62C016660032E6E5310BD7E6F93449EB
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
0x9E8DAEB4E6DB52EF86A0BBC160F37FB0
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
0xBE682461A4D43D0CF5A4288B847E5762
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
0xE44C7149C9973F4ED2C9B9DCE5B46B61
him."
0x633FEE44633FEE4486E8D0CF0A1A0996

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How are you now, Jane?"
0x1AB2031B00060701D96664A102409DEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
0x36E47A42E06E19807D736B3AFF91817F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
0x575EC18CFA99B084E587658DC5CA4475

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
0xB7EFEFCA066FBA88CD051F2C739D6FB1
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
0xD12900AC72945AA29D6A1F9FABF75CFB
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
0xEAF2D9021A03A82BEE81EAD58C0D7725
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
0x671D2B89DE837C0B02CD15D5BBF510CC
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
0xC8A3A55CC86F4AF63101CC7A05149C4F
put his aside.
0x0A9CACD9ED4F5CE62169C809AB65675B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
0x954B8C3FE362B963C1A67076088B61EC
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
0xBB0649AC5728E1CB2F4C2CD1902BD907
appropriated?"
0x6948E3EE1573A94B14AE3D957559F0E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
0xB045DA0B43F4E87BE1D04274A02C353E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
0xD05A16A5D8476907C41E8E2639FA14AC
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
0x174693B50402F5D4D7921FA082AA5E70
rightly?"
0x2825E6F8AA0DB4A6FBF31B0FB3187F29

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
0xF104378EC0E6A118CA545654EB2721CA
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
0x7B86CC276FA8354F341CE1C598F2BA77
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
0xA543533FA964275DE3686A51CA160BE7
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
0x92C82466671C14CEA8BDDD0A2A0CE1D0
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
0xFC28BA6630DDFF8E2CC64CAE98D8B60D
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
0x7F91FCB1FC1BF91B12575CD7F70CE41D
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
0xB4FED7BDF91FAACC74B0ADF868DACAE2
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
0x5A92D086C4BB0A6BB593668703A33348
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
0xA358A52AAD24ABD0FCA49F2183C91067
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
0x892EE4C36BEFD5F26134054C78CDF852
know you--I am on my guard."
0xE9722CE6FE1989B6EB79E7CADC9C3977

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
0x25DB9D84BF2E1BA5D2B874EA06913151
warned me to curtail my sentence.
0xEE4F3FF859E0B3B412C7F4346D69890E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
0x5D2F2676B082B8F4F63E2CE7A5579EB6
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
0xEB0AAD9B1D2F273E6FCF652589593645
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
0xF030F2D237946476A3ADA7AB0FA94DC0
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
0x2511C7E2CB588584ACF2E84053A41A89
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
0x1D3B0865F2259A5F4006345C8090726E
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
0xBB5F6D4E672A956F1E2AD8909B8B89FA
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
0x5E12CD5AE9BBC19C0C94DA39B2279818
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
0xE36551D19EEA89C9351F4A172C2547F4
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
0x0E852E67A2EA8526EB2D35725CB2A343
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
0x21504FE687C25D4D30604F7D00815EBA
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
0x10A9455DD46FC449440B33CB47F95B93

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
0x46800972C2F5AB68981336F74F239995
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
0xBFFE44D02C936B4422B07BF9FDE4A1D1
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
0x1A622A3BB4F222819E55A0AE3DBFFF87
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
0x0323FA5D8735D307FDCC95B4CB4BE9CA
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
0x2DDB5C65B65C48F41617BC075746FE57
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
0x82639D8D1A1DCB3864BE6BEBB4834D7E
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
0xF99974F6A91E79F83F20A2BF7559FF8B
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
0x87A581F800D70EE020A69F81F2D3D5CE
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
0xCACA0B4C9F92C7D3853D57CB64C890CD
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
0x11BA95AE545C564E81973C9FD621545F
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
0x081DED8C2244D1D2D71914D3D56495A4
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
0x42DE7AA00A1AA3455978B5D631A42BF9
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
0xDCFA09BEFFA6A757F7356F65B3921671
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
0x07D09C3E06013F5A05160E854ECF537A
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
0x39E0A009347D26667E9D6AB80A7042D2
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
0xAF1A0F8F6557AF5DC66B98EA3AF16ABB
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
0x52DA79118DB0B51BF3D23B7F86D48B1F
assassination, even of what I most hate.

"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
0xF5FF92A03080E0C98D5061E630AF057D
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
0x3DFB852D9E3E310494EB2D9DE2621A1B
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
0x8CE6D0344FAB5BE4C7A9EDA67F7A69E3
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
0xE285C76492FF81FCA651E6CD37707F4D
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
0xECEC796C8D4E881E36367F5E306C1F55
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
0x4536721CC5CC6E861490491C2ED8B79E
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
0xD40A54CB7F2FDDB41889712D490FA7B3
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
0x6D4C2CC260CCC870DDE70A7DC8A4DA4B
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
0x4858963F9616F778DA9D23981CF4E47F
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
0xCF9BF30DBB62204CF206C9E1AD43E670
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
0xE5AAA7AC9D1C0511962064524FF05FC9
cannot help being mad."

"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
0x7AD88A5DDFC358CDD9D7FE709A876B9D
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
0xEBCB06D9A4CA910C3E8ECCBDE515D744
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
0xA8EF1BA9018EA03D485629305B4C22DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
0x81D485D9692D307E19057500ED1C486F
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
0x541CEBF1276E0AC3173B901BE84B17D9
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
0x37533EF0D0E56E9B9FFB465AE25CD773
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
0x6FF57ED8F349967CE5E5D004FDAA26DA
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
0x095FF709B98891D8788000F29BF0B353
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
0x90470A8EE0C4B358EF9B9C5B8406ADD1
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
0xD7EC48650212C43557F27AAC96B33302
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
0xFF21EC81C23F47A646DC29146837D162
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
0x175E9387E0B0CC935B05C2249ECB23A8
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
0x6B4D7D62BD89A741593E2013812F1033
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
0x3AD3AA9B72FBFC4576EDEC734566BEB6
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
0x68E6C6FA2FB4F91CDEFEDC2EC70647EF
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
0x3673C57C5AAA5658356E6E1BB38DB3F9
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
0x3BA409BA07F0ED1A1DF411C786DFF57C
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
0x76507F9E4AB040F903DE4AB358F210D3
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
0x22C6A0249D6D67DC95542DD3BB1C30DA
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
0x4694F52E8F0C873BD62D11D604CBF3F3
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
0x41CE0EAD856E6877DE4D9E88032FCB6A
falsehood and slander."

"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion

for you."
0xCD72A814ED4A4B2021C607164A68952E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
0x12B8376926026135E81B520F635BFB0E
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
0x65ACAD764499D313B6BEED5C7052798A
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
0xBB56BDF0F77B1FAD28992A41E282433E
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
0x6A712A2D37853FC357B24EC580F1541C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
0x8BD3F7F992A34517354320F056296D3C
too dull for you."
0x2F522FFF2450A118E783B3A0E0D97710

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
0x49E8093DEA65A87DFCF1556DEABB1D33
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
0x42690E3A3DB4272A37DA5CD625F076B8
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
0xB894FFFCA2D8A7595CD2D4892DC482F1
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
0xD7EB486D60392753D8725C92E90E9FD6
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
0x87220DCF92A4AE5EB9C840A9F7492CCC
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
0xD0086D95CB1D68725B3CED9451947105
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
0xBEDBCB589AD64757389CB6EF21155594

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
0x62120980BDA4C427F82025DECB5C2165
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
0x97AFD0F661C68DC6928B3E11CDF02851
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
0x457FDD8A3C4E8A0375D8441676125A8D
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
0xBC7A726083A8FD0624E03582E11E615B
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
0x0AAE080FFCA1D94BE52E5E08642A3DEA
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
0x49596E170BAD1CFE7A3E0799936B3782

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
0x679B85A8D32657F20E03AB5869852331
before me.

"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
0xDC5352EF51148A6013B253C41601766D
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
0x6663321DCF15686BB9E6F6F661960BAA
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
0x18DE75DE2C4969F5C4A244ACFA69DFA4
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
0xE274987160A90416EEBA1F81DE525D3D
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
0x3B924238F06BCF5ABD2E169959535F0D
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
0x34703C99CC06D7349D66B0808937FAB1
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
0xB9C35B3B2BB6441C145E1BBD88AF8BC4
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
0xB7D82AC315058A934EE513A5D2526FC1
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
0x17D55E99F9031C4D9405011C85010609
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
0x6CC09411A49F7A55F833154A6D8DA7A5
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
0x8DDCBE98B4246C5214817EFE40FAC681
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
0x19E65BE4472A01AD7C7BC244248D628F
soothingly--
0x138480ED4273425275284311D4D24EAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
0x5AC60BC5647A0382B6715CC2B1F0D810
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
0x455A74EECF55DFD470342D974F588BD3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
0xFE044F566624043AF9E1C2191289E7D4
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
0x68AE93A172EA298C40EA6BB21585FE7B
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
0x8090F17629FC404314D7834C1C2AD45A
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
0x39903306503B5C94C4395B5AC071523C
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
0xF367779B272F8F9A9DB7815DB476CEF1
heartily.
0x59B0C073D2B855763F0EC480FC976503

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
0x20BFA5E48C1BA4388A0F590A41DC199F
not while he was in such a passion.
0xFC9D750D4BEA335A9197BAFB01EE09BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
0x2AA1A82DFBAEB33C17CC6A2A431E6E33
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
0x23709A64FB4DFE17A6EC5D68F5CD7E99
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
0x362E1EE9B89E323248E42A84EABF9A6F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
0x7C7D24235CA76D691CEF4C918A0FC04D
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
0xC46E4155BB65B0110FFCE7FA8661C611
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
0x95C9903F2A94EF7E24125A898826C908

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
0xA389A5B89DB384DEECBB691680994EE9
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
0x4EFBCEA973F196B4B5CE56818DC784C1
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
0xBEE7A283D7B3BFA5F76032749A7A5C78
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
0x4E3BD030189EB0D9C9F551600FF41E93
were some toad or ape."
0x88B8719141C9E438372D7054838A76D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
0x99286B4710A7CDCE9350CFA5D356BD33
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
0x02D27518205E52EBA86A48540481228C
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
0xE0C1EFA230DC1BBFDCEB2E0786BD1F5C
where I had wounded.
0x5DCDB201BD8B21E614FCE1A96FAF5BC0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
0x0FF27D2C7F0981FA097457388B422C91
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
0xB2F765B62B46692D9ABEDB6FE1405667

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
0x1888FEE0FA2E3A19D3D877F638EEF7FC
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
0xC5C4BD67EFCFBDB7F3B270BF7967A627

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
0xDF103903F026FC39E9238E483D408C50
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
0xD30D69660DBD91BF71A7AFCE7D422117

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
0xF7FE6FE9AD2FFA222A745C1E5E483D1C
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole

life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
0x3C8BCDF053A52CCA62D64507AE79B936
scenes."
0x98E93F89D08F8A95A9E788B38BC95A9F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
0x064AAB11F51DCBE2BEBB7E6A9A9DCC3D
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
0xB2613DA3D5366026779EE8248BDE0631
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
0xF725DDE674C6D4B3A69A65371ADFB8BF
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
0x33F48C2B4488D5F7EA68A2FF373D8084
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
0x6588CD9F7E57B700EE82C0AE8B25D8C9
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
0x0978680718372C10D1FB382B939829C3
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
0x5516379CB4711FF5D7C986BCCDEC3129
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
0x214E90327328B5B6D298CB9980CBFA25
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
0x67FD94BB227179FF86603E2A5861D15F
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
0xCC3E78778D0E566AE7EDD4622DADD9F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
0x8A8607BCB401F5E726C3DFCF443E787B
still I dared to speak.
0x79FEAA575A91A40CB5907C598F92AC30

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
0x45A059BF6F8064AC35981AA6530B0266
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
0x5304952EA4AFA47BB16AA87833C5C75D
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
0x8DF1FB592F054629133670661D0C3C44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
0xF161C0ABAB137299F6D3C1E5EAF2FF84
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
0xEC1249B06C8843094D50955352817065
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
0x0338AC6225D23007F5AA61943CF1EC98

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
0x565DC62DB44BAFA64D06096254657176
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
0x2A14C970D3EB99E0AD857ED1ED69E316
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
0xF42963A5CE049DDD497A2D1ED197F615
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
0x067AFD371B37A06C464D9A8FE65B64A2
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
0x667EAB352FD5BACE9F6A2FC3711E9F97
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
0xC35BFC1767E9CEC0165F1D8BC46E0925

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
0x692F4BC4027A52E6CBB18F1EE2CB2BD8
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
0x3E3C61ECBAB5F7DD2EB18366C8B81B6A
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
0xBF63678AC270135BCBB5C131B2586EB2
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
0x85A0B301A3ACC4ED323D2D861208DE68
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
0x4C914DB1563CA2A9A3414BF5E8C12637
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
0x9690272A1A877EE2133ED560909DDA2F
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
0x265BEAEAF918D692A75A7890E460436C
case.  Can you listen to me?"
0xBF3E724A82AC57C01A6BB4E8F3CBFD25

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
0x731672860947E6A354B90259AD55BD25
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
0xD5122064011CF279968FDC8DF6B7CC62

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
0x9E694A73E306E78E891529C8ACF40B1D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
0xDB4E91F32534AAD1FC511328352A104A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have understood something to that effect."
0x7B198624EF60CABA8686A227BDB97EE7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
0x4D6DD862C1DB4E04A429A74318C5FE0B
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
0x8D057120B1CD38A2229AF4057642D026
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
0xB73CA9B492E554846E3E74A972A0E475
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
0x1684D022000E09F70D1B21706FC9DFAF
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
0xB0159DB093E3F9BC8A20C0C476BE24D5
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
0x5726743AE5B281D21F71ED4A9A4B1A1C
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
0xCC69301DE3792B6721BF7BEB28E16E75
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
0x7D3C28F0758C250C149399825987E7DD
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
0x728DCFF1C55A6E294EECA9D0CFB965CF
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
0xC9C25268840737DC19432123E3B71B69
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
0x236CEB6C410E1033F29ED37E380D5A01
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
0xD7ADD59F7A83BD416E8164CA520D4E34
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
0x601D40D854192AD71A292C78FFCBF2B7
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
0x3CFCC786A278781B0E0A24C58923D926
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
0xA25DECAD0A906678ED6EAA8C8C9C7ACD
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
0xD36272FA0F859495952D49D5615A43B5
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
0x21A4EABA7074E287F1AFE99BF4637414
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
0x99EBCE58F3405AF65B28E185D897E320
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
0x8460E7D99228C99DD4B9B65DAC0408AB
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
0x5A512A2EBB21490C5687449627A07F10
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
0x9413A3812BFE58D1A03FFA0A40143CC7
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
0x770092F41361A7AFFEB8919676C06ABD
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
0xFD07CE3828EBC7D5733F16E118E81E87
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
0x8C72025CB980EA126FCACB6F95ABE7E4
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
0x494B3D9B5CF1AF0B3BA06D49EBEFC9EC
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
0xA7678BE1278466EBBB43D8DD7DAC2783
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
0xC2AC1A6799778A5331EA45AC8757C78D
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
0x48A781121995438959163000F1EA2DAD
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
0xAEFDE73946D9CC16394BC8EC103D1DE9
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
0xCAC48434D96E8AF4B7AC42A8B3A4AB35
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
0x9E30C288C656FFD47B17DCD1D2BECED1
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
0x2AD85E691105064B30694A627A964E66
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
0xB095196D3EE545B5789B4560B2464D22
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
0xE56AC6E3D1D27D54D6391E91720D0673
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
0x6E33AD0F2AADBA3BA118E06347A520DB
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble

mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
0xB3DE164E4D870BB6584C71715C864B85
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
0xF2B369692A783D61C3A3AFEA74BD08B6
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
0x9DA0750FA1A74BC17F9CA237F986CCC0
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
0x6577D2ADC1816A22119820D5DFCDE043
plot against me."

"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
0x31F207BD8E68F817BCB2F56633759388
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
0x8EE05A7AB819EC14F92C28F8482198C3
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
0xFB7F3F09C2149E01DC9275895EE68677
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of

being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found

that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day

with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
0x34923F9B24E4807A66B0FCC275EAAE4A
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from

perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
0x162CD3A871F06DEEA676FD14BCEA498A
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
0x12FAF16A92B1E567E0BD2B71BA265E70
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
0x07867DF322328F40C4CA6B7D7278CD6C
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
0x1DA2B33EB7AAFD920EDF03E54CA40004
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
0x00EE863EFE4F0AFF5384F6914932E20F
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.

"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
0x0ED9C904E4777E72C938AF1B4E1B82BD
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
0xE2C8A94B23FE4E6046DA2D62139E85C8
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
0x91513FAAB332070999152B1960975BED
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
0xE5C4520DCA2D3872CE96BD0C52660EB5
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
0x1EEBD466E9D4436C7C2752B8BD64FE8B
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
0x642200E6FC34E3722EB9038310E80545
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
0xF8902B15038D67B3B275D192A7482102
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
0x5C0FCD551878D4796D266B7A0A008936
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
0x9FE345CF22E0B0320A6AD424166A0A56
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.

father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
0xF2925F3365E86ED04F96960025E3D485
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
0x43443DDFB69704F943A20B7BF64E64A5
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
0x9DFF52F2C4F8222F72AFF1D3CEB38280
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
0x43D90F693C184BFFFB41F45F740BF804
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
0x41D0529893AFBFFDCE0F88FB07BDFE3A
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost

sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"

which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
0xC4AFCB00FA8D66D46C60A91941239919
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
0xBE361E77D685B63574CDFBFB895106EA
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
0x595ED7E442280DFB2EC3D970EDBE1D6A
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
0xA32ABC0E6C9DE05339BEF3829F384A61
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this

moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
0xFF22234F8A9C5204055E9CED9F713785
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
0x516FDD4D8CB92317049C0ED772347892
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
0x75EDE58318F5EC9598D10C20244D1137
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
0x9C74551B8CC9E2D39C2B01CBD44CF2CF
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."

"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
0xE1F50D91E63FAF26F8B536D129EEBDFC
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
0xD7536F19D264F93600F90B392362D9A0
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
0x23E5C206602CD6B6A6410FFDD41C10E6
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
0x637DBA6292DC5988A982FEC80A477F76
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
0x6172EB99A76CE33C1F5304CCD934E16F
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
0x31D2D17E84750FD4B0EEA59D6C768BDF
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
0xFA04A5B82AEEB54584669C2473236330
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
0x588BA3ABCB3040577B4C67F64E77F22A
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
0x5FE874F8D1DCA244C6341814E08C265F
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
0xE28CB75BDE75948784BC25AFF590CED0
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
0xB0B9D33B53F182AED274FE608F08F58B
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
0x2EF301C94C0DC02368C302D322B17C46
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
0x323A829B2F2024EEAA33A74CA60B0B95
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
0x77FEE113A84C61A6DA14C24DF9592253
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
0x064F2780B583235F969FD066937D365D
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
0x5F4289E3A82EF53626B5771663304326
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
0xD3CEB8BFA73E375696A39C7527A20592
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
0x9900382E2F0BA0966766D2A3637110B6
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
0xC383FA85C37DBDAFE12A93D694EDA8B1
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
0xF54C31AFCF2E7F4C589B4A76EA4AFC51
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
0xAB7DAF043206BCAF06D4EDE3CDE8D353
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
0xFD90F5FA319B6ED5ED638208596B78BE
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
0x3AB3464D58F693F96D1CCDC4012B1BA2
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
0x043280727A009592F60461DEEE0CD09D
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
0xADB38DE40FFBEDD291FE41A7B8539C01
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
0xA4E8BA7AFBE42282F02E9BDA6518F78A
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
0x6CB019BAB9901DC92B07ECF53D02B19B
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
0x92E8DC5B3159D6CB043AA8BAD7E5EAFC
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
0x1E2F75B54B5B7CF98933099DBB5277A7
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
0x72F1B6F8066D371A555446E5AE061449

dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched

and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living

blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.

made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
0x36BE242415A060A4A0CF4DA666452DA9
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to

character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
0xB78008EBD63475F89856B705976B0118
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
0x7CCFD38E512B3279FD07F3B75C829E9F
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
0x9686CE79D2ED5574E3F8D8840461317A
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
0xD22CEED0D18CE33FB1D2BE76B9C7AFD0
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.

"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
0xAD43BA29740610FC77FB8E3CF00B3F95
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
0xDE0FFE57DB06F2116DDB294E81592993
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
0xC165BC01F6EC32454B52C63EC4D02D03
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
0xE4F812D4F416F13D73DCD48398844328
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
0xF0F2B52DEFF23B9B2FB539BA795CBE6C
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
0x917329C2FF57522AB9654E33E0D99BE1
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
0x0D68D9816C715F3C7E640D0B007DE56A
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
0x25AE1A25BA8943818459A558E10871E5
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the

surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
0xEEC577B10DEA400B9A891664F4FED24F
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
0x35D7BD24D3EE34F7A8A2A0FD56BFF099
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
0x20BE43DB3ED25BE9A51F8F0363FA4F62
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
0x8F4C12F1AE4D0AFED6C969E0C566473E
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
0x5871DC01CCD173861852333306F2C3FE
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
0xC100E7DDC65F8ECE55BE0DE2A58D8DED
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
0x188DB70057C84EDB8973F446A2FCB7EB
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
0xE4F876D1F59C42BB510B8E14C1109EB7
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
0x9AE019399F38D48FDC17B467FF131C38
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
0x2BBD31FA4C676D5391E8977D303811F9
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
0x9BFE937819E8233264FF0ADE7598087F
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
0x1B66D82CDDB1CE5FB33E6689F8F536F6
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
0xF8372B11427014D43A5FD1A5D5FC8644
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
0x370D0741136671B7BA7138A8B86E88E8
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
0xEC8BE98D6DD5EBEB08F4C0B0984A1BA4
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
0x3A0929626C4210D640AA8BED6E4FABAE
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet

Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the

lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent

my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
0x839524B2216095C7971DE520BDD1C437
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
0x868A746FD0AC5AE7B26B2EE2C1992E44
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
0xEE2039E183A0800987B66CF11AA314FB
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to

eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
0x3D0010A9642180F54B435F161D63A0B3
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
0x1F72DB4211B2C1E9BA2DB48E94FD9E6B
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
0x986A4A896DBFCA2786882B35EA8224F5
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
0xF4ACF182B425AAE4A14B43EB130424DB
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
0x39B75BF91C1EB43D351DAD801B01F400

0x16A29F9F17A3FB80964137556DEA4923
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
0x184B8336F28C1C12B8A8AB48DE8CADF7
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
0x6E19DA718FF16AF31C01C529BE2BBA86
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
0x5FF431E4106EAA4FFB096CD375EB2694
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
0xF5157132BD86EC6C01F897123A200245
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
0xDEBCA483060658AE2B2C14ED2FEAAF5F
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
0x6086EC86DB9104B99F958DEAB7CEC249
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
0x573AFBC1F253A14407C29C1CFC1679C9
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
0x6437D0AD88AA6BEBF44D300162AAAA00
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
0x028B36079A1A7C859427824AEED19793
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
0x3D7607C3E35F4D4CA87929C7D6AA0BF4
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
0xF13AFFAA32118A5BFB63C5F81844F0C3
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
0xC82F0954994F9B059932AD0D2528CBE4
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
0xE9F2ABF7BF6840D57A8390F8A7F94A01
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
0xC98117EEC36EECBA4823536CD3FC047A
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
0x522C43180DA40CCE5634D7478607AA2C
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
0xD93CB81F4136EF00297F4EB38AB49632
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
0xFBDD4EFDCA485D8BC70D96F9AB8B61F2
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
0x2BD6ABA985B3ED0D9E54BAE50FECD27F
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
0xE5EFB761CA855E4B50DFBC3C6B5C7E21
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
0xAE0E22723D9723AC14EC133C7717F3DB
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
0x2EA5AA6133179C38E21281D44205CBB3
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
0x69A8E1E62354DAFBEC136CDF4ABB45B2
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
0xE4D0DFE84EA52F5E8410909731DFF1FC
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
0xA4DD61E5A182546CD2D407855A651630
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
0xAB322F1C2CD709DEEF8820986EC9DE97
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
0x66FD9A911790FBF058D0871B2042629D
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
0x3667A020A907C4358E16B1C06D458D5C
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
0xBCA90CC48451CFCFC8F4F752FCE6C967
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"

"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
0x5C9D576F60022B36F8F645FF647CA134
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
0xABB768E446058449AD6985E4211AE86C
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."

"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
0x9C4EF852EFD44DDD333E25A6534F702B
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
0x7D89DEABCB9486F42D9106D09670D33C
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
0x2CDAEB41C2DF1C2519161BD549B5D6DE
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
0x2D36D36FE0EFAE603DFE836E6D89CCCC
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
0xB5842904E1F0C88E89A42C8A8559C928
Giacinta, and Clara."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
0xA4FFFCB19D4980EFF15F7DBC999958CE
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
0x6E322008321BBBF33B40BE9CEB9C56DD
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
0x5D62341B30BB83AD5EC7EE6F1529AD66
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
0x7368C55AE5E33334F8BA1490E5B8B795
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
0x773CD5A8C50EC7FC220BA526D9FC2429
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
0xB8C501215436078F1316D49ACFB198D3
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
0x273D55FE5498F4C31934D3E93C68AD49
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.

"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are

looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
0x70E1C250329AFDF01AE3806D4C05792A
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
0x78E0C670A90557D8B3461670EE88845A
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
0x3077A3B95EF54DDADF456C1777665F80
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
0xC89AE3D3E63B05049C99A23B6430479A
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
0xE7B554688EBACBA361A1D0FF0F8CF820
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
0x85423DC7B61F7A10C447B0095DF8BBFB
back to England.

"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
0xC3230E91BB2D8F04CFF5F2A837D66CD2
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
0xBD9AF07E2309C3BE3506816D3783351A
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
0x6AFBF7205A0A2E4FFE179C690CED7023
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
0xA0C50E95BD73DDC95C0BBAE2E20EFBAC
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
0xBCEC56517D564842559BBC8FADD2B1A6
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
0xA7CC028E636C7D33E238854BF6D45E6C
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
0x32F037D3E1DEF4654AC7B11C64FB4AE8
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
0x42938BA76FCB256C4A274DCC58B245FC
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
0x318FEC4B6E47EF7D5F5860682CC04CC5
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
0xD229FBE2F672BE995AB955641FD0B7C4
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
0xD7663AF6A5A8899922F941144E065923
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
0x2F1773BE8BEF5A7065EA7C683411D501
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
0xAAB83823DBBF0D0D0C72DC46EDDF1565
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
0xD51DA5AD92A1007C190454676F1A8FEA
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
0xEB4A2512B00952A42E5148232ACE82F3
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
0x215DF94CBA7A26C71DD5C6642CBFF69C
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
0x1A017CB3C2C57428037130E892738787
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
0x2F5F5F55A00186E0177A6FEE162F3DA1
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
0x4E2E35FC5D72D7549A5A9064215582BA
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
0xBE92FF7FD50057D0FD7F499845CF1969
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
0x0F4979F05A43C778F816A04C6D767805
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
0xF919BDEC373C489DC5235865B2DB1BCB
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
0x1D6A6591FF33EE8CD71662FBBD75473B
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
0x5DF2B9870E61E92191431282F827E80E
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
0x2C3BA0C7BB651BADDC059D5ED11E31E4
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
0xCFDCDC0B612FE8C0CB5069C3993A121A
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
0x0FE82169A034238F30A75DEC7D387534
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
0x3E5DC055B08FD9339583018DD73C2BA6
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
0x18C30F42F78BDB863840394391130A0B
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
0x32E8467F6213114C8D341E5E2A5D9BD0
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
0x52B85AD792B1CB5618DA59710602D5ED
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
0x463F7F0763FF79A2DA4534D11EAC1D71
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
0x2BDD514976E71F8ECF138A8A6AE0D610
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
0xBE6DB40D491CDCD0ED730859E72098F8
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
0x824A6ACF6EB3277E71632DAB74C5E83B
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
0x1B0C0C29E8A3002F186016BD33D19F9F
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
0xB2CA2AEC52F6568689256F88CA6D9B85
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
0x8F9EB0123649CC4E0D62FFEC611BCA63
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
0x6F5830D6B794602D145767E2C6458F23
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
0x5EF7DCEF78FCE39B4E92B2CD067DAC6A
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
0x6382E23D3B16B0215BE611BE1CE9FA17
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
0xDC1DE975BEE7B78B10AE6DE2E7233313
out of my sight.
0x0AE68446F27C247DC2AC4BA79588A962

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
0xFC60E435238C8469AAAC3811AF379596
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
0x72ECC057DDD5C88526C89EA4CFA9A5BE
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
0xE541CF2FEBED35E0B7A5A05E05259819
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
0x9B0522196B3A83A60B745E003C66198B
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
0xA32C126DD45507FE2AED95A74BF1FB5A
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
0x216D799D2C6EB489977FA580E1669A0A
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
0x15BE48C30AEF89415B93BD6EAE06B676
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
0x9AF98E8D63FC73C5676FAC2E45329006
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
0x4CDBA78EE5073A05E421AA7DB2B00606
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
0x4D5D3A96D14D842C73A13C5D21EEDEE4
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
0xAAA64F4D50C07DD3EFD9A68CE7404D38
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
0x180CBE421FF9F9145DC31151EA42EAEA
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
0xFE8F276C19A058E7A6265952086FD37F
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
0x01CC7E8CF774ADCFF7D6CCD11C88B952
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
0xEBAB0CC2E563A3BFA2897B01AA569E7E
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
0xF3687A4E7A610D28F99371F80303D623
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
0x6B43CB4C23EA5A1F2127873B2CB28B19
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
0xE08CB640CAE73E91B365B466DA0DA00B
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
0xDAAFA4D98888509E61A2A0BC056C1E62
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
0x06813CCFC01364C0424F23920CBF4A2B
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
0x3161EA82C816084C3AEA4502FF39F771
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
0x65CB92AC16CB51247EFF36823080C7B2
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
0x598A9C91D2396CE36D7AE4813D012F18
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
0x4CAF0BF3AD8EAEAE7D5BAD343B2180B3
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
0x512C69C562E375EAC5D409F11A49365D
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
0xD0B7A2F63CFE0EAF6F2D7EA3F04D2825
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
0xA3A6BD973B885EE336F4C1F51F1C4188
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
0x43701DB4A554130000AD310911A7836F
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
0xE8E9E87055F0CA9A1BA7BEC9359619BA
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
0x7DAEA2AC886BCB7E5E62A01DCD57137F
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
0xDEB5B1DD3C167A7FEE6D21270261DEEA
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
0x6AB39E5C04393E8FCF53AC3FC47E5786
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
0x1EFAB39BABEF7B2C8821B9EDBF8CE785
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
0x0637F6B1ED8A298090E24805A6D7796D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
0xA2F4C16FA1E71987DBA4EAF6FA30BE66
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
0x080E62AC1704EB3265BE53FE9F5692AA
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
0x42425C36AA83059303E9472A1A60F5A4
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
0x7A5D778060213E7ED881DD6B424C5B01
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
0x9CC4364B7594F033CC4729822486464D
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
0xBA62D530553F890E49DA370A5F7F2C1E
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
0x175394DAFA4899EB29D66A0293720B4C
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
0x631E82E2F360FADB6671716EE8C72EFF
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
0x8225F706A179884C804B1F4D3D551383
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
0x49970769BB63F469AA06B7202A07B663
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
0x85B07F08C94CD1F796FF6E9C9B3251F0
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
0xD2A1D58AE292E40E5FAEA922441DCC7E
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
0x69B5B5E313BE05A03253571115D7981A
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
0xDD2C9D443BCC8E0C2F2C4B5FA74AED28

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
0x79CE75AD44FCD5CF9511F32C53FA2969
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
0x38EA26CC8370AA26D5F33CE903C9CA52
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
0x5EAEAFF6E595DD46650F28EAC1BAEA21
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
0xFD927744F28A3FF892540DC4FFD56A8B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
0x19D60E3DCA9A285877D563143466A9E3
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
0xAA30200E141A02710F9E9BAE2522C636

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
0xA852E1439A8B0BE5D7B1CEEDEBDCA7D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
0x1D062E8865B56C8C2323BCC445C275E2
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
0x9E705845A2AC7ED48AA133FF4F9CE6EB
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
0x594304C0D35A767F0AEF68972A777A28
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
0x17529273DF6BB6730443C13E843E4CEC
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
0xF86C1D50E7D5BEADA800370052EA67F0
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
0x8E32AEAF189E10D751913FB961BD990A
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
0xD6D3F42B383840E585AA99DBD65F812F
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
0x33318E0E86BD5C7416DB0E6BE48F58BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
0x8D203FCEF33B18A62BF2FB734147F343
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
0xFE861036270D48B43816CE8F627D823B
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
0xA5B9483A4FDBF2DC8EA43C2E460D0129
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
0xBF76663D922C186A6CF8DA9A2A74F6D6
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
0xA83A3B9034C1CD1622034789EE79274B
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
0xF28A6334F5F8907B8F0C5E9683C51BD3
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
0x17995FEC4EFFF6FE77427DD5E0D98446
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
0x913DD67270FA556254D897A1850CC0BF
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
0x7FD141830EF55FE3C2E2E2D68EEA118E
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
0x8D82C13682D7871858FA8B876CEC408E
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
0x0DBCE08EC2CAF4B16078A270EA58E666
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
0x9A72876A213A642B8491AD08228B2476

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A pause.
0xE0846818AB04C57B622B5F3460F0C597

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
0x0A289B22AACA3B4865A1DB6111DB303B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
0x1D6338CDE9AA82E478E900D833A0E7EA
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
0x18115739E99370E2C34989B7415DE13A
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
0x2172C2CB5A2A76168F7294C6AD270663
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
0x5BC09D58EC76A6AFBF7AED027FA5C1A2
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
0x8F67AEFFE899C470BE2A4424B3ECAE21

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
0xC094E57EA26DDBD880434582A5711709
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
0x398ADDEB37BFB2D57E5178AB0A782548

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
0x62E92629C39E8E9306975D90E90B29BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Another long silence.
0x659816B2820BFF8764A2300E02D4986E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
0xAB2FA9B2FAD5A910C0C5A8279E36863B
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
0x3D208080655FC68F463FD7D380592C74
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
0x61E8BC10F8303DA3AE4D1ECAB8103FAF
and to let me go another?"
0x217905CC9D4230BA682AEA100A8AD59F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do."
0xB3560896B356089618896A464D08A8CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
0x600FF497DD0AFD315E63290D0613449C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do."
0xB3560896B356089618896A464D08A8CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
0x08B9F2598D5868CAC18B944377742045

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
0x28F2F0330D8AED554510603AF15F241A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
0x9567C462ED4D55CEFB9056CC30CCFE55
to love me."
0x6A41A182B6DE791ACCE4CF51016B03FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It would to obey you."
0xC0720F6B1ACCC568ACFF782BB6C56EE4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
0x97F8581F35B82FE9CF9CA2CD81196F93
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
0x5E40474D3D871CCB0613345FDB2D83D0
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
0xBBA7382710D17CAE150160C95B25BA7E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
0xF195D8B2E8271BE54FDA4CD28A43AF31
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
0x34D2238B44C42F3423A84D15D77EA32F
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
0xCDC50A8329F9AD547AF4834F0EE63FA4
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
0x2F1695E6C65616ECB8DD8F4849313BDB
companion and for some hope?"
0x4B6212423377B2DDCE3D48E3797470D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
0xCA379BE92A61DADF3BD4DBDE079A4343
again there."
0x720CC920E9B2959A48B5456E04E2D98C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you will not yield?"
0x5D8FCCECE3605E9953521F5C4CE3179F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No."
0x8046AA0E8046AA0E486CB8A400278AC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
0x4BFD683D1C0C20DFC4D2EF0ABD8605F6
rose.
0xD7558CB1D7558CB1DB50E8F01C0F7E79

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
0x535D2B8E45933B3745262E2E67F11CF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
0xA5CD5634D6E922195625A5CAC590598B
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
0x5EAF7081E0188D44042CC1C11E22D3A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
0x8C200347A740BF1075DD3BE5A9A973BD
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
0x52E4D03EED0A5A4F38A6450CD03B4CAA
will forget me before I forget you."
0x43340F1F0485F3F6B268B5583F141EB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
0xAEAE0D8F500D1CC2BE6B829331DFDC73
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
0x1B728435D77396E48CD4E224CF218935
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
0x7E750708895BBD687D9DE563EB6DDFEF
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
0x73133D75CE4C071999808BD8D5FE0A2C
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
0x9DB9520EB8FC5C560ECBBC453691066B
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
0x3AB5FC1037C5CE8C4D0B3DC4011F7BA8
by living with me?"
0x69B80C062E08A0E796CF25B8CD427640

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
0x0402A938FAAA5C7A54639A46F77C94C9
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
0x6CA9EABB16EEC551E020C4E7F7DA69A7
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
0xEC559B316D495664A7B3F3A2603485E7
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
0x931524D6F570CFDED1E190E51500AFEB
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
0x1D3490666C53E56303D1D757C51E3294
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
0x58C7D342ECE04BD2FBCAC057363083F5
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
0x953D7E674E251B8632E6F6B1CA0FC0C9
who will be injured by what you do?"
0x856D49705A6BC6009E1FF715FFAF2FDF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
0x215A3A2DF43DE1694B0D6418969F47F1
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
0x4CF16399A150DBA8C016045645B131E2
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
0xED2D66FC748791401206B7330FE2A2E5
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
0x909FF87C2EB78A33C5804C1C7E673A89
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
0xDFFF7D856BD79343500DEB18C4E5885A
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
0x5B56701B7C88E84F044D9FF4DD3A66BB
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
0x146BEF5CB2989F88F24E9E06885902A8
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
0xADB07BB24B4332777FF22A166986E3D6
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
0xB7E25DB1F10B9FE15FC9BD606FEE75B0
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
0x00B326D236033BBC56DBA7B421AD83A6
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
0x5F3905D1011A907C4C291A9C46926D6D
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
0x17B7D978549A827FDB9A1387AE814973
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
0xEDC09A41EF476EBA934CC7A9025A6D1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
0x147876C43F6A024E7138735ADB29C513
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
0xB53BC1A8EC4FC8CD3E0F40750D15C985
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
0x77A1C1548C24600EE4D2CA76F476A164
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
0xAD0F81AB57D21C10C54B2B49F699AF08
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
0xFE966AAD153E0820D986F38930F4E712
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
0x1F9D988D39C7B024151C7F9647FDA292
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
0xEE69AF17D5B7283342D7B191E4E711D2
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
0xA903064D91C6699075B092B37150F631
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
0xCFBAE402687A7AF20639E88309B7BAEA
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
0xBA17E08C59E2D31B6904A90A13904188
strength almost exhausted.
0x3131C8992E73D6079A4FC070754ABDB0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
0xB5E61DD3FF0D1E0B20C27925E1E36BD0
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
0x0BB46D25BB8B4B0787BE38E2C760FF61
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
0x089B2FD294283C8B442269762CE6DE96
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
0x3EC841E61518BD4E523F004567F64861
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
0xBC54218441CF24731CE48D48C3CB9351
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
0xCECE941352B6EEF8DFA6D60AC4F63498
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
0x2C9DD334437366B2C042FD162CFE8B94
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
0xC354A241CC384FD1A420A414B1F427FC
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
0x17422AEEF2F6C15F9C71E2368A612CE4
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
0xAE224E27A125151C6663C69BCF906139
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
0xE2D34CDDDAEC21C0A97F956E6094E66C
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
0x9C67FDE839D423BECD71E2DE1C121D4B
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
0xAB1E23BD6B9C6B99003727EBDBB89C5D
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
0xDEB5E5257B91C5DA5F12128B31AE5429
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
0xC02476481FB0E2C90841132668B6F3B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
0x15B5954D35FFF156354CFDCD852592BC
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
0xF9D55CD1F128FC415D655B941C3538E8
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
0xC812D391AFE322817A4C0EA204211712
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
0x4592265512F7ADECBC86F57EE33E6B84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are going, Jane?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am going, sir."
0x9A46BE934AC82C4F164FA4068427AC53

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are leaving me?"
0x1C5DB85EE28AE1F2C542DF45381F1A1E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
0x3D2D4B558F16EB8C18923E8CBB79D7C1
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
0x8F5911AE7290C337AAB10B4652A06788

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
0x54715E7365371F87E33574DB691CD965
firmly, "I am going."
0x51E5ACB8DA8A3A8CA3AEE40B6CF5BB47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane!"
0xE2542833E25428335E94B9A8AC67644D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester!"
0xF7862689E069CD5E11ABF4467F8412A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
0xB68D075FDB1A96FDBA1128FFF0DFD323
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
0x66DFF21DF54B0147FB48D81A7FFC7B8A
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
0x663514BBE0594853B876101130EF8E68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
0x694D0A3A570AA13B34A298860F0835AA
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
0x31F575F0A3697CADF18264759BC1B35E
deep, strong sob.
0x1857793E68FAD9CDD0B9D4BD61F798DA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
0xDED39FB25637445EB1C94995EE18B7FC
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
0x8CA81FD71E65429F70C533A7CB17BF10
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
0xA7BD452CED1E0DBF8D80EE601800F96A
hand.
0xFD0CA8C2FD0CA8C201464B98AC09F85E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
0xC742893951A473FCC29013DFD066EE00
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
0xBDFC347581FF5BE539580C484F6EFFE1
me."
0x5431F9475431F94750C9C3ACA85322EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
0x3D6677734BFC2DCFCC8878E93C9364D4
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
0x9FAED9615EC827CBE0D27DEAB374897D
yes--nobly, generously."
0x5605E177EBBD1D9CC2735C21EB84B54E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
0xCDC8BE62BCA4085694E4412F059AC668
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
0x2FE6185D14501E7ED9ADD965DB1061DF
once quitted the room.
0x4E82C1EE303BCBCD1078262517742CFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
0xF227B75D753D9DF0D04C5A0E1DC7EF23
"Farewell for ever!"
0x62736C70448ED60E202C624DF41ECA1D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
0x05CC091A38F30F29A48EBD925A5EAD3B
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
0x5FCA8FC6C76CCE419EA67BD400C2C04E
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
0x46246B95935C19FD41DF67FFA1716FCC
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
0xAE9196C4D14ED1757FACBE059DBCFF9E
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
0xE0DFEF80938E5ADB7468EDD8094C0F7F
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
0x89B32C731890C48EC579EB3FD2491508
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
0x9F7FC24B4B6C42C95E41D40EC66EF4C3
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
0x6B364664CA7F545609E2649BAD3BBB54
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
0xA1046844AE1FAAD2B7B3F2478FBBCDB1
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
0xEAB75399BE69597690D41659FEC4AD17
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
0x17F3E9806C703C6006EB199BE298B5C9
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
0x4BB0556921465A0EB82A27172C8D5C98
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
0xDBF7D70FF65BAE877574613940BFA3F2
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
0x8765D896DCC5C33B770DD2BF4554604A
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
0x77859C070A760D25044CAA24C25E5C2A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My daughter, flee temptation."
0xF08C5E469EA5A956D325965C93216BCA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mother, I will."
0x718512697056CA07D3FEB32696CD7845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
0x9985261BB1239D32B2A68404CA4AC9A7
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
0x64DFC4943565265BC838F8A2547D57F5
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
0xD27ACAB60151C36386FF54AE33C8B6A2
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
0x8E049066CFD8715DAB8E093BDEB57F53
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
0xC3BC46160074478F948907BF516BBFB4
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
0x237BF74CED4B4E7E9CF8772526372612
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
0xA9D2155CDCA7F2544BCB75A3C9572274
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
0xF4AC57014EA7C81A688D26B6C9B288C7
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
0x4CAF7BA019706DE6AFE2BEA9B2ECF692
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
0xEE525F6DC39673C870556A0324358D74
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
0x3E00801F9387368B34FF90D86F7F964E
from my room.
0xF83A5D4B8BFA75E09DA2FC79DBAEFA1D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
0x1A4BEA10E5B8E358E1EA3583B1B05655
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
0xC017F7320CB3D5C1DBDE6C72A6F7DC1C
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
0x880B81E5184CB4FEF942E165F060D6C6
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
0xF72F95561CD05725F2715BE043724E82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
0x92E1D4D9D27E4939EA8E79E478AD98DB
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
0x20E3977F9A86AA6133778DB39D705559
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
0x140A66D16D6A0C04268658D44F1318AC
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
0x0200BF6C68944B52BD5968A492BF3B7E
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
0xC67A1B4B8546F39A22DCCCB8F02F0305
to go in and to say--
0x8A63ABF9DCC52CE52E470BF13BC1793C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
0x8CF62B39E010EE7F42AA0FA08F62C4CB
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
0x12C5C359C065907F0BEC898A7BE6944D
this.
0xF2199A00F2199A002BB9646A72FBCE94

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
0xE567CB2552BE8BC8564F4C6CF88AA621
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
0xA9195FBBF149C82D055C8C6A94A50B3C
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
0x967B4102E4E846213B37F50565EC7950
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
0xA5CA9AE4C2ED341B3825D890AEB1BFB7
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
0x0A93BAD51766F12CC3014D162239ECE3
on.
0x4B0ABD2F4B0ABD2F4B0ABD2FCB7B29DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
0xAE55F16CD0E7BFD2C93BECE09EA10191
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
0xA230994E45F2C65C130E71F4E7A9CD6F
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
0x86F8690195937E8B06F98388295F3ECE
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
0xFE8E4B174BD156DCDFFEDE80BC8D6962
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
0x641CAF96F75078980FE3540401DFDA3C
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
0x1418EBFF32FCEDFB4804E23E2C492CDB
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
0xC44B661E94B485C16FC89BBA727C420E
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
0x0AEC6F776B13AE77FFFB481A3D4D2023
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
0x5BAE2539189FA7CC33C503D0082EB9CB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
0x0D0A26D377F7F4F6861ADE44D577A57B
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
0xC449673956DBE86E47F509A282848408
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
0x4ECE53CE7A46687EAACC2B03B93105FA
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
0x6EC971EAF4812335FFC5D630346EAFB2
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
0x4B4BEAB826AC90B2CD87554DE8D1FB3D
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
0xCBCD74120FACE505F21A280D5E395542
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
0x3B9E0EF6306C72C4D495D574863A9FA8
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
0xEB298B3BC754B34D61AAC032ABC39D36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
0xDD569545162951BA2296E7952DA3DEE2
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
0x73C55D29130B974B6A7BBB8E96A62EB1
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
0xD13C797EB652E4C1AC7BF96870615082
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
0xD5048BD61C472DC2575BBC64DAE0F181
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
0x1CF77944F79354A9D64C4CA7992B160F
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
0x08576A9F728C6981538E56C27F3BDC2A
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
0x6CA1616A6EC7BE6F80929DF8B30B32ED
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
0x40BFD7A8B8FBF82A47D409F86BD0B27A
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
0x5F4FF2720EC1E4B29D1EC872B453293A
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
0xF131D8651896128B41F99CFAAE6FF6A0
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
0x9F86CD69DCE5F2F40D7C00318457FB0B
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
0xA8E8DBB55D3B12C22988D72B0A1732BA
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
0xCF62CA94CF0D9E24EB00C22D5DFBBED9
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
0x5200FE41DFF5C140320D1E52FAAF7F2A
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
0x22F76E60299E0D271BBF491720ED1019
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
0x1A117515E3304BCB3F47816F060C4E31
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
0x4607B641CEBFB72DA5054137AE3E669E
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
0xB80BC997B37D59F867FB423AD230F330
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
0xD5F7A6CACB0A01211CAAB9884066968F
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
0xEC82D5AFD7D436C0975B67F4F35C8BFF
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
0x2C43B87EC18B6DDABC8B3747BCDBB03B
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
0x917B3C23A3592EFF08627FD2DE112F1D
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
0xA3F1FCEA1937BABF42607D08A9B5ADF2
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
0x3D1AF3B377D943B7E9CFF081BA103D88
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
0x177AC63F766DDBF7B2071EE9C8C5F212
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
0x890EDF44B2C60AABFDA9004052CAAD10
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
0xF819454756CA768D454DB1CC163BE301
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
0x7B09EAA73D42BA1D6E1CD078404FA706
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
0x1DAF8AD41DE412F15077F8063210585B
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
0x0A42461DD0692FB49389A7E2A4FEC11D
ever to reach the road.
0x8C28A0C65C4E51020EFCF30B5840CFE4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
0xEB99264D95141465DB17C02A88813142
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
0xF0D576B5D74E6EDEE8AFD137099A5E31
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
0xAE828A7FFCD3B9E08824298C15C729DC
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
0x0F26DB6C25C6BEFB1B07968527618089
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
0x0C9BAA46FCD045C0D416B10817B67ED6
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
0x040B7FDA55AAD52EFEF6B1CB510062EB
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
0x4C299E52B3B2FCE6817F85A67E1163E4
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.

Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
0x11B8179D81B5B2088A856D4616297D0E
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
0xFFDB869D836C408F00199DE5B6B3113C
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
0x46A29873660865ADA6C683E5F93A38E0
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
0x002E1B94AF15ECB95F4BA8D8794F2D45
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
0x50838F05616F4792FBCAE84B62AC2382
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
0xC870DD7716BD2BC697E2026DECE1183F
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
0x2EDF7EB4BCA74A96B32B5B5577C7E64D
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
0xEAB48A2CA058F42BDFA08E7C7F9BEA65
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
0xC16CA58EC6CDED115E4F59C33194514F
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
0xC49806BB53AFE99A1ECD6DD67487471B
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
0x9947A7A8C9D92DB9EFD0D27424CCA0FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
0xFD8F9EA87144F7C22A0EC354DD4A32AD
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
0x3E7C7C9509BF57E0F049D93E3C0A416B
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
0x1D1129A4D3970A3D470AE56B9AC89535
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
0xC87DC5A5EBC66472B193ADD23E405E2E
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
0x3FDF3A0145912B89B38B9B37FE87C935
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
0x53B55CD06B964489EED2DD932A40DA94
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
0xAFF6CF6D565E0DCEF6A484596B8C873D
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
0xD4AEFC595E482814A2B98173BEBD7878
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
0x2FF39691F9B7E3F85CB8187C38A4FAA8
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
0xC5AF7F01290CD385A05D215D7F2E04D1
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
0x00FE0571374E536680765031F9C7D9F3
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
0x44B8006060B97326C623C1591E625419
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
0x26EBC8E89FD047CDCF3A4C6BB53BACA5
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
0x41735B8B2D4BDF146974DAA972C0CFDB
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
0x305B77AA97C7BC4507BBF355AE75FFDC
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
0xFCFE415E78BCE6071E62BA5173C30580
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
0x91552CBEB4F61B37EC8F815F876B84B9
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
0xFEA1B9C6A2B0577A7587617A71777552
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
0xD8B737E56205255B759EB20DEA9A5FFE
will seek her breast and ask repose.
0xCB8BD7E9B5CE1D273DE3C7E17F89880B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
0x03978B22499B58C501A63936F64E290B
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
0xFAC0B65979B68019DA8FB08A669040BA
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
0x5760DBCD4B8938F374D578CFD85BEDF8
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
0x0FC52529359AB72983EEE7DFC85E22DE
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
0x0A1CF3C72EC77DF7FF72CDB4201DA0C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
0x3691AF11251CDB4B800537B5F6CC5F3B
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
0x7E9FCEBA92F2F6C94020E5A21E561646
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
0x0E8C1830D73C678E9802E18A4CF1C899
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
0x9002D0C52E76FBD12A83AA2D264A68C5
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
0x9D63B2B542C981DC510B9B8087F2089A
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
0x255AA5E5074ED4FF1BB3E419FF5363D9
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
0x8D70EB1BB1F5958AAC08C49118596842
regained the faculty of reflection.
0x9F65D21FB07B7953ACF740584E464C26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
0xEE7131B49CB499A7C80FE57F0C6A7F1F
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
0xCE9BB735B222FF683B053819FC6146C1
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
0xBE52A465BB507E89D962ECEABAA728D6
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
0x17D81BAA13693B289DF0C3B4A190F519
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
0xE2BCD19ABFA860033FEF47DF0A55FF0C
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
0xC3185E91D66C68A628AB8DCD97D68EFC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
0xAF7D56EB24219AE4B4D5D3BF8ABB34D4
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
0x8CD630BF22B5715CD214692DFD5049EE
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
0x623805F740D2DA815A004834194109FB
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
0xF641F7186AE3AD408A1DC7AC1A9BFC2F
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
0x36157428506B2F9CEBD2836CF3D4A29E
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
0x70618822D0DAEE682B4D7C4BCF72C186
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
0x7A6C4C6D8D5FC10EE68B33981ECE0242
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
0xB401F9C0B17A235504DA8DE29A0F033C
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
0xD6339B494535FBFBB3AB7D927755A9DC
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
0x1D0DC2B0A475AD026D40FEBE8B0F6FF8
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
0xF0C2D5B55133EC1169019AE7F941045A
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
0x01EDD01159D27456FEB26AC39A895774
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
0x2602FD23834FC8DA080C2576DCABAB1A
then chose my couch.
0x305346A79F0EC82BDE006F256FCCCF60

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
0x9F30F8098FC1795494733ADA98B9D2DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
0x27D16D4F28614C7A4753C897708C7FB4
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
0xA27424E8C7B2073EF2E40846979CC59F
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
0x17424B19D5D39DC91163EDDE5BBCE55B
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
0xC7A7041B76E816CDDC65FF7293FF1C1E
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
0x20A71D87F255929C125CAD2A1F5196BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
0x471E4F2D7F16F2317BB97950B6DB300B
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
0xFBDBC1AB2E9AFCBC3AA0EAF6A65DC61F
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
0x96E2BAAE5FBC2B04B31690E5A6036F1B
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
0x992C82F234CEF680EE084E3C8AC659E9
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
0xCE3BDC4D0A763A10CB81310E37752689
attempts to seek him.
0xE02FF6D198CB9C9CE31D79ABA75E2990

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
0xE86665BCC5880F8E1D892055745CB172
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
0xC421234D1EFE009D0ED6E6B5E702C7BE
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
0x401B7BC8483A25CD478E28FD0499FBF8
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
0x54B611FD44041EBF0EEEADEDC45B75EC
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
0xB4ED9D532FDC04A2A90795C831892059
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
0x801FB71AA7EAE5A8B954189FDC322F71
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
0x4FE4A0166F352B21FD4E5315CFFDF09B
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
0x226BD2CBFC1801E263E3C39305838A90
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
0xA8BEB507F1A1C76594E0E0BCF38A28BE
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
0x20B26783DE9CC4324FFEE890BB3F80E3
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
0xD81622EE3F3FF636970069F27A603502
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
0x95202A750F2DC854561B64D0409A3706
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
0x95B3AF281DB5712BCB00F77F034DA44E
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
0x10B6AA66BDEBC2FD50E4EF8F8DDC10FF
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
0xDF91E16ABBAC410B9462E5534BDE6317
sleep forgot sorrow.
0x3931F0022F108052F841731168DA1FF9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
0x63FFC57CB8F517F6B20398DF5D609531
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
0x65627886C05C979D1DC25C4CA944ED5C
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
0xE48ED2E20C67988B209A8E6638C53812
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
0x659605C6ECA03ADEEF82FDD26AB83906
looked round me.
0x242A63919795CE2AD27F87BB269D0D2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
0x8FB0E9D63E4D89B51B4FB1863F4B5305
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
0xECD37A7329EF7BABB3571855D5ABECEF
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
0xFC26B064A99B3089BE8B0550B0677C93
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
0xF22127F3CFDAFE9BBA3C1173649DBC1F
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
0x32E9F01AADF0D4D977C49FB0727E11A5
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
0x14DE04F471EFEC9DE87BA2895F905CC4
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
0x34F3C4B9516194B0B9EB154400E78EE4
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
0x1EDB88ECBE7F2B2B9E68A2EBA2D08E58
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
0xCAC7D6041D464B6B550C98108B5611DF
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
0x31C6BDDDB049A359FA5779C003DB6F53
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
0x81C2F0F1E086EF8ED37790477414E589
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
0x2803C200B83859ACB7B36C9D182E152C
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
0x515D8F8F435B751710D8E2F3460786D9
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
0xAF01DCD30E4F9C08AD53CBE20899EDE2
out.
0x517D4B94517D4B945BFB3B1BCCD0F81A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
0x8773A7FB6B1742CA4F0137D4C5A2090D
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
0x1BEB17C4911EC36DDD798191F6EE9234
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
0x4751D738D7B6A9060237440D4B0312EE
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
0xF1E3CFA13CBA91FC77E236D42EA0FFF7
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
0x3E99DBA05DC12AB583ADDE5479B3499C
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
0x19B7DEA710F9A80300F376EBAE6C582D
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
0xB3717315427ABE811367104E9AE7D321

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
0x6B5EBFB94F43C5DD9B031CE919C67AC2
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
0x51EC74391AF32EFCA208E397ACEEE3A5
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
0xF07BDF46754CCACD3BAC28671B3D7FF4
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
0xEF98AED86EE92B860767E66A759FE45B
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
0x6A7D741EB4DBE2BB24A5F7C45EA2C4DF
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
0xB8CA05EC2C94E8D787FB5EAF6455F17A
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
0x4A2310F6E7D87C378D2C61791A44724C
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
0xEAD3B23041325A13D209997AE2F1A115
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
0x64D7B668B2A297CDD24131FE0B72B64A
like the rest.
0xA6E89D2A9B8B78A1E81EC123F8CA8F96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
0x0DFD5A8E4A0BE1E89FC03FC97374F52D
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
0x51EADC8FCC740171B590BB3CF65AC3A3
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
0x26885B7C63EF54E834832D9EF16CF719
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
0x60466AF56858A6A78E733999B5218259
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
0x0A5FFFDE567913B91AA7C6599CA1AFD5
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
0x2B8A699347D44435172C5E07F710A84B
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
0x7AB0E613B45C0F25F6F91433C286578B
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
0x3C49680C4DAB5A5BA563188A9143A34D
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
0xB0307584D97283896AA777A6AC3F5F3B
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
0x702762F292BA40AC75DE57B669C4FAE8
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
0x74FE6F843496F81B35EEE3FE1F2AF01D
would not; but I must try.
0xC3D29680A47AFF9BBF3BD1E212771336

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
0x9704CB334B762D3C644F89457594F9E1
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
0x1E11BB083704CA9C9A8CF40C96386E9E
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
0x98BE63DE65868DD1428EC08926979E53
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
0x131734AC6F2446357E66FF1A72D2344B
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
0xF56947DCE5749207F49D1679521B3E19
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
0xA2E88DA573DD7E0C80F06D0A86BB05A4
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
0xA5FBC34B948B050655D52726C657CDF0
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
0x50B845B0C3C7F3DEB0545C28CB7883CB
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
0x7528DA63460BBF27233B0465A567EBFC
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
0x36EC5039D3A83D2A08E45B8D9B17C9F9
the village?"
0xED7C3D617AE78831771029F703EAEA57

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
0x42C1F756C062107C33C1FD354B78C3DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
0xD695040F3A37417EC63D814F23EC8F6A
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
0x286E5F7B09D46994675AAEB825AC9222
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
0xFB63FCE1A9028DC29E9D36F93873825D
apply somewhere.  Where?
0x08C472B336788877C3E60C9C6598AB52

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
0xD4A1C274AC3C8EB16C781FED2AA6761F
wanted?"
0xBE9227CB51B98BF5C4577C32AF7A4F5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nay; she couldn't say."
0xB4D6A8EF8A1262D26D815205A3679481

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
0x11C39666A6730DC96BB7B776D2329B7C
do?"
0x4A98457A4A98457AB344609E84AD7D0E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
0xCCCEBB49C378C7ED76A4A330E429A1F9
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
0x83622C52BF32922624E40CB64F7C486B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nay; it was men's work."
0x7A01085DF8529D0635C40F4F51165DE8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what do the women do?"
0xC2BE14A1B2C51A1441633FE683956359

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
0x605946DD9569C6DBB283314BB887F687
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
0x5E2AB778BA74A1E63DC5D1BD5A950ADB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
0xC89E0D4241C97486FB3E51A31530A44C
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
0x817F2639CBF83F070027C6D7276A28DF
wanted.  I took leave.
0x6C194B38A7A07681BFEACAA8A7000ED0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
0xA32DCA5B3F128F1F1429E027BCBE927A
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
0xD12A75DC109245374D2C046E9CDBE101
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
0x7B26EEBF5CD2AAAA2B7C771BC906FF43
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
0x7DBCCEC5FB5521625092E0CDE18CB597
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
0xA348AB323AEC294FEEAAAFFD61E2628D
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
0xCE01C906B289B6CC8F43A2C6F0C22BDE
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
0xC973B38941DB51F946DCF875446998A1
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
0x276496EDD9CA709C82AB520181A2905F
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
0xDC5E394CF39CA90E8FAF4B1F70E681C1
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
0x637632B4E0B0B0E0107685B65077568A
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
0xA9DDD0D12B4C8F9AB7E01963E4F3278F
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
0xC5C42EB5B9B20ED9091B4E669B85A8D8
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
0xEA9A528DEC512B5194E6CF94786EEDA5
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
0x1FA8891A21A372162CF69577486A4A65
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
0xF81F9B230C578AA0FCBD36159556A0E0
if a servant was wanted here?
0xB65B4F08F7B70BEF8659C57208F043E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
0xB91A8B1B06A951221E011D24F6C8C1AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
0xF62EF5F9E8BA4CB0E8F38251A09FB266
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
0xA631F1500A3010D39945C016E15B651E
no matter what."
0x83638D756D9BE5DC343CEC0FE6BE8DF1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
0xE7C94E98512286E3BEF90E89549889E0
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
0x499B79236055FEB3C677ED76E5DD301D
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
0xE494B9000EA0698E1FFDAA4FB46FBCD2
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
0xAD2FDF402382B809AFA03BD816A82366
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
0x7962A35FF1A721CF4D7E1999A0238585
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
0xBFF2974C6D3F55E2ABC9AA771008DC76

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
0x75D0BD1FFC3C19DD3B2394E68CF066CB
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
0x753F7CD372D3199820C14420D55C55E9
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
0x10148B9108496C458DCEB4462B48DE2E
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
0x1ABF4A1EF75F05C1CE938C1689369727
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
0x5B42F4A505433DA1CB8FC70EDE8C71D0
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
0xB57DD8BBA9E5BDC379D713096E7CFF6F
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
0x190655C0009E9E33D7427490689BB62F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
0xF40B258AFDD5B70E72002A55878D0F07
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
0x662E3D973B2F9DF27D6D72CB0CE32B95
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
0x5B930FD0F939990FD94DF14605D27D2B
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
0x444138BD2FC1047DC3A65F48147FBF76
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
0x2DB3DD04B11B5C5892C2ED904723EE39
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
0x0151DA0EA9015A154FCB3AA6E11C31BC
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
0x1CE4B192F63E58A2B8BC48196B686C2A
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
0xA8ED4FE386B2F96C57B39D4AC15180E7
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
0x5F6486FE42BE59F7B8A0ED39DFE465F7
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
0xC4D48B9A58E580EAAB8ED5377D0326B2
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
0x1D41C3038C3887890E6BE63479F3E2CF
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
0xBFD6215687CD0D26588C6D85D8F78DAC
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
0xD4C19EA0513834404694F3ABE4F99626
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
0xF56DE5B8A3513E0E70EAB1C8870F1568
this the parsonage?
0x8F9523F63FE59B2EAF8DBF92887AEF31

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Was the clergyman in?"
0x63331B8BD595BD46C2FA3B8108CDFD2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No."
0x8046AA0E8046AA0E486CB8A400278AC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would he be in soon?"
0x329CB076EA57C184EC91416452D49503

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, he was gone from home."
0x9DE2546E43C104AFB0E4D3074C7A8659

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To a distance?"
0x2DB479117AD3B0A81EA15361FCC41AF1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
0x8356480B2D6B858CB30D2EC0042A99E9
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
0xD02B2E244C561FE0D1B4C9C030A827F3
there a fortnight longer."
0xDE903CED4349EB29BA12ACBE3AEF3D17

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Was there any lady of the house?"
0x2915F73117B5E5BFC55BD3E455AE49AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
0xACCBCEA8251B70A8EAF26E8C5F52B55D
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
0xB5BE29B365D246676777F7E3D12B84CD
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
0xB3B75F595A5957BECFA705AFF1556423

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
0xA43CFC8CECC83D963DDE8E8E4977AF99
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
0xD442B02DFC0D8DF7F8C96A9A529F0769
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
0x332B8DFB0D8DE4630C177BC0D6A2E590
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
0x1ECA55961923D322F6D66A13A9C67E56
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
0x7B6D1DE716DBC421376540F29F3D2C22
for this handkerchief?"
0xC45C59FEBF93CD103D3905D0A295FE24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
0x8556C15A0E9F3668AD9E7CA82F5AFC3A
that way."
0x0ADC7D2F0C57698E7D77586E66270311

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
0x94883E84798A7D86467ED82662343FBA
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
0x69473917C1E3701F34D8F8562FC60BA9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would she take my gloves?"
0x7C4AC28157431964D5D8171EB15D97A9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No! what could she do with them?"
0x5C4472E54E5D7C7D7EB2F91579C9D3BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
0x1D52B8143D245A9316FCF0E83B2B2E4E
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
0x4FB2252D9E8505F32595901D4C8D57E9
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
0x87744E60BAE2AE3E8F685CA1B6FB98A8
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
0xDBC0F5AC8D477A52331FBE4EBDA4A45D
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
0xD4CC7B450AB44207AACCF4AD282C9D66
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
0x4A4B46E1FA3486ADC9EA9FAD38B8A9AF
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
0x5B920FB8AC21700B9085B6F20A0DF405
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
0x6956DFFF7E39923FE9694D7F14470277
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
0x81C51033C20F481184708E89F9135306
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
0x0D4AF6C708AEAC55E8BF01B6B6826755
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
0x97BC167296370AA2A69A458E970FF564
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
0x53E9CD15E7FEEA589310B30FADEF10A5
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
0xC8AFEFDDDE9172F31792D409E0811718
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
0xF30B93836C61CAA77A7362CA2CEC72DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
0x44BAD95BD6C23B5B780FF59CF23190B0
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
0xD2531FDF75C8105EC5A38F22B1FB0BE5
said--
0x86CA0DB586CA0DB5502F29F4A081027F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
0x5262A87C0C8829764BBF6DD5F18AE461
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
0x0237986C994751356613530A6D1F3F34
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
0x7C8494B75C382A105D5D95195CC7CD33
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
0x83F12CAF1D5EEF9338D9BE49363E7EB8
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
0x6F7C06F21E68D820541525900D00F9A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
0x56CFE5AEEC781057DEFD1E007A69D9E6
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
0x3C948B1F6AD43719E977E494D05AD8FF
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
0x36A7C06051C7078ACB53641474CF2541
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
0xC4C9C4C14868ACFC15F141E0C09BF9DA
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
0x1E3163EDBB976187B94B3265BC44F5DB
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
0x9AC61BB6447D8D1A15247BF9EF79A78A
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
0xE21115C1DA0128AE845F8BFE477B0447
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
0xA7B10BFE8A298F88DBF1A8AE9DA64D23
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
0x12FFF428571013F0D14DF322FA920E12
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
0x5D45036BA763B52D46A3CFADDEB258A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
0xC14083123537D4DEB763FE5E62853D66
give her these porridge."
0xCF8B1D98E7F4C9F3EA886F756E2FF82F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
0xF1B038809CE267209D11AE099C1A3BF9
pig doesn't want it."
0x7E6191517C6CD7D4EBB8646420060579

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
0xCA711B7077317FC97446BA1FB584EC5C
ravenously.
0x2D649F09AD82B2BC256F07A5B3F84D8D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
0xD2599A2005500B0A12858D6EE1BE94FE
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
0x1AA8272BD41727F0B0BBB7F47E0B9CB7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
0xEA257E7642432F08C5FCCEA0BB2F8945
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
0x9E91E53198FD6AD4F8C536F3532D53C6
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
0xD8C1631C4EAD8CC45EE03616F01E554E
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
0xDD505AB4607813414EE9F38B78D3D129
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
0x3285B1B91DF0C004765A9C107F09BB04
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
0x8E9BD11442810869DD7FB817C27923D9
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
0x36E4E7D5A9E82B6DE63F9EE931D2A80B
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
0xF1B50E9AA630B80D812AACEFC16B9364
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
0x7E4707F6FDD182E6ADEFC42AF1D0B3F1
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
0x25DE274F10DDC3BF423CBFA0C4684B94
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
0x2176AF8349B25CC4A6F050C00FB279E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
0x293FDC2D00B4D4598E543F9AEC0C9A33
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
0x37742D8FF66C66C7F0314B6393EB915F
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
0x3EE7DADE58F7A5FB920E0ED70767E8E2
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
0x487C234AA5DB0538B53A697C580BF3CD
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
0x1C5A6321E833D98D32D2FCEEB0666B74
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
0x621DEDB43C3B8D4355536262DB7B4F5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
0xA1BC192E89CE5DA24E84A12C1A3F8014
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
0x1A97AE12FA94DBC84BF678BE57D6B0E6
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
0xFECBD917E90FF534D856EF712E95ACCA
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
0x191AFC8B58640D0825577BAEF90EAD5A
grave."
0xB73E9BC8B73E9BC8A3D4435BD6BCCBE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
0x5C20E599307C61CB9BE0E1CD361D08BE
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
0x3D1A03E7A81969C0815C374E76986980
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
0x18971D8E67D110825866E3C1C58BB516
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
0x707AB4DB953A67AA427F9137B04980A6
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
0x512F53DF9E171B3F7EC2AA45C6EA8DD2
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
0x063729F0595A53440FA088BC5FF43F41
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
0xFC7FA91E474852C3353A63F2F6949481

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
0x0BE75696BE891AE85A9B7650575F5F0F
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
0x01C04AC797975B83F84935381600F9ED
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
0x8AF9D96399C8FFEEF0ADD404785EC275
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
0x4589A08AAC68FE565777E48504EEBA46
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
0x3846BEB62A4DB52ABF3DE6F4E3FCB499
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
0xC8D8D7276FACF045B608D525BA782264
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
0xBFC9E4CD75CD02DD0CB238DCE4D743EB
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
0xFB79E5236D77F441920C2E747C73DBF3
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
0xF8B53A1461EF0BDB661B059C29F70668
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
0x23E4AC99239172C1D83281E8FB85DA26
it shut in my face."
0x8B1ADC5D93CD0E87D3E910074470B288

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
0xCAFD0010BBD4367DBA6A07D4799AB65F
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
0x6D0AE03F7AE7B90DC1243F5A50562DE7
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
0x4797C4412C93AB560CDB8A4403605B3E
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
0xF9A25E4C479670D01C61DEC9ED6ADBE3
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
0xF9EFDA3087E20080B9954AEF73A669DF
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
0xE941DCFE1C39B0D003CC15C075815D63
long.
0x80729A9580729A957B54F1696E9306B7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
0xE0A448B877C4ECE4A636A77A848B4FED
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
0x9253FD9304E0DE7CA4C11A03E96A7B00
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
0x6D6449A8CF5C25A0C935D3DE70417052
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
0xEE5A1116657052DB0AA08EE0AF9E657B
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
0xEE0220E6AA71E93ECC94D481E12EF426
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
0x01F142975E36CCE4574780CED99C71D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
0xFBE74CB9D5CC94F9399ECB1684A1E29D
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
0x0C3A1BC221C748CDB13E5DCBAA06AE47
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
0x3A6E63BA86B137326044560B53FA4DE9
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
0xBB75AAAAEE12F8380E7B6DD6DFC46F8F
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
0xFEB5C25B58BC9CAD5D52EF93109D1105
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
0xFC6CE24962DDA4E8360161F47D36D8F9
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
0xAC7B793E8675A90DB61F0435921FDDA5
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
0x5BF2E6C5082707380307D425BDE83D8F
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
0xAF8E7B1383B3499DF4F0D3936273EEEF
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
0x48EAA70EFD4AE772BB3FFB3934D6CF49
sable bush-holly or yew.
0x890AA43BA9ABDCD30EB7DFF367339C92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
0x396FED64271B5D71627AD4F55EA75B0F
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
0x7AB40BCC462FD2740444FDB7BE9F87A3
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
0x8420F097AF06BBD1F89DFC802069CE65
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
0x7BB5E457996CF1EA7D35EB4BBD940DCF
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
0x547EEE029B4EE32AFA1FADEB2C414899
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
0x087515BA770DA3A6041ACF0F70BAD596
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
0x8A44FEA6D043FD7BA5D7FF71C80650DF
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
0x56CBFABBC4D47CBA567A53A2F513E492
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
0x5E836B4B18A805C311B821A619CE6120
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
0xB25997A17BB20B802A31C5DC2043D967
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
0xAFCC0A18460F6ABA6A07430819C87E1C
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
0x6A1725DDD5CB9248D77A136983450CE1
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
0xDEFC0B96C8338B0F89C8E37F13CD0F5E
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
0x46125D22306D6969245B5DE098977448
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
0xA350E75B3FF5D4931FF4C4F95C0487DB
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
0xEBB6DDF90A2671052B2566443C5AB4C3
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
0x9B0A7A625DDC40DE7AED90F74E59294D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
0x4C9EF295B98BF6095AC82DAB08B5EB70
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
0xD7C06D0A33914AA3226BF8233A9C8AC1
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
0x85104F03F0C9F6258A0EC8237E18E9F1
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
0xA3E6D03703BEB80E1245C89E02EF5A90
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
0xBAFAB380865706C4D495056C91F55DD4
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
0xCF70737379214D39AF94E106B6E1CB02
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
0xA0776F8FC3A9CB4B457E74EC4D03EE40
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
0xEA8DEDA8DAD1597F3F3C6969E5913504

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
0xB3372F5E296671BDF98ED0484A3E5DB7
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
0x3296485437AE1B4EC280658BDEF71C0F
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
0x8FEB5CD743BAC902C105ED49DCC45087
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
0xAA238286E20761935FB307289E2E9F9A
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
0x94B4EC464F9F8F52D5E1E554E3F7B888
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
0x1063F9DE5BACDC3EE765992F7F26229A
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
0xC5792F42D0DBFCB5BAC8AACD99BB12FA
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
0x178C30338BECE737606BEB33D232FC01
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
0xB76E45687D4DF7E0C6FADCA30D6C89CA
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
0x6CBC8019D7BDC01ACFF5631BD1E82B52
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
0x5F9C6CD65B8C954D0693186BDD2E2A25
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
0xBF639D99E883A543655FD23C175EE870
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
0xC378E089989B2D674CDBBF8FBB7DE8E8
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
0x753D82F35C0256480BBE2558C53F9D9A
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
0x137B1200A04A2F2DFCA5F4FB3537C3F5
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
0x91F8E4B6B076852E906785D43BE7062D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
0x3619EE2D0799E1723ECF49F29FAD19FF
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
0x6B79562C9BBC45586C30CF9E0AF1FEFD
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
0xB15DDE58E2502EC579C4B8B41283AD66
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
0x46797DA120F93EBE249E3EE6482E8087
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
0xF845BD97C0D575AFA0F8DAD36F868F06
German I could not tell.
0x5C195128C85DECE62E1FFDC4DC34E6D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
0xECBE8BB95800F8A09E9FAE70FD6EE92C
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
0x9824B9A07CA90EB43D9A90061F9614FD
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
0x8CBD5DDFD3C87EA2EBB3B81EE67C2AC4
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
0x24ABBD8AB6314967CCB3C51DF481E348
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
0xD03A910536432DF8359F211AB5BC428F
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
0xD828B93D4B2E758AF94C28AE56A21D70

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
0x07B7972EA7457C905DC90D339DC49AB7
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
0x729FBD11A671A360EADBD42857F6DB52
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
0x5F778F1E1D2D22A15843279F04F953A0
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
0x30C6F5463981F2D49329A6AFC5D9CE76
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
0x78CFBDD7B14298DB497892570E2D2EB1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Both were again silent.
0xF30DA57F18CF331745EAA413C32FB60A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
0xEFB522DFF6D1CCB82D9199051C19002A
looking up from her knitting.
0x9A713C2C1FB59041E00DECE8E2267E95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
0xD7E98385E4071FE27CDAA1B06671D7F4
other way."
0x3DDC51FA0E57C475D5F04508B841B758

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
0x322934DC6031FE5C4C5DC4780F539865
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
0x6068BE384F8F5166CAF9E879DE9B32FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
0x481AC56B68D2955C71FD4C651C7808A6
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
0x391D3A76135E3EC300E687413596D5C4
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
0x0BFF0BEB3C687A59E4BBE694E83AB27A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what good does it do you?"
0x88F15F933890A63C40A9A82063C21C47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
0x4AD9014F91038314CFBBC4BADFDF4A98
and then we shall get more money than we do now."

"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.

"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
0xE34290C79994AD544345F80901E1EA22
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
0x86C580B8D129A71BB35C282051BE6073
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
0xF692C395871C514482F143A2D1E0B3B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
0x1E9EBCD1A206B545A72B57B9AD461377
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
0x7872B52CA85D05E128D2323865B3868F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
0x14B10A0875F87E6EAFC9A857570FDD7C
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
0x49C6CE8B7E37E243E773979D03911898
sad now.
0xF70EAA5E7121B428A3F86F9DB5A71FCC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
0x67D82377F91F782F547E422EE3C4C670
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
0xC7E75AF56A62D2275FC412856C2EA50A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
0x64F2623346E9DBB58AD2F4D2EA7419C4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
0x27F25ACEB2CDC02037B01BA6E1455CAA
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
0xB854AF6C4250D570B14BA49FB8188613
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
0x819DC558CCF505264DA627C41C8A108F
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
0x16FB58576FC40D98C9009380E30AD883
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
0x35903389C156F9E54C2C1B10626F0CA8
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
0x1B9EFD19CA3166940BA740D9E585F583
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
0x934D45A5C65EC14E38CA279749586E7A
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
0x68D514AA33E5CB0FA2BBFF4CC31D8A46
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
0x2A06C4F0174E470518F5CBE7470353CF
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
0x0DEC6473FC164AF9671AA31FD8F17227

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
0xE9042B7930DB29171DE0FDF382DCA8D0
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
0x9D56ED4F34588B99BC0631BF78C53B7F
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
0x4E67465745DCBF1601E9BE4197147B17
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
0x6DB03F277B8CA897F7FD60789105BFE6
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
0xECD1D1BBED38FDDABEFFF0D2276C8DA5
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
0x6B7464C87A0863034E034B224E6BAA0F
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
0x9BD72B23DE63B148A00BCB3B9512E05A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
0x148CC0C2D1B00200402BEFE0ACB751D0
St. John when he comes in."
0xDEB5D1492DD113F35F5403BAD1AE8A38

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
0x28607652647D3D684AD754FA32BE76B7
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
0xD13CE4415DA13B9FE5257E8D6760CACD
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
0xF2E82E6C17C3389977341B999EC879CD
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
0xA3EF14B431E4DA1608BF8EB1B6E2D3BD
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
0xB6195B16F2D6FE6A1B4E6C9882DB79EC
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
0xCE763C05D4F16BD374EA59E72D172E65
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
0x06D8BCEC4F67ACEEAC45B11F0A765BA2
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
0x7248922D25C11F03F519BE2A12A2EE44
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
0x878A260928B37137F72C21E1A8D70F02
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
0xF1DC812B63D0E11DC49C97606F4CD96D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
0x3334F6A8305CD6DDA558F2724E2F3CE0
me by the light of the candle she held.
0xD35F872655ACF91091E588380FE757E8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
0x9C3C0F26AACF3AC9290A7A064DAFF9B9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
0x547E7F66C6C13AD1A11AADC6BD1B9833
from?"
0x61EDF95061EDF950110F0D84C2781649

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am a stranger."
0x7A7793DAA4295D77A3F9525CAECC2767

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is your business here at this hour?"
0x300DB8FBCF2C71B939663B72FBA3A217

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
0x5AF0C51A8625457EDA248B813371247B
bread to eat."
0xE008D1E99C6E96E5A70D53D028FAEA68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
0x605E595860E091FAA945941884E1822D
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
0x337D54B630141ACD93D22FFE4AB4A965
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
0x7392B22DE0314FE8798F4568C7E3DAA5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
0xEE25837965600941B70431CFDE0EE577

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
0xC040E1C8A5B434F2300475301D9FF45F
now; it looks very ill."
0xA236FC53272AE40C1CD68772B1903A81

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
0x1A3C17E868B43C4710A3BCD2D502B055

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
0xDB11E3C7DE711F60C8DAD7DB1F08BF14
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
0x71FC63F3CD4AA1A712389780A893493E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
0x93C2215EFFE8C8146C2086FC7C8A8AF1
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
0x29AB5F20FDC7A3FD8D17E8EE77C3F1C8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
0x3625800A55EDFB1B36A260FC91FAAD8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
0x9C30DE74EE70ACE75F22D69B6965E342

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
0x2A607F198B2D1A6D599743EC143ADA02
make such a noise.  Move off."
0x5AFB8226A8F97BA87D488C480E9A69D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I must die if I am turned away."
0x99335A31CAFBCD91B3F3C29C6C61EBC5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
0x472F3236489A7F96B378BF501F223B1B
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
0xBBBACE2BD35A7B65C953E94B86DD2727
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
0xDD33B3EF59F3557B881681A9A9DB30FE
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
0x56B555DCA7DD38588092ED409DC88240
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
0xB9862DFFC6FD38297C340D2FF17E8BB0
bolted it within.
0xF4DFF65F7B706526C836556DD2AF77C8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
0xE7564D655623D991DD6CE31F1B3BF10D
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
0xA9C6CA64F9F0FBE46FA5DF4CEC75B51F
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
0xBA94C3482DDF5897E4FE533ABD3E32BF
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
0x247B362390257508FB30C94932B08347
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
0xE902AAFCC8AD259513360A49132B8F76
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
0x39DAEDA73BE25FE0239754B0A133E079
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
0x71DF2917BC2C4CF359AB7695FA01A6C0
endeavoured to regain.
0xE86E5345C571348D31606A2ABEC4F3FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
0xF0FB62236E872FC09023C19ABDBBC81E
will in silence."
0x7F59CC6B5E5BB56125172DCA9FB1889E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
0x5C5EA11B131FF3C401068F901515459B
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
0x352664CF151384CF7C36ACB02B907EEF
and still.
0xA1BA56127FC889B4997F2BA5F90248AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
0x6204A81B252847B5EFC958D6BF3A14A9
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
0x635408C896C2C6510C0C0D42C36550FC
if you perished here of want."
0x9FFE15DCCB07EEFCEE49C424C1166C39

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
0x2AED873FAC334F01C127247318F566F4
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
0xFE069B74C26CE1A397A9752501A8E8D2
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
0xC06B2E3BDEB8DEB33B9358B157D0FFCC
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
0x1B0853F01A23A105E1DB76E2AF1F317F
to the door.
0xA454FA83F70F6956F4CDD3A87668F98B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
0xE7857DC038DA05D9398C0096CA48653B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
0xA52B40AE084FA52BF972FF490B95CE91

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
0x44D6D3FB92A9EA7E4DAB250303B72347
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
0x3DB5DBB2B2387E786C9261AF4B7C2846
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
0x0F748EDBB08960C1D3B633082A9D8DC0
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
0xE64386E1B35DDC3091420EEB3070B687

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
0x60DA7481BBE223F75220D238822E85E5
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
0x7908747534A622087219EDFF235C9B81
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
0xC02D5BCD1F94D021DBB1D59441E45A5F
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
0x4DA53A3642C4985BC6CC1413B9799EE8
house."
0x97F9085D97F9085DA9AE178AB93C64BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
0x2D782F0521E9A83D6B9BDCC04B2C8B8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
0x64F721BFB73CC13A04576EFDDE1D68D3
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
0x0AD49508117146E94B8DA8EC0BDD3BD7
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
0xCAFCE517060908E7C4AA99FE1D8BFA1C
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
0x9592683231635381A3B0E5349FD8E4E0
me.
0x4E106EDF4E106EDF4E106EDFFCA050BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
0x8BCEE9873CB69E1F9E6BEAC8F1DC61DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
0xB8D5D4D3EF549F5ED8CD7FF092210843

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She does look white," said Hannah.
0xE50BCA37806D3959AB2B9DEF45B2C131

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
0x5C93CD039CE82480AC28B5AF527560F2
sit."
0x1AB87A3B1AB87A3B6A04730868D6EF93

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
0xC169928973745850CB4F22755CB6E8CB
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
0x4A347EE14C46C82AE7D1E70869FE9212

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
0xED8D48591B8F42BA050E274CEAFD3734
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
0x1B440E14BFCCF279CB35E50B2BFE6120

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A mere spectre!"
0x5C8CFC05B899B5AE95C49FECABD92C1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is she ill, or only famished?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
0xABD1BC0791FFA2C5FDB14C5D1693D91F
bread."
0x414B3B53414B3B53B08AD3B07139F3B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
0x8B8464B8721543078956C6154EB9AF82
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
0x93EAB709F7920CF3BE219C501C7BB728
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
0xFFE770CC1736AECC226C8C7A5B2CF9E2
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
0xC7A283B44D5B4175B7D73250F5B592C3
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
0xB13623F66EB455336EE731C7248F316C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
0xD021362B63D6202A337E7DBE076A3CF0
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
0x9EAA1940D8D0ADAA813B0BC3325B821C
first, eagerly soon.
0x7A1593BA10DE30C5C25F104904A860F0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
0x0880E98D3539D5ED1FB67E713DA0F668
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
0x1BA9F76F5EC23C4236973C48CAC4EC7B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
0x7C04983A273CAB501E335C63CBE81167

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
0x2BE063FBFAFAA8FDE90374530B15CA05
name."
0x9D49B0739D49B073079C0B76500D2FAB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
0x4803F67DB62B79179ED7F3407FA645E3
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
0x63DAB39CFF7E5867BC53C8588F087DDC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
0x611AB52424A03A5B4CD67199845872A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was silent.
0xA5F12A19A803F945843F2F98903B50AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can we send for any one you know?"
0x694F9688B6642DAF0624BC64FC0DC8BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shook my head.
0xAFA9698CAC9F7EFBD616B61A25D3513D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What account can you give of yourself?"
0x8FFB71FE989CFFB1FB0FAF24B69B0073

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
0xF51C5DCD73BF8E1EC84F339516DD6212
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
0x5F94FBFD7B17F9CE923C0571B80D0944
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
0xF32D6EEB7D2FEABDE0D5B37610BDC5C0
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
0xDA0F0E7C1C9B009796585FAB797E8238
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
0x8AD39601D749477DBE8209B795661B8C
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
0x655D1909EA8352A561DFAA1364E7D690

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
0x48522245762DA8EC50D94CA0E059134F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
0x089DB950F5373B67720D8172389E8FF8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
0xCAC2411D7373113B81B0E49F7B13E85E
took the word--
0xE3997BDB1CA7007F757420D62D00BF1F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
0x65435A380F7D999E7279A83654456490
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
0xF9A837A185ACC670CDD95E8DB8E302CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
0x3E1821F5345CF53A6C631E790A47145A
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
0x271571A080E5FE5AC959BF336D1A4DBF
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
0x6626FCC6F22CDD7D865C996D2B15651B
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
0x4468114A02744BFEC707AC94D2F196F8
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
0x29A2A4A3B27760DAB46A53B838503D70
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
0xC653B4207418672996C0B367AE85E39B
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
0x605AA1F946F00A6E32BAB128422ACD3F
silent.
0xE7DA0A75E7DA0A752582AA3F26FBE3E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
0xD5EF36860A8865267CA97E756FF8CED1
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
0x9D32B60B6CBE24202C13F91C6913E47C
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
0x61C9750BF6F70A682A781133DA64F4AB
matter over."
0x6CCBF4F034D39892CDBCB9149BD569EB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
0x40C93111E60E18FE09C532802D340833
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
0xCBCA7BA8ECD2CECB66A5B4B5B9268186
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
0x3F333143AE359943FC8E3D3C24DC4970
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
0xE7E6B2C674744DD8050878A3DAD00425
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
0xD75E7B64A8638423D65886E9EE4D985C
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
0xD0C49FAD9BA7119CCB8A8522243EB808
joy--and slept.

CHAPTER XXIX
0x537D8758BF8823EF0FA8749F4457E347

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
0x285D7ED2051DDB1B1868A70C310FC70A
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
0x5A262399ED8FC61FCC0C3DEE8798E08E
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
0x632D57CFCE3890413EFDCB65989A29AB
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
0xAE433477C6B5A8DDF75F39B1797A11F4
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
0x4F9E7CCE20643404A7FACFD173AF209E
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
0x0B75096AAEDABE067887A05252FF2416
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
0x0129F63C3FC7629D3B32F9F2C370DC63
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
0xEDA3A1E250029D42C1EC1D72D4303E18
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
0x1A63CD63BC22CC2335F846A0D158F847
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
0x4DDA41167B1EA7E1FABEF289A78D693B
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
0x206D6B2BEB5801559FB884085B18A369
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
0xA5B887A4D23568E25816DB1C1B86AB0A
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
0xAA7D610B42288445E9EB3A863486FC7D
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
0x384C3520B9DB26F186CF649F7681CCB2
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
0x2FEEE9BACCEB2FBF870D7718BC4B0B6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is very well we took her in."
0x1034A068B9D08A06C9FC382A5870D65B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
0x30E0B69E21B11A3BED9A523D43FABD84
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
0x7F2D1FAE3C17B8424A908A84E680419F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
0x5C7EBF8B3FE939D67270E4080459F62F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
0x87131E57EDF7E6469BCDA5E04D735F64
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
0xD1457E620C427F4FE755B826B67AA246
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
0xE9D98856BAA0D4765F1F1AAB87BD85D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
0xBD6403C4DDF10BD336B6F7CE53B69C52
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
0x7ACF3EC1B30096E0C8CD68F2EE361227
would be agreeable."
0x6D2F81CCB004BBFCAD701FA9754AC91F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
0x3F777731C5018F7E98AD65A99EBAA138
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
0xB3D48EFA90FFBF09E44F7927E90D9F8E
myself.  I was comforted.
0x1FC00B8B3016BD7A9506D6EDBBDCE74B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
0x24C1D27A06A36F903A888AD3E060D81D
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
0xE175C4AF9EE29B389C715591EEAC2E57
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
0xC9F75F4455C3CBDF41A86DEFA6E7B4E3
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
0xABBC959C03FA85EAE2504934EBBF9B73
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
0x9F213A5DE850C1B235C646419878C1ED
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
0xEDF10818516064C0602C27BA1D44ACF9
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
0x4BAAE5E5BB54C826D6A051577DCDD949
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
0xA23382BEA5DBD190133FA44E7A16FCDF
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
0xB0B797B63C1088E581DCFE662657B8C3
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
0x9AEF00EB4C367B83EE51342E43B31147

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
0x51D8C07DA51F13FFE7EA871C87BAD63D
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
0xB25811ED7C11F1F9B50F2044938CFE54
her permanently."
0x39C2AF4310BFC069F6353A760D8BDB32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
0x05C30DC74425563934B24E61E5FBF5A7
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
0xFEE1E938E5000C2F4CABCB35B091E5A6
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
0x5D3124D2229C14D670918AFF3694C487
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
0x8E8328ADB21963FCBCB93E38360538A3
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
0xEFBCBAD2479EB743AC7791968D20F144
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
0x9681F085E31E1E5133604A3D8215CCB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She is so ill, St. John."
0x95BE501B0FCA5D304DB81397CC8FE7FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
0xC33E47CB3943D69DF21EA63C9B191215
are quite wanting in those features."
0x2B24929D461B435DC86361FD6712AA93

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
0xFB69CA5AE53FC72B8FC921C64782C7C3
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
0xE5A233F82AE5AAB4D897833879D43E5C
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
0x38E819578550F6633D0F5089A90E34F0
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
0x2C17CEEF1BB1F8EB7FF245EA43C031DB
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
0x85EBF5A0ED4C548C3F1C07CA6C9DD61D
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
0x9520B045AE255D947783C3684396EFCF
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
0x49AB785DC08B76C58FA063C367E57CEC
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
0x9D1A93F569602517D8C4660D56F3BC55
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
0x10AC54487B7AECDAF0ACA06A0C8593F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
0xB88B515B59B212A36E3A804C443780EC
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
0xD93A334735BFA54CFD5070084CB41EBA
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
0x47C0ADD365E64EBAD46AC8985D2BC8F3
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
0xEFBA483A61A283ADBCF26EA95B0EC086
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
0xEADF4DD988B06B4AA7061C5A425BFB70
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
0x0A6851D84683CFBB9E2BCF9FA31F58E4
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
0x21D67E05C73350192F09C9A140865AE1
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
0x0D9AC588ECD7F4F9624A80000D89BDF5
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
0x59DB9C8273243F965B72D55D7D906DED
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
0x0A1DA79344E55C3EB48F23D93953F927
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
0x0FA545E43CECD720720A0CA84A4329A7
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
0xD644F8F193BFF3E5D6278E1D6AE493FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
0x7B8F8522DD4D6838600E0F0AD5EF70CC
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
0x19A1D53444FD9BB3B0E13E0BE8B9A41D
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
0x77DB50289D4DD153698B5BB5CAE6E8D4
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
0x237D4E9E9D25A8CA072DA2A1F3C64A77
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
0xBC21EC0D452E7E07D40F74AC7F886882
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
0x1F9EA82F7327FC220A85A105C0BE7C30
well-dressed, she even smiled.
0x657AE50D3D29F83E9A7B05844910347A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
0xCE12A2D092DBF928EF92522954D34DD8
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
0xF025BBF6BE0F5497922EF32C1D43F2E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
0x3B88FB3324A14B9E21DEB2C42E3FA96A
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
0x0FC0769EF91AEE307EB8214702BECC5D
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
0xBE8F7685F092080F4CC3933163930C5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
0x86C02A5DB855BA015760A7AD3D99D6A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
0x573062E2FAFC69FBE51FF46E09012DD4
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
0x9F43CCC01D1CDCDD270DDCAA925057A7
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
0xDE6E0181EFD0980EE58C41310685B7DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
0x9FED0CD8CA121AA7FA99FC3A6D99BBF9
than yourself or your young ladies."
0xCDE674DE1DF3D4E161ACA3DC92EC06F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
0xC1A7B297D0E6AE2876B8C26BD33767C9
nor no brass, I guess?"
0x725683B6B3BD73C2EF2E54716DECFB52

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
0xAC3C2315FCE01AA7CD3B57F48BEF7C9E
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
0x8389DAB205A481B98AF6BE45E8F68D03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
0xD1E8251E39CB08EE47FBE3C904669014

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, very."
0x0EE50676B19054C51271525524C56A68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
0xFFBEF12FADEB97F734C5E5509D4FC24B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
0x2E691470464C5BFB9E02B43D4C6F84A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
0x3F19F6FA2A6CEB34FA118E750C856D43

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
0x1DC0DFFAD9578520028E390B90EF6C59
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
0x78DE0A15A1602DCBEB2AE7C84DD1D12F
basket of the fruit.
0x6AEC5C4CE81C7F14B383A430BF373940

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mak' 'em into pies."
0x5C1BCF8441269365C4B88E4616FAE8FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
0x6B2AECC114E513E2B7489C7DDCD63EEC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
0x765D03B48143387050232455606DC9DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
0x51DAA31DC479299A4D7912BFB33368AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
0x4D7AC4B00C9C9600F4E9EEAAA275037A
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
0x00FB02D69CBD51D31AB0CF153C79B3C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
0xF709AF6D2E186DA99FD103FF4BD95B8D
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
0x7F751E72CEDE3526AAA820669E134FE2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
0xFCD0EB45D6D6D366179CB35D33D71497
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
0x76AC215BF4688999395B0D3895EC87EC
are."
0xFA4E7056FA4E705654273EC1504A2173

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
0x1F52E0788126157659731F9A0542959C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
0xE70730E62145B7F164809812D134922F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
0xF88D11B1802F515477AAC9BD6CAF8F10
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
0x3BFE39BFBBB0FB60165D81B6111FE49F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That village a few miles off?
0x4A6D81DE05AB6ECFE8D3B19DE9AD32B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Aye."
0x54B5537A54B5537A0D17A8BA47929B8B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what is he?"
0xE66F3AF7138F2ED38FF2142CA738AE56

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He is a parson."
0x09FB9D82198D820B4EB4805BA5A424FB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
0x051E27C9962F7C9F39933B434E0DF286
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
0x6008425F55B1D6D748155C931C4C6FEA
residence?"
0x8B31530420991F4E0C0B599C21B421F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
0x13924F239D2B6893E7B344EAAFC5250C
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
0x209646FBB0E4922D006251E553F1E7A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
0x0ABE369207F60751E4E443DDD766A6FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
0x04BA887782A253ACE674CDB2E27AE84A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
0xA39E7F06BD2D2840A18434C29EE7AF92

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Their father is dead?"
0xB66762C5C07D635DB31090945E5EC256

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
0xB784F2F0ABC1160053583C978DA69E36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They have no mother?"
0x8AB6515B8CB17B18404DEB6B206548B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
0x290D11FC83DFD163AE7AB1C5DAC5A416

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you lived with the family long?"
0x47F99E245F68AF99870C30225056FDD1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
0xE00629E3201EDCC79C9DF64032374174

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
0x2EA438714618CDFAE0BFF508CED14382
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
0x9813908FA6267AA37BE4AF0466B01787
beggar."
0xF5AB1D396BB280A445058C2AF59F496D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
0xC8E167164FE3EF7170F8F36B7FB7D5A6
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
0x8A41D7BD66ED83AF5F454CC25AA18E89

0x03BEEBAEF3879F746AC7593C927500B7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
0x86A8CBD1452837EC7A852E6A8A20CC23
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
0x431147809CB0DFDD9187DDAA7466FF03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'

0x7640A4416C066AC38EDF9D07B2EDCD61
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
0xD7340432C1CC9DADDD555C1952D076AA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
0x81FDB67A730C9255F98EF6ADCC7932E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
0xB65F81FF7780DADCED43282FB1E4E64A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
0xB440C7AB4908DEA0489D4890167A308E
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
0xF30DA646CE862097DDFB438A70BD0FDB
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
0x1C9810ED3B3DC0C40728DE055A16CF9D
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
0x059E5ABA6345E2C5E686BA32DC7D55F0
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
0xCD7B1DE08535D3DE92EA9074BC456816
to consider poverty a crime."
0x35B6935B9C2EFF91C0790A18DBC15F6D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
0xB3D4523FC0D71503776F7FDECE6F546E
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
0x34C6C6FB7FA56F8470C1365D971C6238
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
0x72F57D29464E15D3B37DF975F89213A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
0x1F777890BFE6D2D9E4656655D89876AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
0x7A65D0E62A5DAF1C4B645FAE209EB322
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
0xCC75391B060CBDBD264DA4F5917F4849

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
0x432EA771819FBE53893A937868B58E30
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
0xF7D82A851D6F228E17E1E380E74B12F8
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
0xEEFAC42AAF70AC7FF4213408007A4569
the young people.
0xA7F30BB75F041324E0693CBA84BEDDA8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
0x967F3A84A56CF57E7F3A6CA969EB9E86
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
0x97AB19B66EDD8E933FE2639A8BE17E51
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
0x9E5749604091DDB1A4CA17A9A7301DC4
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
0x14E01766B341EECA90FAE15769AE4F4C
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
0x9E6829F6C7B0252DE620D934FB23E9AC
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
0xCA6A6A2A9E5808A8407CC3E9162F44F0
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
0x3A185BEAD89290CC0092B9D887023857
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
0x667DF3B7C9AFFE837DBB0E119ECC3A41
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
0x8C9C44F5C43A2C55F7F3B736D2FC270A
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
0x2337AD2EBA4EEA214B95B016E55A1F5F
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
0xA59E829B0BFF4A8F2D42F20CCB18DA88
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
0xBC983DC4E3B21068F4B17DF4E641EA1D
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
0x2532A1B0FA213867B6093F4D904AEF18
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
0x47E6ABD2466E64F8AA12EAE658D6716C
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
0x499B8175FAC1097162EC4B5A8E73F64F
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
0xDC3115AE7B074A7DDD5A2443C9073847
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
0xC445C7440D46B6DDB2C9814A05AB11FC
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
0xFE822CE0CAD88CA5F8836FA857B1F05C
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
0x802E60DE5C93A0FE41224524839618A0
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
0x917CF93C268D0406B8C25D25599BC2D9
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
0x1B05D7AA6C09E102512CD0D4D8AC25C4
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
0x91CC223F452BC9F586DE3531C4192E90
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
0x76F4514056834CA4BD2547B284E40AF9
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
0x51D64D43DAF7974EE8AF34ED61C56A6B
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
0xAE1438966970FBCFE70099450232A705
for being united.
0x196180034D7F735BD7984D7965300233

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
0xE02002C2A4AB21559B628C7702E77439
ladies and their brother were now.
0xC7927F20854C6A3E22DE26AD83044A46

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
0x7346BAB8CF8A5B34C6D43A6BF81972D9
to tea."
0x756AD12A49774DBB4AF615ABBBBE7F39

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
0x8499E5D1C5756F6C95D5EA169C41AC6B
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
0x48BC043990C127780BCE501004440F49
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
0x4E7087A596467F3537D6C34D28708540
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
0xF0242E81554054CF5525A4119755726B
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
0xA532BF6F16A80284E7A1417CD205267A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
0x5C60768FDC09C98022E0F93217386A3D
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
0x7A9259C540EF258B12C067BE57F23092

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
0x44D2C2B829012B4CF8CD0BE1228CCE99
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
0x742067880E0CF6492A186E5CB1EE4E3A
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
0x1E737B612EB88BC3C5C6E2B9D93E0567
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
0x43FA122F17D15C597DF409533EC8B61F
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
0x34454B0851EBF3CE8F0797A45392DDE5
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
0xD16C0A0E8D4E4F6801529BA8D8FCAFDA
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
0x3DEC33C0B83911B1612C29B488A42923
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
0xFC8C5D393F3554C4596E488EEAD5F6E6
will.
0xD57311F6D57311F6D86008748B7DDF84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
0xF274A96FF33C7C63342EEEE19F7628F1
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
0xE21FBF1397E348E5F97286B34873D9DB
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
0x948FC009ACB674B34039807D57B16EE4
parlour."
0xB41A362C3DEEB2F12D9771C4E36474D3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am very well here."
0xC78D90A9047EC3A8EE602905028346B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
0x41AAB53C4E4A8891E87E9C21C6C3E92B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
0xA98E83483B6A60E9E92ACF7AFF811A5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
0x94A9763080CC5DB7F18BCDC72E059F20
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
0xBCAAB3AE93E52BA625C4687EDFDEA815

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
0x8845B00D7427E72FB418CC26123FDC6E
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
0x704A0ED13D12FF28D917949C82575813
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
0x3CFF0A3A857AFB3A51A139C760D93694
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
0xCD1EC99A2004F1D48BD2209A269EF785

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
0x4B0305A71597AD68D3D96AC306B17315
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
0x00CDFE537115609F527F824C0B954C23
parlour, and then its occupant.
0x1E7E8F8D6C7F0012991E58F961C56C7D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
0x653058025DC2770E646CE6235CFE2645
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
0x04534855F6A3D473FB18E8AE3D505D7D
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
0xD7D98183F9FA5F34303BDB92AB68A80E
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
0xBF247F9471ECC789F8947B67B16ADBA3
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
0x18E0EE22094F118C75DB6E867C8A95C3
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
0x0F29ED90EEC956AB6196836D8938580B
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
0x3AB1C7D3CF1ED0116EB4C7F0E706431D
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
0x8EC459D55BC82E9D6E49B9B3B1A701BC
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
0x402B453DA0D36DD8E15CC582ECC1D043
and well saved.
0x0F319B73E02FC504BB6968EF41C344A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
0xED0CCE43577F5AD025E816EED3891DF6
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
0xE8D329B9A34F3885811111C9C09001D8
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
0x3EBB46A17E7CEABE491948864FCBC744
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
0x8CED3A346114162AAAE117A466FBCACD
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
0xA9A0EF67EB1E13D01CEAED9239CCDC85
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
0x7A888A6A98F9BBC0B79696BEC497908C
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
0xB81BFBFEDC7AD6A510E4E52FEB4E0602
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
0x80C3D2E2CC4974F1C4A4CB3E7876123F
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
0x8F4F30413AE7AD5DFA96C407A9EBD24A
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
0x29A5B2854C32DF123F9288284239F96B
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
0xE4964C4B59D9812652A613F0DC99C9FC
fair hair.
0x0445A688B752C1403E9CD41F9E1D8C0B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
0x0AD6ED0F81171E1D427496BC959F6DDC
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
0xFFB573913D89F9305AB673A09A8269BA
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
0xF0678EE06038B170C6BF1E5F3C2628B0
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
0xF024A08191C5EE0BAD6ABFABC96855CE
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
0xE0559A55343CBE492D5330E7035888F0
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
0xEDDE91882046315C30CBD24EBA10D4BA
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
0x11B01D8D8EFB80645A592D0169BE82A8
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
0xB5E0EEE194016AA6F8825AC17D616F89
of the oven.
0x9AF0A4D81D9F2A362CFE66FB4F6BCA64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
0x83D08A040B8F8F37AB68427EF85AEEE8
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
0x9A8E310C446408A9774E3906F1CC71A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
0xECBAF9265E94F83C099DDAEDE5C55765
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
0xB905CDA73C567FB87E0C35D8B5237C59
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
0x4053388789ED1D8BDC1BBDC5A88B2484
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
0x794F924FC9B8E9ECF64541795264D72E
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
0x16713AD9434317EFE8FC7FDD61430A69
from the stranger.
0x8CC90FFB4EAFC38949D97CA5E5528284

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are very hungry," he said.
0x4AF771513729CC301262B58CF1BE4C3E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
0x2B7CBF988B4FB8B18DC832EC07C170A6
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
0xD563BDFFD2B2BA216C69536A1212F48E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
0xAE92BD2FA4B331F52B437039F98BFB3A
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
0xDF1029C6F902E7A22480F0F1B5408738
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
0x3DD34DFD163862BD09768EF6EE52985D
immoderately."
0xD88DD376795AEEF1BF2352ED77CA9A48

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
0x525B6771A0AAD87C0E09330137F0EDD5
contrived, unpolished answer.
0xAB4203A9B0E3A2A7025BE34B0DC7F60F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
0xA8EE962D4259B03AC22EF086C85F51FF
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
0xCD768AE34087AE180B0C3B51F036932D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
0xC7E1A76285C9A98690A15246E280EE67
absolutely without home and friends."
0x3B5C8C2B0E46A18CF18E3B6CC4FDB587

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
0xDD12C2609BCFA599AD4FC270275394F8
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
0x6EBC9EAA21E4AD9BAAE725EA06B8009B
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
0xD9FC9AA0106A50C3C0FB0EDF8B3EDA26
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
0x138AB01C6D33B687F9AFFBCF417F1091
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
0xE074F4898F666108EB5C6426A3336B56
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
0x8397116D0C49E0B9AD0BD012B093875E
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
0x7F3FBF3C0F062068A7469DD9A21C7D0B
to encourage.
0xD5BC069502490FCD5F242F246A62AA2E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
0xDAA7AD98681AF3F259F71362D0B925AB
every connection?"
0x23A9E994EBF7237C138B27FB5058F0B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
0x0423A1BF0C3CCA4724D510E501C407EE
to admittance under any roof in England."
0x2751C70CCD595990B30D462282CAA30C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A most singular position at your age!"
0x85B4A1B1C1D9E2C0CDBC6EE83E2A48CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
0x5871211EA7D195D828EB3086AB0E99F4
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
0xE1E322BA4DCBE2B483E63B69D4902AED
explained the quest.
0x5E6E634F2A3007213CEDF4D2C00781E9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
0x55AC36E77D84867B37F085CC7424CCDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
0xFBF9A754A3E8CCC529EFCB33ABBB5D25
St. John," said she.
0x0A05DB5E9BC95B7ACF607A448F342986

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
0xC619DBB5AE4A353CAF5C9D6CE5E39816

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
0x6ACF8C568F092B2C9D2BA9A715A0AF9D
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
0x164A085E8BDC60FBAA7EBD8EED4F02D9
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
0x73CD9CF5F6234F2E544D5A5FC9A5EAC5
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
0xCBDAB18E9222D2E117554E3F729EBF77
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
0x7D2AC5A7C036D40AECC00F18DF4C0125
out tears as well as colour.
0xD8F0234C090736302D084504C5CEA774

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
0x6F3C23C12746DF41CAB9D90D956BF139

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
0x3543AFA77B58AA127C33E850F214DF28
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
0x12723088CCDFBC5736B6DA4D316C08F5
piercing look.
0x9EDD38AEB0A24BCFD91274ECD7E89556

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
0x1BD4931D4F7DA310171BF2999B94ECAB
secret," I replied concisely.
0xAB49521605210A50F1505925D1392AD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
0x2BD1BBC68753373ED711AD4E5A49B177
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
0x9B7FB17A123289DD998B86402EAD56DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
0x44E68454E81DD8E02E78191B8BD6CDD8
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
0x39A40D7165D902F849002A7F830ABE5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
0x10E28E26515C8CAF430C63C4DD014958
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
0x1BC62450F13098FA620D8E8B7FDEB606
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
0xAAA2862B4BC6FFA93E6971A1BC285B6A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
0xD3FB2140DD23FA4C8B6F4E89ABDB08F9
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
0xCA5D4CF2DB44FCDC7201D5F888B013FB
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
0xA299B489E13C59C6AAC58015B0AA7E9B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
0x7D021341097FCBB3485C7E19440A265F
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
0xCF8B9CD198780EACFDBFD51811CADBF7
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
0x4A33EE5CEA463E7082963B822B4598D7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
0x7F5F553BAD7A7BC0C1153F44D1E49CCA
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
0x67429404F882531DE592D05CF255CEE9
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
0x629DE46C8767D06A7788D09FDEBCFA27
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
0xF8BD6055707059F9F0B7DAFD838E6420
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
0x2A1EFD9891B32E2F0D74857821E71872
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
0xBB2528DF79485BD26782D1444DB40FD5
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
0x5E44404E8A3748530328C6CAF13DBC55
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
0xABF1C075BDF745890489861102AA8C32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
0x7C71FF5BC144E52A0537C776B58652A9
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
0x521E4DCAC19F69CEA2F8CFE8377D802D
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
0x3D1DED779E9A15A233945207D29C3AE6

and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
0x88BFCA231A86206AF828C35FF98FC8E7
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
0xE0BE8B03F2E7C328CF358E52B3680D9A
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
0x9CC58CCE84DAE858C77751A551490812
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
0x2384A4FF2A91876EEAF204FAF37810FA
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
0x2B72A9A7B8629E67BBEC9F7D97304D5C
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
0x989583ABACCCFC79FEAACB8FC8C4FAAF
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
0xAC9560CBF393F651F1419A2A023D8B28
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
0x532BE4B687BBCB6BCDC211912D5549B7
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
0x3A5B0FA5EAEBAA79E04D37596999C7BB
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
0xBD276495130416EF9304EBAA80930244
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
0x2A22F1824D153A2D249EC797E907FD57
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
0xA975E24100E58FF29FB94D084057F13D
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
0xA3F77B56E9A6B20B13EEB28D8E6775C0
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
0xE101EA7DD1AAB8AE951372E9FC5B64F8
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
0xAED83892DB7CC9A69104F356AE27DCCF
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
0xDEE6B0F0CD5B12C4749DAEA6EC789A4B
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
0x5FFC222774938EB1B98761D22D639AAE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
0xA6C33662595A059CB82E77BBCE2C75EB
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
0x287F082F2E3CD4408BFEAABC5029B4C1
down now, Miss Elliott."
0xB09ABE62E0395E371E6DFFB562527A5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
0x7DC04DDE3E4C0606582CBC00E49D0DF4
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
0x9732968BF033AA20E04D9C7AA143677C
once.
0x239C958C239C958CFDB4A5C5AB018F26

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
0xE3655F5F624C716B4B14BC41D6F8FAE7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
0x251CD2F4FE1409EC9F6EBA5820DCED88
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
0x0723420AF671B92B302C41A8EE62D813
sounds strange to me."
0xCEB9AACCA07242879EF112C17C5E61C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your real name you will not give?"
0x35A2C6EBF9A66A5B4452DA1D48B7AAAE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
0x086AD7B17E9FA72CD69D2FDB154790F2
lead to it, I avoid."
0x17B7CAAF7AD31CB5D696E719957A3AD3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
0x7F3E19F2EE431DEDD0C395EAC9ECD8F0
be at peace a while."
0x41C5D33862D3617694B5E5ED6559E6FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
0x18547ABC82E2E92090AA440D20AD96EA
and with as much acumen as ever.
0xD708D6651FE19EEF17225A09F76CDAF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
0x347CBC18918EB5CB3D98D99C51E8D88F
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
0x945B8D66A73399AF54D647899E6F8534
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
0x85FE639DBEB48D48DE4F1FCBCCFBA53B
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
0x2E126EB5039F732F97B774D435A90D75
us?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
0xA8D6DF56366A29ADE058FD27EC98B2EA
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
0xBF03A9126AEF67189945832A55CA2980
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
0x92E6831089BAE9DA0490BDBB4F7EFF3C
the horrors of homeless destitution."
0xB25C99E12E065C372BD1C2ACF2380D57

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
0xB1A34465C786B00EB4987A6528551073
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
0x75F0AD2BC09704A5A69770AE51D11ADD
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
0xBAAE58B86B8A86925A097D34C7426F7F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
0x7DF7E67AC69ECDF57319757CC6E4883A
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
0xA25DA65003E436DA9A4A80CE37988EB3
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
0x5D266C673042E24EEBEFC3A950009E11
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
0x1A334D69AB5F464CFAB3C1412BF62476
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
0xF35AB9C125211193B2D5DCC03B9DD31C
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
0x29C2CA24C3894D609FCA73C314918393
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
0x6A48501E752C512A52139B413786FF29
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
0x9B6316C4676D3AA4A29DCCF02879CD1E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
0x83B0AB1E83ADE3BBE023078FBF5B2208
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
0x1069F86D2F91E74D23F2AAC195134CED
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
0x97B88B39D1EA9B7A578EB436CBB53C67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
0xAA79C8F6EF0A043F4306764853EF9EF7
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
0x9B6E2B93EA4B1B46CFCB180B9CFECB2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
0x83C0100D948EFA8CDCB50E157820C19F
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
0x965B6C74313028D4457BEFFE82B8983B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
0xDE6622FDBBF09F6982558A54DD7683FE
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
0x2ADE96094D9B21381E106D4F82EB82B3
present strength would permit.

CHAPTER XXX
0x0D2CBE71AD0643D8274C2A6CE9CC3CD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
0xA09F6572DC3A20C20FEA8924C97BDFF3
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
0x29563621403ADAF5ACF36FB6E8AC1F38
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
0x740091AE8D921E0F18099983A0A8C6C3
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
0x12F3574B2728E60A2AD7E25FE6582677
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
0x19006BD152D31E167732ED48343B1005
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
0xAB472FF5BA932395CD87E0FC9C966754
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
0x983CE17935EBDD7EF1B8D58FD327F37F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
0x9EA45F39DAE0AA7B0413F2A4F92A4E1B
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
0x2D28F2A6C979659B2C1460EB9C015B40
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
0xAF107DD882163061354F66188BD9CE92
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
0x936BB2BB53487CDFD77B3280012E2F75
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
0x8E81EDE67984E0A0B86BC643C4F803B0
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
0xCB7C0E64FCA1BCF715BEA2F805B59CCC
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
0xA06D375C456E821F0D2A08647BB0ECB1
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
0x6939BD9F2FA3AC06F41E5DFD770A8B19
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
0x1CCC3F81FD35DB853AE1B42F7A19233F
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
0x72A065E82908273EBD7724DA986EF90B
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
0xCE0B486DBE04EF2C38FD99DCC6EDC813
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
0xB9A10632E69B67A7F5ED5A7D15760187
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
0xBDCF1BA2E98094462CE4761D581293A6
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
0x46D4C89171B8583D1B296E6A39DCBB9B
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
0x2C9ED2E131418E2B63FBBA9DE3AD31D6
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
0x532579B39F0D49587746EF28960558B5
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
0x0329E93CF9E84BC453E62BC79794D50F
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
0xA8BD0D91CFB65189BA31DF8538F616EC
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
0x8373DCF003AFE6CADEF97DC4077D55FA
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
0xC9FF02E0AC5458DBEEFA06628D2045EB
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
0xC636E06CB9971AF271430940C0455706
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
0x7B62B32E9DE1EBBCD518A0E8D2EB5C84
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
0xD7E0360C1AB2F68A8CF9BFE6446979CF
that entranced theirs.
0x9727B885504EB4C2547EA9180899D1CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
0x1DD9E3304F11E7E73C88E29DC69F9B48
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
0xA15C7C0D0769AA8AEBE4279F65B283FB
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
0x9C61154C2B25F5551C8CD93813DB3A90
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
0xD7688A75996F44126B0EA2C0BAA94481
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
0x099F31F10F4A008F587B57592D75B185
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
0x72584CBFDC777E2F64214FE81CCB20BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
0x7595C704F18F1B4758059C691FC09729
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
0xCA4FE5236A3A7011B0D2FF1694939D2E
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
0xC31B0AA7B177E0FB4995B4A3F1A9F1C2
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
0xF02223E4F9E5D149E89F4946910B7950
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
0xC8B854FFD05DC94C0E65478AB92CAAA9
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
0xD38A2D0E361FB1A5FF556E1D86A11367
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
0xEF4B736BA4878B36E8B9CAA5AED4F9FF
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
0xC84CE1BBB4D55EA0C7CBC9533DABE9F1
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
0x5EEEF92E77995F03A6D3AE7305EAD2E9
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
0x5D1D28FE28857BC066F71AC85158D7DD
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
0x70931A18F6E13DA6FC31863E7AC665C2
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
0x634990D0DCE01D6BE0772141F9C7DB30
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
0x740D3D53C432E0CE7E2DB7EE9DB649B1
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
0x03232039092113F92DAF1691BC1141CC
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
0x37D0ED427243829AB02354DFA7CF0427
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
0xF8382852A3F1D189C8089FBD9E1F9EBC
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
0x46DE9F2EB4198EF3F6C3292D91DE0FD5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
0x38923E73802C6331B1DEFAE7820CC6E4
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
0x0A45F259D5B529D24B040EC858BBF75F
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
0x003EA17A9F3BE6340DE329D5C664D7B6
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
0xDF98E77E3A9C66F4E9517432281DCFF8
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
0x6CFD3DEF31B3E1804F2C8795AA283461

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
0x900990DD30D74029DDB6C0328DDAC960
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
0x825E30B56610789ACB24116F30F02560
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
0x6CFB40F60B43B07B731A701B279E5120
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
0x5A6285D54A764C7EA6D785C8128D119C
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
0x6F34FD832876198FA080CE5AAE1C44C7
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
0xF60AF080111AFE2C15C11E31AC947667
cheerful--
0x3CC4960EC8D5637B0C21DF20EADC7786

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
0x7CC8238AAA3718D3DACF540955E29DFC
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
0xEC9DA08753992EA4C4BD4C4890CC468B
propose to myself?"
0xB82B4F6DA04AE78D393AE95AD518B2C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
0x96ABDF3988BE7ECB3D011762F86A2E9E
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
0xAD5DA753295440BD31C86DD620F20462

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
0xC6B93D3A97E984F0653191584AC67D55
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
0xAB697798C63BF7EDB4CF4452DC52D821
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
0xB54BD86330EC67CC631540A16745821C
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
0xA637A0AFA12CCC7DD97651E8EA6C1AB1
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
0x9BCD5DAE63F379F3FB9F7B5693E57B1A
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
0x17814F8BD4059DCCEC35A68FF535AEA9
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
0x27228408BFBD7E9DE916666EE50694BE
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
0x15E95A0C6C0FF6235B4819F253453285
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
0xA608F8AE06E91919F051AE882A4813DA
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
0x2962B36D0B9A2FE08605F4FE8F3BA9A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
0xE93FBB237A5DAA34A0CAC1C91C881594
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
0x75E51169252EC8BEB50072CDEF0E6D69
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
0x17B92D325B128BF2F5061F9CD6552839
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
0x96972B481115FA3D1C12FA17907F2143
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
0xC983703A6525EF3B235549051A7E6408
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
0x455C9865DE36BD8DB30EFCCE185CF46B
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
0x1BF5672A237B22A5CC3A834CCDEE862E
delights they could yield.
0xE8173A9FAC359BEBF5E51FDF719E4E87

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
0x59AA870C9AB84FF8944628FD336AE909
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
0x0B4C766327BBB6973FA272DD24BC58ED
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
0xEAFD5F717A0DEC5445024ABD464170D7
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
0xE96CB5823B9FB30ECE3C0210602F7132
produced on me.
0x163C5428F6A72ACDE8EFA0DE903E823E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
0x5697E4281605C739C4190AFE98C47ACA
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
0x5BF61F124ACE3AEBE029C63C2676D770
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
0x793B2D02167E14A9501B839F8F3D8685
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
0x6631A1948420FDC506C1F27666EEEFF1
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
0x52584F8E6F4735C7DC10CEEAE3934D11
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
0x18E2115E94084429DD71579D73FB85C2
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
0xCF6AC3B7C27E70A790D1DDCB2202D8A8
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
0x58DC404ADC6942C554A28CE583374F94
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
0xDB1BC0DE5AD2E669704BF952EAACCE06
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
0x5B3E73C295992DAA0DC4086433C69295
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
0xB10D8FA5E20C3E6FE71D4130DE737F45
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
0xB8A8126A044F7FEF2FD82BF61FB00890
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
0x6C8711F1B81F9F0E94CC4010B4E94A5D
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
0x12345FA8A8C5A768FE81439C7201089A
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
0x22EBB6B7D5C0AB34FA2EE8C3219AC737
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
0x54EDE28AC7CE3A09AC2B37FEA48BD568
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
0x5A728595FDE755E8B3FB16C697AA9CE8
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
0x53796934A42CEDE7DC208B8F7BE29CDB
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
0xBFAAFFE6AF58A4E100E90D95217D125B
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
0xAA2497E9F1A42E8DD180E24E1E017349

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
0x042331FE6D462F20DD833F4449AF9E52
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
0x4A21A03A49D7D957624AC668614B3B7D
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
0xE4C4E734B0F06FAD07084DAA14A9D955
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
0xD0BC6EFAEA8D366BA30B96A46D7A091E
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
0x77A773023EDC5FC5E158341EFE543BF8
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
0x4732A7BAD48A9102893BD2D76B2E3644
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
0x59192C1143A4EB9CA142502943FF65AE
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
0x304243D2CC241E811633B742172BB41E
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
0xF1885D722A111714D0D8D7D64B532E21
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
0xD379D7AC80DA5230C804441975FFE46C
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
0x84D0EB2CDB3E8CBE7AF26B08208D73EE
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
0x76CF22D0BC6EF3ED0B44CACC019EBBFA
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
0x86905732DC6C7994B59AD7E44E5EDA69
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
0xFCA67A302C7C656E48DF9E9578E963EA
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
0x22BCC73DAC74A4EB00FD16685E9E1E95
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
0x4B35674BEB4FF5CD0B6BB6A50A6A11CE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
0x4A53AB26B3C02523FFEFAD690EEF64AF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
0x3D3228D898DEBA49123428A38F6A1278
myself to undertake?"
0x0B99F51C4C986D2194E0950FA7C4F541

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
0x67E1F8DCF0F41E0005CF24B01F583661
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
0x6255F1C8D0053AF419175C4721FBFADE
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
0xD7877D3D222BBFAB6EA9AA85758132D0
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
0x73E94229858DED266B4F3717F6FAA9D7
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
0x9B4382F0FE8DFEEC30DB787485F1201B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
0xA68813448FB694D19B3BCE73694302F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
0x799DB84DF9B17D4D628F5070BE85C89E
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
0x35D2C482663C49A44A7DDF11DDE037D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
0x1F7ED0774719E7EB1F969B67C4A029C5
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
0x0295236556B3FE72739E13B79C5B2F74
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
0x371BE55049EE1C91B3123A452B1B13DD
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
0xEB1CE97FD0174707C24A674D861254B5
interest to me.
0x10D604D18B3C7732DE13D764D0920DBC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
0xB1D06015F692E67CE36FDE5A097641BB
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
0x18AC91C3D0D6BEE8AE6782E23402C9A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
0x1C989E9B0F273712A9F9A0CA36F17828
you to accept."
0xE2215E97B414F981753F8D30E5C1E885

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
0x9E87DFA3F927E5A517D1638AA8B31496
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
0xA51CA624CFB821598442D54DD1749C13
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
0x7FC9459436288D2AC4C612CE8AFF8EB7
could have done, and with less trouble.
0x442C2951AEC0B1D00FC56D3900684E63

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
0x6C96DEA6B1E2D6F3F23AA7FA3C6F2F1B
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
0xD3A0227892370E7B748C671E73AA3C2C
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
0xC77DD70331D56F819D15C466F1621557
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
0x9815F4F9BE9C4C6A8CACFDEFA9A2DADA
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
0x1BCD3FB33CAAB975C242475B7C00AF25
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
0xE8CFA1D77D2E161982928E1811917D0E
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
0xBFC7C6A4D1DDB4CC87B6750A29A70220
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
0x119C3A6281F3E401DCB72ECC14D30777
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
0xAA3FF5BB458A57121131F18ADF446FFC
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
0xD1DF265E7B6E32005BD07B5A92DEC66A
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
0x6F791F6916282E9612A227A093AE85ED
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
0x069B3CC30B0CC16F808510A755015B21
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
0x6CBCB142306844EF8AACD244E5FA29AD
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
0xD8A968931A70AB652D3C972CE8CDB669
'Rise, follow Me!'"
0x1FC776BEA184F6417CE9FDA0411B1CA3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
0x8169E57C4763FD3C1FAAC2C7A19CB512
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
0x530E98CB2437BEFDEB394AFE5A83EAFE
glance.  He resumed--
0xFEF5C4F173A6C515BA4D240238EBC86A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
0x32A2A8CBC224D8318DB08A1F6705C27C
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
0x4AEE7F3E0B3F23D0A4C9DBE46C3FA780
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
0x35257DB3993C86C7B23CF44324D38AFC
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
0x9A1ABE2FF17082BFA9B855C2D3DB5FD3
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
0xCC9C3CCA56E400B06864AA82F7EA5C0D
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
0x212ABAC6A43F28D25AAD033137F3A4DA
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
0x4F7337E891748DFF759C4C9957FEB818
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
0x892D51902BD964EBECD23A1F9D15CC0B
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
0x51ECC462E20568CF842607C5DFD3EB14
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
0xED32C81446455A204B9996E855565C86

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
0x4667C5039A4A7BB41E3B7BBE12F64381

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
0x2F157F9DADC171A78838A55BD3598F93
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
0x16AA48321E51856644810FA2775D8EFC
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
0xEE4B5B9EA74BD44700BD76665A3CB187
succeeding observations.
0x0074FF877688C560F7B2E81EC26A9F07

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
0xB374CED73FC5837D724A0C26B2079A43
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
0xBD24638572269993B99311DB1B5A8E45
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
0xD70EC031954F31DD57538D06680D9B4D
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
0x146DA271BEB1DB90028FE29CC9BE2125
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
0xE479979A7943DDDFDBDB7916C34F0689

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
0xC0B9AA77230BF2A5C8F5206097FC5994

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
0x13B3F76ED505364426302CCA9B5DC066
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
0x17D2C82E482CD4E87A81B0F76034AA16
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
0x31375E72897D1C82C761E9AA313A26B3
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
0xAA2E157AA5E25BDA6A02E1707FB9692F
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
0x88E5F87B4BE821740AFBB43ACA984891
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
0x657C42754202B11DF68DAB92144E97CC
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
0x0478006807D1B868DC995750EF80D12F
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
0x8DF69FCF3F8E3449EE47EB06260CE6AA
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
0x3FB08751D985252BEA9AC992BCCB6F03
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
0xEB1A4E51162C5C33BB8EE0BDB25260D3
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
0x1C8A6A02371E8B20F3FDCC050649502C
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
0xD00B84524ECE3EC73A504211061F523F
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
0x0F18F30A96690A7726FB2E5E34784F4D
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
0x0B4D9E491BBBB49DDB6A32287145399C
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
0x3FAAF5E62A109D972D6DCAA28455B0AA
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
0x984F898B4C8F4E8D600A620194739293
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
0x21219AD24B2857B7FEA563A0B8D8A7E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
0xAE0F2A57B50FD0738B79660661E155FF
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
0xA12942836036C065CBA32B6ECD510AC0
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
0x1754A4C26E981A5804674245A8688D4D
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
0x49D20F38EC2382D26D5A20E5DAA700E7
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
0xD595F36BA4AAABDE2E1B72EB9D128592
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
0x612F128037EB2C417837716C255690C0
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
0x6CCB2F99D1666DD2BCDAB6605AB32EC4
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
0x308E42FA8B5A81AA9051C4C93BC51DBE
decision.
0x9206EA5B53EC9008DF945B419CEADE22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my

heart."
0xB1BDFAAAB1BDFAAABAF9DFFC1B75E847

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
0xC2524C8E4DEF97B87EA18D46A8D60504
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
0x0FC9E634D12767FBC88788DB7DAB018C

you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
0xF813C428FA947F2A85E420365133CE22
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
0xF6D4C6B68A066DE8997A5FE90954747B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You know what you undertake, then?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I do."
0xB3560896B356089618896A464D08A8CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
0xCF75945609217228E04F7783C4916FE4
deeply gratified.
0x3066238F77DCA431D70A2D9F42B35A95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well: so be it."
0x785740A903686954BC17E216BD0D3108

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
0x58024A55DD608DA99774B717F0953B7B
me.  He shook his head.
0x4B7F30826694CD507C52CD58A83D9389

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
0xD7EA3CF383B44148DC906A3B9DFFAC4E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
0x99D27A5981F69186AB92B6AE7BFC7000

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
0x651510E456E44877C936A6D11C38F156

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
0x65AD1BAA607C4267CB713BDC3F54DCE1
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
0x3A7C51D85D533B459B2B63886E0B7BE7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am not ambitious."
0x476E326D5C2979BDDEDB3F4A0A5BE6A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
0x2FDCD2BB1AE2AD6E01B738900A9D1F6D
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
0x6A674BEE97F4359760DDE2345180809B
it out?"
0xAF88E3DC49C92D8DC75888F283E0F0F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was speaking of myself."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
0xFF0239A9977C007830E0886DEB27234A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What?"
0x5D934A975D934A979BBD95824E54AD28

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
0xC53E820FC571D397A843860673237896
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
0xF1C3DF6D670D424A3E9F676E75FAD129
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
0x327ACD0BA4556442C46899AAB3850030
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
0x831ECAB8B2F843F4FE85E9376135757F
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
0x69D8FE521B2B3407E6EFAEA143C4E490
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
0x52E10FA67CF78A1887C6EAAF81970BE2
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
0x08EA7AA146AF4A55B4146E97E607D4C4
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
0x19F3827496EB140AF7C00F5DC6561950
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
0xDC0C091DDD2F7590444C63C883EC17DC
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
0x64AB72838ED6F79E334D909762B148E0
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
0x6AFAC8BBA5A9F3E42C6BF362C7E6CDD7
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
0x441517D309A7C6FA30DDE8FB31D68125
some means."
0x493B04AFEBB315AFEAF184DCB891AD9A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
0x98A8FE90F0378B50688B7992B9AB59EF
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
0x4306A756CAA77D28A0585A4C793E9141

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
0x9770D83503437EDC1393091159FA2A4D
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
0x122CC0DF03F7FAF109D5E3690699F906
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
0xA2157236F973678C66197AB786C78D61
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
0x7B36D7C0744B02FDDA6A1B1C449822AB
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
0x9C279B6F3277504771078F0B9A0418F6
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
0x2CEAE05F419456DC390EAE7E7F8C054F
parting for life.
0xAE17B98E3605CF7F7265A2957BDB0465

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
0x772EA233EBFA8C0CE3360FB84791CFCE
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
0x93AD55431D2F6FE3AAFEE98E950AC388
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
0xE14037F53452BB26C598CE26F1CBAAF5
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
0x32F56A5165930DF30D8A612D09FF6EA7
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
0x7B63FBFD4E0BBEB6A54BCB823CAC1C6B
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
0x670E57F0880192B301A47ECBC2507941
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
0x77C2F36D3FFFC7119C6BDA8B30043A8B
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
0x5491236168A36D8602AE7826DA5CE85F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
0xC81170B24C4F6C52A84A4041BB34C111
she murmured.
0xEAB77C75B67AF4E5AD76E494CEA15F98

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
0x36E7D13EAA9616DB4119E7FB38D77FEF
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
0xB4D3B2C52BE5605400D9C0C0D337BF5A
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
0xD7D029AE709F85D0FA40FCEE7ED2BD69
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
0x74239C70050733EA9B28DC569B5BB6F6
letter.  He entered.
0x703FFC67F786F7D47B5D7A219F233C03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
0xB0014EC11FCEDE8FA35210907C838C95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
0x8E2292F419B44BDB4E37F6EB84A75120
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
0x19E46BB8533FFA28580565B415D2C56A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
0x63490ABBDEBBD86623CA79FDF1C132DF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
0xD88A63075A83B2850E083CE5E2EE7B10
demanded, in a low voice.
0x9D94EEC1EE6EE322D0C00B4DE71515CD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
0x21262C4A9064D4657F46125F357A0740
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
0x8AD8884A8696244B7D28E7BD92593F7D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
0x760298320F354CF9BB8FE40C40033B1D
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
0xC1C2B1435A50AAE653B3DA4903854954
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
0x32A843D65FC4CE43D766E67770E02109
enough.
0xBD7C4928BD7C4928E3F3258E87CC9FB5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
0x6C296898AB18A9783F3A3C52B8F36BFF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
0x0E24FAA7BF791EB370D809C336CEFA1A
Mary.
0xCBD74B3BCBD74B3B8E556D3C21820BFB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
0xCBF07F086681E9A28F339C9145CD6C6F
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
0x123C921D412F56DF63663E2CC0436861
what _is_."
0x01ED475940D29C355A42FC1C8B435FFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
0x77378B08B1778D886EB363D0409552A8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
0x93593EF38829530347E92BA025B8F629

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
0x83E029A570E7A0EA1E79AEA51D373078
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
0xD2D9B05B4D379FE3B376162FDBC2DA1A
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
0xEC510AA297E495E4A713E742CAD06638
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
0x801B2715A6A6E8A0C8255340A615E16F
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
0x005228E1A17F445F3DA29D6AE0BC6764
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
0xE34851B0C43AC3C7C99236E2B9159210
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
0x8DA39E3B3911CF7EDD7197517FE55897
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
0xFC4AA5A679C9B0C2F33CFBD9A851DD6B
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
0x60C447876DB556F535438B817DEB356B
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
0x918B66E65096CF0B1543CE535E8B7F02
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
0x7E40F878BD37746755610EA99D7564EA
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
0xBC0DE76D0611AAF21CB04607D63D4CBE
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
0xC801410889CF7A12724031A4383F5833
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
0x53EF5B6388D016351CF0839ABC19F387
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
0x4BACCFB1908FABBE79785DF8F2DBB7A4
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
0x33FE44A46BC76DE436C2F85B97D3D810
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
0x9581AA5E2CD887499D9FF02DA5C82531
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
0xABFC18CD17F0CC60B0812CA1ED308D1E
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
0xCB80AB62D3ED3666798D8BE6ABC6971E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
0x1C6CDC21D01A22CE512E90F521886E5C
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
0x943CFAD13FC26C163060E7E4D4596451
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
0xD43D7F8EA5F44A977998381549A1CEA8
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
0xAE9529899F39EBCE46BEC0EC478D0ABE
and so the old grange was abandoned.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
0x9B0A40E8A71FBF59187798F63BA1C534
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
0xD85893B92FA6E96B4742A36C5DA46C84
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
0x78EDA8FBD595528A91F830A925B32807
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
0xA68D368D6D3110AF446CAA7D5EC249F3
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
0xE6A31DF52E95432429624EE8EBBE7008
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
0xC2B80EFD601E48FEFD527952ADC1485C
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
0xA1E78602902EEBA0DC1582D7CE04C924
things as are necessary.
0xCEE5DE4340E18D1B92EE9F8FA504C617

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
0xF4C099DF8241A7FD8B3A0CE5A38F6725
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
0x725FC1FEA633EBF81100B662437A3019
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
0x86A38036D3BE0620F6171B20A9E67279
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
0xCE08854382C2CB8731BDBC2FAE968D91
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
0x010E7896B6D03465E5958A8F42852994
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
0x4F30AC4F97D235EB61D0578A54D7F91D
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
0x2DB5DF347902F449B4105E93D7D61DFA
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
0x0488EAA4C3B9A6E6122343F9BA5F5DEC
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
0xCC466D3CD844FD8CA93CE0F3ED903A3D
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
0x6964872E149CBE9D790F1B912DB2B0F7
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
0xAD5AC6CB79B0E65E7DEA773CB1C41139
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
0x0CA1BC30651E950072422C5F9360309F
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
0xBAEAB9A40EA50F356A1B3D6F1C7601B5
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
0x6C279ABD6BE7184608BE0A9E9013EA29
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
0xF2D9C4E0339C4AAEB6D26122EE889A71
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
0x8032778205335750798E5ED85ADED037
on from day to day.

Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
0x95694EC7C7B6F4A68234CB86D4BDC7F2
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
0xC3DD40CBFA1FDA5310978DC578321EF5
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
0x63D0332E5E7567202AD46A77D26C9893
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
0x8365D6DD7A984E47E72A0050A6A90B3B
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
0x2ABBD609772F97B16DB94172A84F5BE0
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
0x874B1044998787B0850DC3410CE708C1
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
0x0DCC1F8AFE77299C769E153CD15E6252
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
0x02215D3EFEC5E50D20148019A0ED5D5C
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
0xAD1504AC85304366A7CD26B1DEE36087
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
0x05D7315CD48CB5AE0922B5204A78A4BE
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
0x2A37A3DCE59DA35EB3E4794416108FC0
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
0xF271B91D2738974BF8861F42A7725E55
gratification for disgust.
0x01B0CF06DB174993F47F501431678A4C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
0x94CD30A137BB4584D95AEB9EA38ECEE7
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
0xCDC8A12F22A35D8197518F9E72F37EF6
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
0x3475830BB20F3DCF3F9C05FDB37BBAF8
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
0x1FBDA016C06D4CC40533E1E0EB76A4DC
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
0x8A38D4768BCB0AEC64DDDE4711DB7281
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
0x76815914A2D633C9F7F26BBF1CF0D531
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
0xDE3E75A04DAB72C07638F536248A3ADF
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
0x90D4D3355A4E2CFFC7AFF92F8B35DBC6
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
0xAB3513A547DB444DC8873EA88B9BA03C
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
0x9D729D55006DC327133E02267E6D0C25
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
0x53CC3431727B7D3A0EE5CF2CE038D370
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
0x9101DDDE5F7E2D097E4A565EF2E5A51E
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
0x2D5C72592B77FBC85911F7294D3BFA60
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
0xF9CD8E673D3202F12A99948FF2946BFF
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
0x9B53DD75D3EBF5AEF10ED1557A8D2602
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
0x4DEC0CB4601ED1412C0FA1EC322E082A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
0x3967D834F9F805806FDB723A0652EA78
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
0x68999DABE9DBEBFB468D7867AC771C25
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
0xD1E01114470567F1A5A64B703E16545B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
0x37D4AA07FE42146E267C163CBEF6E496
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
0xD854BE2CB891D1CEBF2C7B878275011C
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
0xB8191E0C605036F4C204CED7500A4CA8
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
0xA66A4A33C553BE31D269089926507886

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
0x0FDE542DC130B4729508AF4E3E181E36

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
0x1B879073512026A8102E4F0F1EA93F3D
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
0x42E0E7F075EB6CC2AABE9CF32548338A
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
0xD94623A1349A11D3CC08AB9E23CE63CC
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
0xB45115EDEBCBAE21852F922A24943B7D
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
0xAFF2FAB3399F3A43140B969B427957C7
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
0x4FFF3473F52C10AEE945911C991C0519
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
0x82A2A4DE82C9FA0CE4FD9D7DBAAE6314
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
0x812900035C79A9B21483A873789ED8FF
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
0x8079BCC409423C2ACA8D0D2F4359B651
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
0x87A053B1DCE886334535162860320E81
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
0x0DD2929060FF925FEFBE8E0D5F07C79E
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
0x053BB9750D47E8552D7286EF3951CCF8
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
0xBE5792C9626B03D418462FE7D76566F7
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
0xC8FBEA54902220151087C8C7579F27FC
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
0xB5A8C9FA8E6C1A8C30BB3A3C2E5C88A6
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
0xA5F60F38A2AE4B368BEB2353B7E51578

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
0xE7F3187D2E35F02EF0C0F4292FD1664F
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
0xB99182F406E058FCC17373D8D15CAF2A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
0x874DD391BBF8796E7CC4BF2780D0F10B
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
0x0B529CEF9C4647E4705C628CFE56FC23
doubtless very visible upon it.
0x9B3DA71648B89FF8994394FF1B7C51A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
0x7B0263C18156307360F2AC639618B71C
asked.
0x0D7203150D720315C04F9A86EA560C80

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
0xB361A4735E418AF5C90997C96D581785
scholars very well."
0xFF9D593F8AC141DE6D45CE3431DFA87A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
0x01B88F14185E1073CFD81E01DFC5AF9A
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
0x201A5DDDA94174248D0B050FB6570843
I interrupted--
0xA27F802AF3E6DBC3E9FA2533DC36785D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
0x23FFA6ADBD9652B4F7797A0D83B4920A
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
0x062BF96A46482852CDC6EB9CDDC41874
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
0x1FB64279323BEE3C1B5B17BF6D0AD3AA
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
0x320695CAB97951D60A49177EF6729632
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
0xB4B01EE6FA24F62694E9B1A497BCA4F2
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
0xA57133C60D0A9C6DF05CE9DA6EC6A53B
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
0xB60754E71480E57F333B043A9F59EE19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
0xF7FC22A853537C2B0FFA5EFED4884456
is dark and empty."
0xEDA787A81B7CC6615B33A43DA5EF021D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
0x020D0BAE30789F8DA325023C764B2AD7
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
0x7B8400AE837152C4F7594B728166AE50

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
0x90482926505A0AA2023A5B09848031F6
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
0x0102AE5674548AD23ED75EDDE995D3EF
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
0x0C4A0EFBCC09075BC722CE0F863942C5
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
0xE7EA5FA165EF5C30D0D6C85823B95FA4
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
0xC0082D64147FA2073CE7FC8C2B0A9519
steadily, for some months at least."
0x3EC95D7FA9A34E55473324EA4D8E4F78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
0x06E0543E7902B2DFF240D8EC81BF137B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
0x7CA6A7559F471B21F8755CB63F08B804
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
0x1E9DBACE438125FBBA4FAE6A7A28B603
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
0x2E84574FF2C411BC56083CD5F027C26D
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
0xE5E711539216BBB16C4A45ACA0A73E12
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
0xF59A4D524D4F8746A436B852531D0A3A
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
0xB33D94A0E225B9040491EDCB2303CA7D
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
0xBFAE610973A6F4F1DEFB17C3751CB536
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
0xBFD3C8917ACD81F544A2EAD8C6FE4D7A
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
0x88CF802FB4E6855D7267E390B9E33EC8
rougher than it.
0x433C8B6C5507F22539499B87302A7F64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
0x1E15F3C09AF2A0BD78AC81E43ED67A76
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
0xA52377DAC879B9D76AB69DB928118F6B
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
0xF2403C9D3D74040A39006D20C86E03CA
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
0xC7917C8624A955E169C25906BDFE8D10
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
0xCC4C79E6C005B453A377A507EFA6EB3E
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
0x652DE68F242805A014FA2C290F8C8BA6
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
0x30463445EE8E9B952B0C3D82659B2ECD
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
0xE6404DADCAE9E6CCCB92C9C568621DD0
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
0x37D00977BCB8A9736A2141B48331923F
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
0xAE1E38EBAA097A84EC33AA9867E33B9C
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
0xC60A589E808E2F9D6E91DDD9BB9CE162
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
0x8C66B35EC820C693B655BF9772D7C583
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
0x5FC529CE197E1C60D6B67DBF7FF3672C
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
0x6224E5063752D44CAD4B16837BCC88CF
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
0x48D6EDDE9A4AFDB91CC666AEC55FFDD9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
0x1B56834004F7027F8DBD39EE998C9EEE
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
0x619552B8A1A0E719E2A83892E8FE57D6
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
0xF4E516ADFE4FEE89F36F0DD0B6EB3DD3
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
0x90E13C64F6D6358CA0C9683C85812F10
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
0x1EBD3F015834A6721FDD81E5C5604231
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
0x949789D559AE53501F50F19C77B40F70
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
0xCB566A58C54B6752F91634013F6F78D8
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
0x4D7C53D286DA47603E6C4C33FBD57DDF
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
0x4CF5014775A7C7E543FD7ECCB57150F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
0x8D5CC3598DC4AB3E37D65139CD829C26
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
0x3D6A701C1BA2518F71BE80A8D1D5D470
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
0x2D65EC1E2FA5F74D73D11C463121FE69
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
0x1964D4E46FBF325565A4499FF42EDA1C
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
0x4B99C7ADFC2DBBDEDBDEED546AEE7FAB
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
0x9A7CDB8588B8A917915734977F4CE69D
exclaimed--
0xB84332676B56CBF59B6873A815E7B461

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
0x8A8ADD5DAFD731449AFF320EF81C92F6
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
0x89DA744E327997ABEA13986B2692A24E
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
0xEEE1801739251F21A1511D9EED0244A4
your back towards me now."
0x27476E92D2FEA3A67D60625CC9ABC446

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
0x298C175935A5FB10026AF45BF8E2BFFA
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
0xC91AD5E217E12EDF9CAE4D08B1C39445
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
0x6974ECEC0663EFDE7422C9EABE97879D
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
0x979E5BB269B15C3992CCB547B8BD2C53
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
0x26FE68CEAAE1A0D07D947752AF8A8066
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
0xECECA622747A977EEFB4B8D3599892A5
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
0x51381CD8D0DA8AC521BD1803574624B8
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
0xB1E5413B9DEFD8BC5CF0BAB5E73CF89E
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
0xDD38F7FCC883B957E91BFF1CCA6AE282
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
0x084EDA7CB16A8E631BBFD8D3296896F6
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
0xF0BD85713D6FA2015D787ECA85F471AA
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
0x6CC918DA911B7BA3DD510ED769D433B1
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
0xF167E3CC5756914ED20E0F85064F79A8
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
0x8481CE60444C9BF4F4B2A807E6705702
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
0x7505D60FD27D5531B05642D0F04E5BB3
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
0xCDE2EE46399D7DBBED6F38513DB9B4FC
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
0x545E5ACD3C9A5EC695EF06C09A0A5BCF
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
0x58B322A6D34D3ACB5AD988BB6B5820A8
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
0x77E2619D2A40EC445FF9D44D9698FC8E
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
0x77072635BB7125D1F2DAB510290DB6EA
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
0xA82DAA5BC13D3BA3FB38F2ED13A25994
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
0x3F611899A9F58E0AC9471D1734D2260C
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
0x101D55C6CF75AEEB8540D140DA8A16AC
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
0x56020EB16B4CB467E7C09ADFC9E2FEC8
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
0x6612A7E6AA5B58C94631E9213B5B56D6
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
0x805A6C2B5386C6FA13713AE1B343F2B1
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
0xC977D2723AD0044CA463CD9533913B16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
0x95EE49475B763C5AA5C61153D67AEBED
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
0xDC587AD6E1DBE9AD79680E750CECE41B
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
0x820993095FE8DF3E81A70C5A39EF2F5A
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
0xD31FD3E2E8FA4411646E0AA167CF7E06
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
0x8FEC1DD273FF3EC51C7EBDEAF0B67C21

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
0x55824BADD3F00FC18A9008A848384298
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
0x313B7E10792C716B0147B3CB10AE5E0B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
0xCCB371ADD93B8ED315961DECC3C3C3FE
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
0x3A46CDA9CAA429D24BE8A97C8D52B85C
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
0xCA9B1E276EA6DCBCC559E1B8716E09CF
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
0x3FA3026B7CDBC0A7012C486AF749FF0E
pointing to me.
0xA21C4018BAF02218715AD4971B4237AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is," said St. John.
0xE96E2B28426437F90B02F41E17FBF846

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
0xD2B5226391CA9E76DEFC7C09D818F8CB
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
0x130196A7FFEE58F03EE9B1ACA5B2A22C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
0x073B1842931763D5A957BCDDB289EBD1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
0x75C69EE07BD27ABE1B3DA69FB3E88842

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Quite."
0x8336DC91500F01E5A39D16F81F333919

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you like your house?"
0xF37AFFC8661D54558B1BDD87E3BCF572

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very much."
0xC29EFF877087E77B1D14338CA02D3370

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
0x1C0000CF4E4AF407E0E499C64B48CD3D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very nicely, indeed."
0xD21DF6EF9185661A270400F3FF7288DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
0x7EE32E1692A0B4F9ABA360830F6FDC50

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
0x232A6436814E9CE6B11F5FA99A2B4D6B
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
0x67327E4FB7D2A18ED7E13B8441CE66DE
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
0xF225A476A22ABAD45A5EA621CCCE1128
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
0xCDBEB34AE3F5B211B1047F7877371C2B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
0x84FD596BFE66D1E1A352B87FF8A92116
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
0xDC99F88D0474D2ECEDA6E95AF720DD8F
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
0xD9D51BE73A540AF8CE1DEE3493EBD375
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
0x396FC8D95295D80061FBB1E8CC94E123
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
0x60FA59B6A5989B5794681BC8224DF60C
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
0x960C0659E1ACD81B205B4502F6B887EF
merchants to shame."
0xDC8F3C1D967BBCDE3517E3C00FC89F9A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
0xE8D027FFA6A903DE7F3C02F3DA6BB174
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
0x7572AC7F01765F1A61AB4B9D12B3B23E
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
0xCB03717FFF34F626E564EF111E4D6C91
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
0xE804B5C2477AD73E53E0A66737000E4D
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
0xE73729870B54CC81412E8D5A2D40ADA4
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
0xBA70D2503279362B43F3B58A8DE8286E
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
0xDD82DCBD86184BA76AA8493B9C4D70D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
0x89129FBB483F8F748091F1C513854558
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
0xFB55EBFA3FC29CC76BCBEC9FC9DD6433
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
0x6FE35F8784B579827872633E92A0757F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
0x2AE33D66732E63E40A7E9E28899F378E
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
0x9072C63E95270EC16A1BD276E8B8BE3D
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
0x276E22511A75161B48FBC9357B177CA5
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
0x98A96CF61B23AEEA8CCE333653F29533
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
0x1DB211762DA7125727E33B19624CC8A1
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
0x1EAB9BD30874516F4DF0FCB4A94B7678
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
0xADE382ED867FFA90F90B2246DE85EE0D
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
0xD2A6AB49EF5542E9E248FD758F3841AE
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
0xD348A7B589BCAC9C873541B767D7DF44

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
0x3CFDBDD3EDE9211C2D86DBCEC0199D66
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
0x78C2BF25D7D6A20862A315AFDBC2C304
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
0x48CBBD79CE4FD636FA203652748959B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
0x6949DD9E79486730D02B30DE8FE1CAB3
John.
0x815C8F10815C8F10D2E31A43AF7F9571

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
0x69C97341A291D0CBCCDB4DAD01C3BC80
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
0xF3881ED3360632A95024C7D6E9CFFDA0
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
0x0D022DBA7F6DB722F0E58C48665C7FBB
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
0x152CFCE6616DF476363C227D1DE9EC2A
her own.
0x835FEEF5459CC2614AF701AB00722A80

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
0xF668AD002347070DAE87D7648DB88085
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
0x80A24C28F49AFA8CB7A5DA2296FC9C1C
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
0xFBB760DDBA6CB0C26C1D958E7F226902
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
0x3488166CDA19FDA8F6A1B1EF008BCCDC
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
0x5C78AD175E108DAD127A266E12D78716
papa."
0xE7A8EF5CE7A8EF5C07914110ED95EF64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
0x43A7C84877F9A5BB9564F292B6909FCC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
0xAB585E11FA3E3682A071159BCFF073D6
it cost him thus to refuse.
0xFF1DA4F0A4709C311ECF0925E660500E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
0xC3899C06555D13BAB750C18FE5D61593
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
0x60FC3843DA881907276C25C0B8CE579E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
0x87835E086BC9975A4978A1B810199C16
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
0x56B43F6A9E04C2579E192C7CAE2515A3
returned.
0x8CAA91B4772A38F2A97C432C90FC037D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
0x64DBF8B406CA20BB93C675361001BAA6
blanched as her gown.
0x9D4538BC591EE1446B2CF8655111CB2E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
0x026DCA0BD878B3B82F103F745BE305BF
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
0xC04DF2411FE0921B1519F72DB82308F0
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
0xB56B729968FDD88C6DD18B194E31848E
at all.
0x55C0006455C000647A161C2C5BC0D13E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
0x004AE30DBB7121635AC538E6CF40E5CE
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
0x0B01762B1B69251583BDF618DE3F6C2D
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
0x56C88A7993212D75913E7803499BD4C2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
0x6AC9CF26A58016FBF3EC20A5DA2DB910
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
0x0116D4589608F1D53EDEE65724E5EBA0
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
0x8E9104EE208F2691223BD615C6165535
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
0x5F2B585C9791AC29042C1FF736CF3859
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
0x02A23D35C70A0A4503D567037DF9C229
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
0x66ABC542F1C445FA3F22E0ADB6BC37C1
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
0xB5E39115F53B0EA154684E8CC1979662
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
0x30F7EB08CA10E4B051D4A38374AD6218
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
0x742ED2CEF238D88692A7C0845CED506C
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
0x5424695BAD6011018BE788E749B0D63B
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
0xFB1570C1BC9B4C0EEF38F427464CB11A
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
0x0BF9C0A3F4828E4E4622F008DE5405A2
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
0x28E1518C7FC302ADEA6862C0A1D77DD3
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
0x180A42E96316FE6EB135D1D57895FF13
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
0x7E1ECB2093A891EE4D412998D00207B0
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
0xDB18A485F0E77CDC4DDF1CF850A6A30F
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
0x8A8B984AF9D0163FE457E18C06734BE2
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
0x209C6812ECCA32C4830C0A825EA4DB2B
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
0x07BB9130E94AC79416AA0611C2E0D51A
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
0xF34CC1EB768335F3B8B6E0F023296218
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
0x2929277C01DDB22486EDE5BE134B9E21
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
0x147C87EA8647EB0E7703B3637C3D8D13
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
0x94B454FADB2BC08880202993F6C6AF03
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
0x43EB574CD28861BF3D82E327E587F5B3
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
0x6829A1F0EBC1AE2FBABDB2E5CE74B429
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
0x0B84DC9FA9E935373FC2E9180CA0983C
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
0xA0BAE1D27B719BEDA1A319DE52AE3BEB
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
0x7611CB8443C9B2CAB53A1E73BD9672EE
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
0xEEF6DA0874BFB38AD6CB6FE0362009E8
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
0x2EC57B4D25D2234A86A75F3A021CF35A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
0xAF2455934BC861A0F47B0ECCFFF09132
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
0x1772D426B3702670147D0A571F5E825C
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
0xDAB95992C4A6B940B28EDACB987FFDEE
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
0x5803A8F56FED37134990EF3E361D5E0E
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
0x36B9CC0FA8BB199B8C5E9E320EEDA08A
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
0xBA338A531250046D38E7EE715F5D2D8E
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
0xF148ABC7EB57E4A97ADAF977EC8CC0C8
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
0x97A3FE55B8CFE5C67AE5D98CD3EB9557
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
0xA3D0562268F4102C635338974B1B7AAF
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
0x912D3E22F27D4BBEC16EA57A04A7F233
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
0xE16A44B54474009557F07CAFAFAEEE52
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
0x5BDDB6CF940BB57F41D2541342138AC3
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
0x8CBBD271EB7175B11D5EF930B31434D4
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
0x353D9E531C4E9A3C720572B5C77B6FB5
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
0xD6D92695E9B0364603E7553F57EE81FB
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
0x5D7F5D556ABC3D9C907940553C8A7795
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
0xB0E0E7F873609C87FFC4CD4CC8B9EF99
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
0xD28649CDE57344A7ADDAFBFDAD66B531
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
0x4B64C8DEB0B8CE287020D8842743282F
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
0xBB3D0C6DF31C0F88EE414D816297A2BD
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
0x17278F55589E366D9CA8B61B21310D31
duties of the day.
0x417A879B614CA9D688AD794300A5D052

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
0xE821C060C66AA946C34C5FDB348913EC
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
0x02988E54897B945BB5999130BF48E400
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
0x6582D83ADD6BCE01C9EC70BC625183BF
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
0xC3186FD09E4C9005184934CFC8C5157D
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
0x87C1FC81CAC5C391AFC3284CFAA04021
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
0xB642AB901F0198CC5B023CCC316401DF
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
0xCEC9DFBD31B47ED60D68192BF716A518
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
0x7F00FB5CB5203FE4A3181403F0218C00
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
0xA6F2FD7FA4AF62F949F485B0B56BDD73
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
0x115BDDF89F09AB55F46C2885A4622470
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
0x972E70B5A1A5F2457814FA5DBA8AF7C1
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
0xC23A86788FD67256470F838F58CFD353
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
0xB9EE732EE483F2B4A9F84670FABA15E1
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
0x990BB9D6B9E74EEEB82162C2D816DBFA
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
0xFD6EF9602F6C4D70EFE76060424EAD6D
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
0x825BA46F3BA9696E307AD5B9E8B4426C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
0xF8AF7013BF0D143D139421D9615BC4CD
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
0xDE0C635422B704F4C14B27139DCC3E14
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
0xB8CD526F73356090FCA6B823658EE4E1
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
0xE4CD5FCD3456C6CA4525669232380B09
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
0xE29F20D3727326AE9E9AFCE999B2853D
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
0x418AF3299A5DF2ED099583792A17F3AB
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
0x765C76BE89314BB69AEE22E4F6392FB1
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
0xFF62308F27AA1D373EB14E2ADE1B7191
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
0xD489E8A3C319B6086E337A852371A19C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
0x0CD76C6DA251C8A6BFC6DAE8CEE3FD4D
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
0xE9F97DBD61A709AC7BB77EAF64EC2454
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
0x19E73F19572B828D6308BD1D7436F523
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
0x09E853D07A7F6FC531DF57D39DF40515
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
0xD96FA9B97E792EEDCC42BD86C924F6CF
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
0x4FB7224E1B6E0DBAF3ADE278D624E3EA
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
0x26DB974F8510F7C6B38533EFEC747472
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
0xFF2DC6784B22AC58AD7E46EEEE56396C
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
0x9102EF673EB39D99E46280DAF6327F51
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
0x82A2E7921AF17EBFDA13B839D45B564B
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
0xFCE014B5194F7DD5A65A2A967CFC85A6
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
0xA28986B44BEDEBFF02D1D54C9AE233E7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
0x0644C7EF1746831DFAC48723CD39C0EA
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
0x4F1F48F293434402E3A83450EA544557
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
0x4F715CDAC534B8F758CA54D45D4B7A76
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
0xE281F20E79FF24CD93151A447915CBE0
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
0x91384CFC4E23FC83ADAA46F01183338A
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
0xABD0EAAA4234B4586EDBA1CFC3FEC79D
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
0xC7AE793443B3C1D1E0CD4699ECD7468B
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
0xA14CDFBFBBA11F6A6CBEF0674EF2B1A7
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
0xCE2E498A8D81DA584810684EE7B4B1DC
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
0x5BBE3AD529B677262DE56B003D32395B
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
0x360036359CC71DA37F43FC587BBCA7B0
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
0xD247DE88F9F746533D6C40D98601FA4D
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
0x7C7D79E5D8848007468D02009ED36E8B
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
0x094CB964524FFFCB791E27F3D1447385
acquaintance.
0xD210F8D2A83749AFCDE2BF4B7606CAF0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
0xFBAD288780BD6B6EC9CC14EFFBFA2D9E
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
0x109E2757BC0591AF0D460EB2AA0796FD
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
0x06BEC965F90772D001D9B755E183E86A
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
0x188583F2C42D55AFF46E5839BA6BB9DE
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
0x2AE396EF6D1BF7D7E92683ED04AA3B80
if known, would make a delightful romance.
0xB30EB3CD78E8B0BF240CAA2EDB73FFFF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
0xA13D121004665CB5DAFFFC32FD3037AE
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
0x3EF610A10385FD389B5CAC0BA616B558
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
0x1ED33991D13C4A61A2C095A93656158E
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
0x565359AF84A0964324644169A70A1CD9
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
0xFED31928B49079ECEA979C4911E90D2B
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
0xEC54E763555CF8A17F6FE39ACC7D3063
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
0x147FD7D0A3067E4570B9D36865010247
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
0x13E1EC3A15446DDF68EAFE0D1688F530

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
0xE9AA159B02AE7F9E76D395517F8B168C
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
0xB78CF87B7E1B7EE072E23C26E33F6A8E
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
0xEE9CAC6D20B4F93B6E16C4A01F32DB32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
0x951AE663A11B305E9CCAB30060796FA9
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
0x339F22C866972F43C83286B1C23B60B4
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
0x98890E92A535B3C2671546CEFFCFAD45
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
0x07238E1B5A6E7AEA3145830DC83C7DBC
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
0x533072B6B7748AB9E429A429AC1A35E9
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
0x92AEF80BF16AC67362CABC7CABA18AAE
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
0xBF0D27944248484F31A89FE74DAD814E
day.
0xF9B8FA65F9B8FA65BB95E4BEF39C3484

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
0xBA039F6EDF14055DE009D7B5376149E1
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
0x44EF1CD3CF21748D40F9989123F34CC9
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
0x9DFAFBB17767C3990F06F3BEB88E92DF
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
0x62FD29B4CAC1C96AAC7746C0CE7028CC
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
0xF4FA4F0BED8E5135E1E80A854398C896
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
0x67DE1D8F490BC310C37C9E95D1F18DAE
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
0xD7C9B73C0A4DF22C8750CE6A0310C8DE
Hall.
0x6E58B0D46E58B0D42715317391676353

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
0xB19B53CB3EC8AB85F24E49F0D9CC93F6
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
0x3264A3A278A77EA41B16B523D96676E9
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
0xA395685A294961864841AF7BB049DE3F
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
0xC22B044108D2EE60041D8CE5B17C52A2
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
0xE70CAA1743D163D6E346E34A7691A140
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
0x9A22018F6BC3FBADCD658D398842D38F
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
0x06DF9E47B718E05F9CA213F097F42E30

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
0x183BFE4D09332662FB4B36DF9316E95D
high family, papa."
0xE0DF7893AAC4654483AB3A4CD909DC61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
0x4B2E79254E28C5206ABF31DA42B10525
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
0xE1521322874F11D5128DD7744BDD4383
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
0xEC49C4AFE2BAD3D84D8AEE8A92D891C1
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
0xD89D01E2638BC772A5BC7A18A43902F8
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
0xBE4E3A64E0BFC0A4DF6237A74B02DA17
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
0x50801024F3B7D1888997B12AB7A944C5
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
0x350EA586BCD16BDF520A967BC27CD49D
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
0xD1B74D7BB614C1709E2360E943B778F8
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
0x6F7AA3CB1137025974B04B52A237B78F
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
0x9D43D21B76327D0D926944B21520D122
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
0x7CF075D44D0D1E05780CF4B56FD75D9B
compensation for the want of fortune.
0xF2219A3186BB7C12D81C6C65A3F96F90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
0xE71A72D70EE82956F86F83482C3344DF
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
0x2A7E213A37C414F963F169362E75DDAA
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
0x066BBDF496BD9315AB1453FEB64E27C0
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
0x6A3ACCEA30772114304625DE5C48299E
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
0x3B1BF13556963177E0C22F4EA1C32D84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
0xF4288372C09AFEF48030C6D7F88B5B18
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
0xE671651EE0E6BA79E855DA552C260812
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
0x0A722A913D3CF7EB82B1AC073D619868
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
0xE710D1E72C38ED255698EFBD33866915
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
0x913DC4217DA29452CC43F5126BC501F4
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
0x9A7F2AEA260B090E547CA273EF314AFB
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
0x1ED83D0EA75C0B45342C8C6652A35E15
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
0x50A41E3F8FCABEF5C119937C20E3BB79
Rivers.
0xB3583479B358347997D3B244A26526A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
0x9ADC656090A9F8EFDED57C86CEADCFA5
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
0x42A545DD658C88CE8C725E01627C8391
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
0xC9201907DFE72733975736C02FC58F8A
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
0x7EE146BE1BC2C6B917B87606D11C5692
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
0xC29187EFADD58B4FE0224537C0B62C7F
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
0x023EF3B6641AB933C3BA5C2F91BF7B63
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
0x30BF56C696EB1E18DFC17EB2B5898819
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
0x94EC193BBEF1B98BDEEFA3E17C0E18B0
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
0xF0249E1CA796E3BF89F48CEE2FB92022
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
0x51F628814E29361B11CA85B3E8BE04E9
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
0x26C41EF6ECA8690942224ABEA9488A7C
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
0x3A4C9449819053C3A1D9BF584CAA3FFD
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
0xD0B918ED03B02286B396813170019695
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
0x77DBF5E053AE9C83E80FF5531ED57A72
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
0xB5D0A1CC52674F8EA61F1165CB4D8B72
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
0xEA3C393CC46FECEF3B22A2469C72D17D
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
0x9CCC9BB0A08F8036457F457ABE3AE29F
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
0x41E322E234C395DD75265B2F610E6929
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
0x886477C9813EA5A72DC19C7C69894DE5
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
0xB68F618D73DDFF79975E46B61B816CE1
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
0xF134D8A665EA327DF4D222A5019450C7
him some good, if I could.
0x4F72855467D789AE0FBBE07C616A08A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
0xA462434FB0F7B1206B052D0BB302FE8D
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
0x3EE12BA0FD698754643C6A9F6E2D819A
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
0x9831F53D9577F01E9BEBD6212EAD1F94
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
0x6632E7DED78BC4934A76A8F925DD18A7
him talk."
0x26A522187162F6CA59FD28ED1AE52146

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
0x45FF3116BA8FA32A21FF575859E771AC
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
0xD5EFC4E4C0C53C59D901EA4701616AAC
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
0x873B5FAD4017556B99E910CC4D194DFC
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
0x0954EE577DD27409813B6CA2A1A94501
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
0x6EBC8631DFD5F00EC7DCE16F1037BF78
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
0xE305D061B9174D8B8EB3329FCAEB4D55

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
0x7599E3F4D312A0ACE674663D18E9F0F4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
0xF0865737278FF9F433C8EAA00878468F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
0xAE8BA809C3202E999F86498FC8651D90

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
0xDC6CAAD73F6016CDE3B883D57094EBDD
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
0xA11B900D7D38DCF7968A8D0E394D192A
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
0xAE35C0832DDE42BA166B93DEC016B2D1
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
0x6AB30C95815B367DAFF9B9CA8B07D3C4
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
0xD9E05CB22B23DC982667FEFFA0847822
rose and placed it in his hand.
0x0707424FB2CB168B0748BC68B9E462C5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
0x8162F97589A6948FE58BF45E0C9A5B6D
graceful and correct drawing."
0xBC35F05CCD130C7683A16D50ACC93BD7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
0x98B40B08D8C2434DB92E76AAD84364D9
like?"
0xB85C5773B85C5773BAF01A95F355EB7F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
0xD21DAA515324F986A3ED36199D6D21CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
0xF300D057B742E9443EFAD7FDBF37863B
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
0x8E9D9E663947C7A8F20219F21D472CA5
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
0x9D0BDC6428CB05F850345DCB78F811ED
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
0x58145644B41729D3A83080BA9DB33C1A
deem worthless."
0x6129BC648452D049B36545C32AEC9C1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
0xF8185D6999FD3979124BE26AE87E2B7B
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
0x5914E5B0BF74D1583A1390EC26E08D8F
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
0x5D1769ABCFB73B93C8BBC48B1948295E
smiles!"
0x7311B160F810FC9935B3D88575F1B3E1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
0x25F4F6585C884D4FAD81A38B03DB908B
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
0x0822436C9BFD50F1B2FB46369CC81E6D
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
0x319EB2AF99CB032C0E6F9850C2173A5C
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
0x32ABC008AB6C3E7C8427E1B3AB6EC0A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
0xFD9C30F22B3C37A573A0C4A60CECCC1C
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
0x850B801CC68918EEF5D4397BCC095B43

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
0x79B1B43D2EDD74DF9A863D33CF1B1B15
or wise is another question."
0x75CCE7956ABBFFAB2EAE0ED2C0279280

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
0x02A78E80912C5E802613EA7354EDA3EA
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
0xC924B0DA361B76B3ED0306E88F41BE3C
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
0xE3F58A99578589917606E1514E9465C5
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
0x57948661E8DBFEEDB6BD3F0EA683818F
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
0xBE4E94EBC83E5CD2423A198A24F19335
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
0x8AA533774CE7A0BE8243EF18B9D7D9F9
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
0xAAA98C98DE2A91417A5B6A6A44BFF0C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
0x640C87E2DE9BECDEB00A03175FD9BAE0
take to yourself the original at once."
0x7287CC12370E213F8B984213B4B0BB61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
0x4EB6AE23777A1F73F65250622169C4BE
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
0x9295E2339A3FE78F5FE4C0B26CA3CE5C
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
0x1D1BC195FB2E429FFB4C02EA31702994
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
0x72E62493EF04AE083F1C24C91F0D9337
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
0x1A50117D95C04993C276157126C68978
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
0xE122724BDB85754F0EBADD31ECAE2FCD
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
0x20EBE565451ECA445F14C204596AF3B0
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
0x4B66C094CEC87069A8C81B7EF299578A
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
0xEE5D944EF398C265BD6D66002E3A7F76
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
0x65110A4F42B0D4482EB2FDEAEA499840

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
0x412EDD3B3636B714BEEAAD22F66F4D08
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
0x9FCC19E28372E66241E241EAE6D5EEFF
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
0x7E41BEAD38EEE9DF3E45243CFA29CB06
ought to marry her."
0xC71501B3DCDCA92F1295FDA3318DD724

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
0x8CF58BBE8B330C0F37254571753AD28B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
0x7E96092717B5775D76B36DF303A027B2
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
0x4E5BBEFFD0CDAFACB54457CE8B6C6866
often."
0xED16F83CED16F83C7F11DB1635218772

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
0x37750821D7E5006AB89CBCB2695C38DB
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
0xCC083A5AE377D9C0A24CA41C3AABFB22
the table to measure the time.
0x56DE98088EC65A69C6DF6F2710F61868

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
0x1200D569710778ED63F4D44BFD1CF7CD
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
0x75FA1240F65DF28B38598B79BCEE85B1
fetter your heart?"
0x7CBEFE85099F1AD6797A8A3207F83D69

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
0x6AE8705DF2CB1EDAEA486AB7EE4891F5
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
0x915D28D3239C9B2F04B8F61B70805318
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
0x77B6ED6E0404C4C05B334F1B95F0B63C
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
0xB3A7537453C6002A0092F7B5786B6C25
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
0x1550D06374A06E589F1D5278C211140D
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
0x702F6B2F5845285B82C3B5C4259BFB2A
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
0x11660222B0B20ACEBD69562FCE1563AE
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
0x09ED6B54742F450A3F2D2688E5A969D1
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
0xAFB0A398C311B4BE25739F1295B3E304
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
0x9F1AC7A3483F8BF9642CBD2B2C07C543
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
0xA5B8AE01F3B64B7CC3E3E75D8991951A
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
0x81C1EDE3E30E02A99436578F0D79BA3D
time I marked pass in peace."
0x9884C05AC00D86521CCE73A99C0E1CF7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
0x2E04A520586D268DD905FB68FF828006
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
0xAF0BE1AE1DDFE94B009C40E89DF25AEB
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
0x52C7454E40BEDBF982F88BDC512A7E2C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
0xC0A5F4047059EC1D67338D4BB0C76339
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
0x4B41F24D73B3C6ECA91A227295BF53F3
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
0xE1425C3DB8086AF07F0B817D62087C04
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
0x12C8C0D6EF45F369B9335A8FF69DB508
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
0x5B4215F9ECD2D28F390D8DD591D0C3A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I gazed at him in wonder.
0x9BE78A407D7AD91F7F49E819098D7F10

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
0x097F7E80CDF0E8C36BE949131D9E8C4A
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
0x2CA86A329953AEB138F7645B9F117D0D
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
0xFFD7D2AC04807717532E0CCED48FF80E
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
0x4832B2C4CF39E1F08C549B60BEE12D2D
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
0x757292998E175A757F9F3E819496C7D4
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
0xAB457842291F7D0FB3CFBA4BBA6A0254
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
0x05EDB3A26D3CE68B637261B30CC0E1C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
0x686467F452B40079543214B6C7280B6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
0x6591A33DF4DEEBCF0937E84614817880
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
0x8187EE712CDDAF19FB48032D97A1E63F
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
0xD1C9CFDF691BF7788431390694F1BF44
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
0x400F1DA0EDBBD61A0ACFB6599756B5D3
a missionary's wife?  No!"
0x73E10EC84D20B366E680882BDE1E029E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
0x2BDBE555A212543BC35404DAB7385F5E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
0x14175EBCEBF8096A6A91153764AA37D5
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
0x755F881BEB96673EEB8B8240B07D2A82
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
0xD3A74655953287854CA2F1BE9CF3A17C
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
0xAE3519DD5913A674D06DE441065532FB
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
0x45938B91B1C0725928BD27BA5F4FECC5
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
0xB38138F639AE88669A8747F977A5B437
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
0xD91D462ACF0E0E1D6991A484F2C153D1
live for."
0x6E380FE57BA8516447660C28FADB6C29

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
0x09AD443DEAD4EB50B25293C863B1B2E8
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
0xE0791236BE03166E0540E29B33B1CC9E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
0x36E90B641D822139695A7175F535CA9B
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
0x57AB480BE7AD124FBECD216BC36851C3
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
0x08D18D4F95A5B356F1DB6D893C7566F8
should do."
0x2203B82E91700020979FE140D9C55598

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
0xE88AB4BCE34E3A6994A228BCB4E0E69F
wasting away."
0x925D165E9AB552A47A19D7218E0F7A7B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
0xAB9175DA58251B48748E24CECADBD791
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
0x6A560D7A5C05D9916E6C31D1BC635523
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
0x41C1B1C306C223A6A4275C5948AC8518
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
0xAAACF3D81F12678638B0A23C80BF5453
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
0x8B8329A9C2DB64D4FCC0510A07B1B1E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
0x92463CFE13FC924DCB0BBE69F11A908E
schoolroom."
0x07ED3A4966C1CB25958B4D020B0963F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
0x68FE26053F93C91D60FBCEF6A1E2D54B
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
0x9FEA88AC1D60BE05789D0FC9FDB7A983
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
0xBA36489DC3D3D1F470D30A6065E60B07
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
0xC4551B17DFE1E37BF099BA1B960B8362
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
0x7B063546922E5A4EDAE7F358ADB37256
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
0xA82BC6100CA0D2499D5CB874A52168AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
0xA607B0E21EF59B52863B71F316678E91
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
0xD94234A6700E832C894E844A9A3F74B1
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
0x675F9E8B040EBC558EF38090DB769FFB
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
0x1E4D7EBFAF6460B5F226BB897BE8C04F
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
0x2C6A2B3119CCD60B0AEF5A414A41258F
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
0xA160DE6C1E63D9A960E0A3BA0DF17647
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
0x23DE35E882BC9819E96936E07E179375
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
0x8C96183829E80CFC9593954FE315EDAB
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
0xCB8769CC7EE2617ADDD2F228E4AF8A00

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I smiled incredulously.
0xCEDD8B48F4845A32FA6CEE7B823425FD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
0x2141D3F5761608FE3F194E0CECE836EF
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
0x5223838EFEDC495ED3333E6026F49F4C
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
0x001C504BAF447EE536EA2E553C7D3A9D
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
0xECBD9804A8783C368E8EEAAC27A3B30C
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
0x205A82078F3994408E0C217A6557145E
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
0xDDB7906C80C57744AB5283F0F38E4747
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
0x04EA834FE97C6D0CCCC16DD43E9408FE
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
0xA1FCE9FF93FBEE4B2C511DB50547F818
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
0x2C4E707A5569AEA5792EFEE6FF53BF94
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
0x8D9D790CAED35AC4C3C2289DD5A93076
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
0xB1DC11C60BD7731841864CE53D1EE3CB
still suffer."
0xACE76CF65D24E1B0A5907C40CB361BF6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
0xD9C123DBE2E7E5C5E95FF34F0637652B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
0x37AECB1F49A2BB4678D640C8D1121E8D
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
0xB90329593431F46E320840C58862A3AF
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
0xE4EC5AD816A50179BB157231EA6CAE0D
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
0xACE064712A12FB0A45F0F095D9098FED
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
0x1BE9DABA5762369B1774DC9BA4DE0D50
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
0x0D159AFA6E1D4361E393595D7A245D76
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
0xFED263FB3BBA15064AA274C7D1EBEB5B
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
0xABEA92D8DA2F0E025D33B14654528DAF
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
0x1EF440831A835CD6DA3353F0956849B0
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
0xD33401377A0ECAD5EE9D6866C53852B9
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
0x56D7C1CB006B7D2C1B7AE9DEEDC52E3F
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
0xEF76B4F5F10541A1383286FC993E85AF
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
0xEE2F0A678F710FF94DF5E009C3069E7F
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
0x92E211684096FC87E661B02324C28589

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
0x73FD7D7DCA0E47F2A7A914C706E266AC
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
0x26D0A4A65761788EF23C166E7A3624FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
0x3198C356AD3EFBFA2E60838A646DD992
World, indeed!"
0xBE63F646072FF34C0E89D649137FFD49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
0x1E56B18E36B29BA1FE80F2AD0BCD1F2D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"_Cui bono_?  No."
0x1EB2BB0C2651C2E851ABDEB14E54BBD0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
0x58A2B4D06ED58184D9B0A419E8ABC5CC
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
0xC0ED35A92A8C922041DCDBE2924A084A
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
0xE681EF0C5264C460CDBBCBB1770B3E66
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
0x9F3648F8EA0D3229C91476591FC81297
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
0xF21DE1DC060CB1BBEF7FF2B79A48A4A3
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
0xED53F9B49B800283815C946894A7A94D
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
0xB64C7317380A36F289217D82928C011F
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
0x7A7B64684861B441E315EA4BE2EDC2AF
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
0x8128833CB23514114205851C10F99992

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is the matter?" I asked.
0x5E39AB542C772D15F29DE14D2029AF01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
0x15F8C13B68B00ECAD9A1D874D7179050
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
0x5E8B01A6FF96486138EA71F6B1DB67F4
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
0x891932710211D56B489BBCE377FF5FD2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
0x86B9E36EFAC43993816A6FF078B177F9
globe, however!"
0x1DC8BC3E6944C48ADA2909B994DF6155

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
0x4879B5B6E6260CAFB11756F620471589
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
0xF97B7F3CCA0624F223918B5B22B77200
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
0x60E6EC15F4D2FAE2B9A3DEA4E3A10AF9
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
0x0F0A158AC40B83C7C6438F4E91083F6D
forgot it.
0x45B24D091799F515BB03F570E8287EC6

CHAPTER XXXIII
0xC2177E635BC72438549A08B019D2DF15

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
0x726DB315AB59D4DF5A9E87F74B7E591E
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
0xC17B3AB4DE3FD0FEB5279AE37B591A1D
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
0xF84810B8A33F8E93020EA51AFEA18826
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
0x966144C5F2671BA4D663D7267DACBB45
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
0xE13F0DF3D3F9DA78F9D9C687D449A124
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
0xDD9B0EA6A5075A9708E11F120A0D5F9A
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
0xEC169262A5AB3C79E6BE19C21329568F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
0x512EC6C3F2F56F6FF18FF67AEC9AA687
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
0x7C36BCE84CB72031D0323D161584F692
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
0x68D6B1FA2561DBEE3708A4BC0E8060AD
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
0x59F8E9BCA4ECD71FD4E248B8B9740BA2
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
0x25008CF93FEAE1F1202A911A07979CEB
      In yellow lustre shone"--
0x240910AC9A0F924A268DA05E9EE56961

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I soon forgot storm in music.
0x3734A0E90942091031D34218737B19A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
0x990BDDED1EC4C76F3A42B1B62AD95202
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
0xE0B456984A3854A883B786712E5D1A7C
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
0xB4653DB89673F7583CA699DF9897EB8F
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
0x07723E11BCEEE1668BE03FABA3F7D23B
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
0x0E32B82757207E3601760F46E163A745
vale that night.
0x3D1D55AB2A9C24D7B12CC9F8E317C79E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
0x850E1E37A5D19EF8D7FED2525E299CB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
0x2DE06C6F2C0FADC378B703720DF073E9
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
0xEF3D1E864168FB2ADB93EBD2C77A558D
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
0xCE69D7EDAE1F70873A8F7972DD6BB2C0
boots.
0x6ECF67F66ECF67F6D057A42FA54FAC05

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
0x6737A10C1BD5C1D19101AB4BD680A915
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
0x32DBB46AD7A4D8FA54697EF8700A185F
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
0x572B66D77C9AC8CFCEE51501EFF06C05
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
0x1949BE9D03FEC9F8039CB790AA9503F8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
0x45180D7F950CC63871CAA9039F9E20D8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
0x91DB575775853F69674EB9287608CDB3
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
0xB48C94CBA0BF8C6D67F71B7750F7891F
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
0xBD2EAD01B3A1D9FBAFB3E8EEB02790C6
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
0x729D371521312E9B28FEE6DB74DBA6EE
impatient to hear the sequel."
0x23F36A62F6C71371B9D9EA5EC47B8A03

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
0x432FB9553BFE5093FC6513595FCEAE4C
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
0x266272DF9093AA8BA8CB3FC5977EDCFF
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
0x28D302167B58EDC3028D49463FA362EB
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
0xFEB1A877386332AAF78D13D98C71EFF2
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
0xE9652258559A2AB5FBEE227116CF40D8
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
0x901D9D4BD79D01B4809627C6A1284420
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
0xAE0F0B282CB35B6E1639726E94A2301D
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
0xFB43B0AC01B0A23EA6E7CD9D73BCDD74
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
0xC2823FEB79B081834D92F1C517148581
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
0x219666DD21D218D45AF95C4F4633F5A2
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
0x2787C5EE735CB363AEEEE38C57837B4A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
0x856BD4E7E18C106CF9D91E772C38F69D
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
0x3405624C6C6FDE908BC64748055C606B
health."
0xEF4A55EA7329F61DB637E1A23DB2FF8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
0xDF74124E616E055589497A62F5A820C4
What do you see amiss in me?"
0x22CF6ED6388E48E5E177C239A5C209DD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
0xEEBAA19CEEA14E2EEE71C4494BAFB421
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
0xF359A9D0924AFDBCB062001925A59D75
silenced.
0xE5A80879327DE83897E19481A3F03EED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
0xF12F6C9F461CD1E852CC1D9A391CA0CE
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
0x6A6CBB341DA3FA712F00C88A99877A39
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
0xF629EE0F08B1D125521CE9966C374228
was behind him.
0x0F1C22A2141BCE2D74AAEA5824C5B21F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
0x8E121211DC714CF88F620FC3B317F28B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
0x43608032A36D0ACB80693682E38ACCA0
alone now, and return to my book."
0x61D7F3C06536CE41E58B89AD2C106A2C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
0x7CBE322B35D3D7B8F346A01F8AAFF1D3
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
0x273279A90D3B5C7BBE37CBC2111AE39D
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
0x72AD7C888147B647073FC82A470A8B26
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
0x11D7CA4606D40A147C7C2E9C2831FB3A
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
0x772D82F3168F14BDCCCA5F733D0E857C
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
0xB39D5A8A89B7F0BF58DE76F6D0DBD45B

Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It

"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the

by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.

Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
0x75A009D775596CEB2D34D4BECB7EFE75
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
0x81D6DD28FFB8759B5AF55F9A8AC2BDF0
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
0xC813A949941FDDE959ED4A982C0539F0
trite or novel, it is short.

"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
0x7B08620A4DE5069F737F4714320B838F
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
0xC2D37172EE7E575921F83C1FF53C0FC3
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
0x99F0923C1844839A153B08ED1DB33A79
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
0x63E9372467C5FB9A4E6615889769778F
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
0xDA7AE0C6EC0C0E101B4B18A84178BCC6
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
0x038B5A8DD90AC33C295666FFEF812E8B
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
0x1DFA4F55ADC23BCA775F833E18C583FC
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
0xFE7CC87DFF48A5C11E8B806ECFAADFF9
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
0xAA2784E34B5DA6B67AD5FF7F225BB28E
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
0x098FD3941A91E596F1A9861C8B02D8A0
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
0x73A9B877B14B47B4131E9219F24ADB72
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
0x729E1703BFA550AB37AA908DD82C885D
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
0xDF241445448C7374D49BA4065847C90E
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
0xA94F03E7C0A48C877C7ECB5FE7C12241
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
0xB3DC6E998ECF27154589B7687018DC31
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
0x512D84F23340628C3A2BD51833C089F7
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
0x75003DBA2F77C6722F10E6FF1478F4C0
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
0x5003027A84BD8D2727BDD5D5AD85E743
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
0xC833C0C2602B173C84137EE51AA4C91B
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
0x24E916A0686797C7920298DF9017A7FA
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
0xF5C342AC15D84D18C6A2806E8B9BF2F0
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
0x940486569926DE6EA75BCFA1C627AFE2
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
0x372AFB3691944F0848BA121616312EB2
Rochester."
0x60A9126424555C527B9A011D4A0C93DE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.

"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
0xF537D467C7EB241B36333376A1A3B1D8
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
0x2B8A702032A726153220DB37EF959349
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
0xA86CB7BC1A97659360BAFAD5CDACA1EA
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
0x0BECC10280AE90B7530AA8E75D1207DC
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
0x245B44E8A061922B8522A408DE09AD78
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
0x41CA94642E458DF00D2B50EC55125350
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
0x0301C9203D99D93F2F2070CB2D3822C3
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
0x6D2373AC0030F439F1323B397E3B4E3C
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
0x14CA6BFE34383DA8EA25D429246022D9
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
0xA6C02EABA1589DB2BCDAC33A61E2DFE6
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
0x6573EF86BEE46CA67B6A52083508AD2A
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
0x43A3B914F1C5A685E3B197D2BFF8804B
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
0xD87BACA8CC850F6AB7B79A544DC97E5A
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
0x871015D78281E73DBB5722A85E976390
odd tale?"

"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can

tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he

him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.

"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.

Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
0x9A973539B18A7668A0ABAEE4481E2223
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
0x26AF880C53342C4C717BCB2A11567748
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
0xD3EACE7819EAF43B18CEBA99F47F246F
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
0x232BF2A27112FFEDFADB0D32AC164DE9
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
0xF18AFF3E59D5349759B8CC03C4868496
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
0xDCA98CBE8596E260794F14123FB3184A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
0x92F606C15CF38E34BB16FB8737D20CD7
warmth.
0x863FAEEB863FAEEB61BC05123291AC1D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
0x97789F6B0D2444050216EF6A3CE6E97D
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
0xDF4CF139DF6205CFF44E1EACFDF09D65
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
0x09E38028A9314CE277449C1FDAFDE9C0
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
0x04FB222C64B308E389B54A462DD6FFB3
down, fairly committed to black and white."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
0xB511F9978039F281BD7F0E6F52F3711B
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
0x3D0C352D6CCA26B67348F5B9CED0BEF5
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
0x68D466DC08E3EF38EB108B5A96CB363E
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
0x66D996FEAEB148D397FD9BDBAA75221D
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
0xDA6A19C3F6BEF14541610C4F7D70902B
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
0xEF5AB5BE4F68ED0BFCD9FF80D616A914
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements

demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
0x9CCD316CB3978F3D7330A891C74570AB
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
0x76EAD1400360314C8409BC9A99DF583B
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.

Rochester than you do."

"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about

Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
0x8E70E8D84A784B51C4335BA6F079CACA
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why

Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."

"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a

step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate

possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the

Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted

in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
0xCAE9C8AAC3BD5BF64BCC4F6F8F142469
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
0xDC4AC9D49AB311A9E0ED257C7E862386
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
0x2ECD68F203B05C4CA6266B8B01AE95A4
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
0x6F66324162C73EA3272897A398510FD8
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.

One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
0xC8E167C2D808FFD4ACCC806A540D535A
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
0x5832A4EDE04FA5768F126DB2802EF083
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
0xE250337E58C6A359571AFA0D006C9735
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
0xCD8C09451DDE480193FB967B4F80A3D8

Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
0x03CB2B2994B433117EC137962BB6B0E1
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
0xFB7CF890552D66905DE138034ECA5258
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
0xDDDBEB69EE564BB368B860BB0FCB282A
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
0x131574C2D628EC89C7A0CDBEC1CFE590
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
0xB0DFE1BB5C17D0E8D32CDC07C63802EA
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
0x64CD81F812C6E17F3E9B026A53063D1D
that--that thought swelled my heart.
0x53AE04431209242880FA71CB567E2016

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
0xEA303F55579D6930169C15B84B197C78
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
0x4F75DCAAD7C22068E84723A8E4C723B4
will ask how much you are worth?"
0x4BC762F6745B0FCD015ED07DE8B36F42

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How much am I worth?"
0x7A1DCF589F827DCE9014C053BB745A8F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
0x9D47404A8E0655C8C9F4D98FC8E3EE08
think they say--but what is that?"
0x8DA715DDFEA16F8CFD454B04FC6A64EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
0x860CC85F110870989A21BF7D15F7AFF9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
0x02D69E4BD5C664984D51F6057EC6FF9A
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
0x364AE4070950FD5E8AD9A44D99D2B7B2
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
0x620FCAE2E575E94348B5C55B629B6CB1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
0x3926D6381DFE86BE13105CEBE6C76502
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
0x532104C596F60F5926F19041AC8F5BC6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
0xB673BD6A565B8A40A0DAAC3181FB2DF7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No mistake at all."
0x72B278FDCF66639D00EEFDC07A7C868E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
0xFD191A6010C8CF869A3B7C33E2FC3704

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
0x5657913CA2B79453FA73D372C29DC074

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
0x4ECD341C4603630143807898F43F2D39
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
0x7A80C5E9D6404E523BA43E292C83938C
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
0x7F145239727E236CF0098C2817A25A35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
0x2B62B28C8930EB0A5C85E2FD53934C9F
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
0x52DC5487CAE84BA559B767F85472AC7C
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
0x933716DDD9CAF7FA5828AC30CF865202
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
0x305DBF17AC8574E63A813A28C21FB0A4
Good-night."
0xCF260BA0810F59349E250D44AF74235B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
0x39D008F480DD1603CD624830543038E0
minute!" I cried.
0x6B21949C7BAB0AECD81A9F0B1FB0DBB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well?"
0x6F923E786F923E78AF31CAC93693870C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
0x644AD1F44BD278A43A12A9A73CA9ACE1
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
0xA222F55F4E4E4D2512FC2F0D59D4D5E4
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
0xA0DD240A0834E9F9AAD9D85743589FAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
0xEE48892C8ABB693C5F37D570175911A6
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
0xBC7D4CE1076C6D81E8D308FBAF528021

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
0x19CEF29F0A5891AF103876CF9FC6B4AE
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
0x79CDF85BDAE683E3EF7D859DE15D6234
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
0xF1CE636DE35A29FA9BD8B278648C0D19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
0x0EF8FFFDAB96CDA4AB7E41B0228D9BEB
about it."
0x6F1DCD227793C488BB85309194AE9A1A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Another time."
0x3947C6615C522365E64B01D991B5FC9D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
0x2897FFFA3D2DC1E39F35CDEFB9E31D78
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
0x244A2F54A61FAC1A0DF4F84DD67A9B3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
0xB4487691A892E2806E84433208E309CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I would rather not just now."
0x3BAB26BF4446EE99FCF29138A32696E2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You shall!--you must!"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
0xB9426E14D67DC9405BF75B4EFC8A833F
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
0x4B24CB10995B571B500C0FBC6F23F2A1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
0xAF1E1DAAC11648F4C6C6C3B21CD53C2D
persuade."
0x7872316865E2CC1B00DCA6E1975BE4F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
0x6F205DC9731E2FE528624EAB418675A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
0x5EFBCE1D806E21CC6523B4FFCEDD49F5
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
0xE4C813C4E2BB6038A61283E3D4AABD5A
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
0x7F03720EB1FD11CCA2134C38B6917F7B
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a

sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
0x27B45594EEC6A01830777AFDD5143846

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
0x4AA4F56BA89AD32C7AD964BBEC3D1776
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
0x606B7F42BDAF5C208EE967DC1F9FEE61
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
0x8CDDFD41811F69A4E0A447612222A417

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course: that was all settled before."
0x9B6DF94E9CB0817A89D5F99CA01F0590

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
0xAB4F05A93555FB59A34A7458B71412F2
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
0x0D7F255593760BA8E01676FDB25F4375

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
0x5C57EBDC15643810DA90A71EE80B2A83
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
0x6CFC87A4D3282D23CFED824B084983FD
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
0xEC604D7F2E3B42CD5C3B19FF780D6F89

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
0x113C36AFAB9A9B1FDEE6A57475C60DE4
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
0xA63285CAA394242C78250F51C1DADB59
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
0x5DA91BA878A75DD704AEC45E1567C0AF
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
0x0B47C7F1114D0664CBFA81D713617E0A
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
0xF1011521C7FEEC7707D3A424BDB8DCAA
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
0xAB6D61FD7674BB45CF9CE1963CB54A50
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
0x64697B65214F26927F50CE3A7C1796B4
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
0x2F832780109F55F4A4FDDF5FB7B78326
explanation.
0xE724BB9099DA97CB271CB5D2D2C4D8C3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
0x301767B6C1B4629C1051FFFB10E8B8AB
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
0x05E4CD91E7A3349A99E0DB3E380A403C
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
0x3EF23F849C5D2998F18E7C87997425A6
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
0x7BA95FD5368770618A26BADA73F11200
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
0xB13A018A9554FAEBF69C007E2B5F4A4E
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
0x6494083354B24DD0649A12EAEA47CEFE
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
0x861B2BF0A3CDB64E49FFDAB49F109C83
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
0x5296328B69891606F9A6090854CBA29A
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
0xBA1BECB0867EC555AE29DDF6A31C2B0D
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
0x6CDAB7CFF5270EB1C486938FCF4786BD
against the door.
0xF3C16EDEEA8D6CE91A16F4474690DE47

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
0xE7F55B66CD6383BBBFE6AAA52CACA8E7
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
0x2CA11B8623DC0773B5AA1DEA1D567894
enough.  I resumed--
0x70A8D4B1DD09C76B0681AFAEDBE0F6EE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
0x43074C8C67DC3FA29A57C2C2694B8156

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."
0x2F87FCB42F87FCB41CD2AE7C0895E845

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My aunt, consequently?"
0xEA084E2709ECC43BDFA890DC5BC3F1DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He bowed.
0xF91A5FE17A688569298973085C7658BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
0x335D803B2DA9774CAA043B83EAD31765
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
0x1ADBE5115D9C2369D822240F962FCB04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Undeniably."
0x5B912BD1B6033461F8467F3795084ABA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
0xFE0C225BD9B2489EBC5E2AA8DC009F98
the same source?"
0x7AF9D6AA0E6683A3E3D8031DB3BF10A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We are cousins; yes."
0x10D5174293D73FAC6D158399181B14C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
0x1418BEB27AFE6C83F64D43620DA2B96A
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
0xF993A31480C6E78364570571DCAD470D
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
0xB484F0AAC3FCD47737AA73A4F4081DEC
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
0xC5D10469CB8550E544332382D1BEE912
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
0x74BF6EE592E4C3AB9CE0E0468A888154
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
0x5BAF183F703A58E914B8C4BB35FA899C
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
0xFEAEA22254B7F469E155CBA8E141C480
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
0x59E2FEBDC2B0B309E9D6A160E352F441
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
0xEF5A78AD824020A8BA92B63D8F1981FF
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
0x5CD26333098622111BAC70880DC8AA92
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
0x7548C0CAB3F2D4085AC7053F03CBDD70
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
0x9177F308926ECEE6E73BE3BC1A164839
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
0xCE5A09F0E85AA5D57E7A88D28D3510F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
0x4EB59D992A19B209C606B487AD9288B8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
0x5E2BCFD27E6648A89D83383EACC22082
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
0x735238A1C65AEF3676187C6D29B54B0F
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
0x6E7100353F44741C367D78BAF047F293

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
0x40809AA2D5685AE45ED8592F8F3F4DC0
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
0x52B7F9071ACE1E219BD8E0431F807382
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
0x80FFD46974099B9787FB4D52CFD5EF8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
0x810509CBD3F299BAB725028574583A92
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
0x14C50019BF14092CB05BDE34EC28E317
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
0x43396FA126E2195CD9CFB765D524F57E
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
0xFA6CA60195093D6F9E34C8060A3A2146
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
0xB42475C4922C9B4759516E61A300C253
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
0xD7B17A6C16F70935C16CE05DBDBC3804
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
0x04A899F48DDF7590112CE15B7FBB7BB1
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
0xFEEB93C17FC02289254D5CB2F3891BC1
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
0xA31157A3B2C00C69483D94D97B1224CF
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
0xC4727FA026F290413B0198CFEBA83D0C
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
0x0B8AA35C056EE36E8DBEF26E93910AE4
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
0x1A28EB2BEAEC2920923CB3B4D00404C5
enjoyment.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
0x89E30E364DAB4679789A09A02157D3AF
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
0x18DA3930669D753C26FCB0BF0E6EA65D
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
0x9E7B4DFAD6285135DE801E488C047193
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
0x86CB5F301B682EED522A512CB1311F7C
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.

"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
0x909F244ABEF43C1BCBD994CB513EBF69
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
0x434EABA2050A1BC3200A7EA79491E9E9

"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must

thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
0x383F5C652B37451C6F83E6161F5DB130

other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
0x319B3438B4E5BDB77B07DC01C54D1FC6
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I

0xDE40ED77D3F5DA0DA50A7AC9F9600B76
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
0x162E6C11577DD20C08213D6677FDE2B3
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
0x34F46CC7B070D8DC3E8D64E045B0F569
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,

though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely

superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about

conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an

of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it

"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my

inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
0x2608B9D04206A6C8CE89678DA5B70A58
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
0x363A5DCC79488ED0E2DCD4417FA9D26C
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
0x554FEB4D0F7B87C438C25FD257C0A7A0
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-

feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I

what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and

admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your

tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
0xA26C8F5B1F2AA6EEE3CA26DB02980D79
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
0xD87F864C69720174B432EE722EBFF6A3
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my

I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I

used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task

was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
0xD0D435DBA4059FAECBE71C840495314F
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
0x2B21616C81669A759DFF5EA524FEB647
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
0x4A303AE392DDB690DFB91CC3218DEA06
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
0xE7FD74294A603B927D57640D3A47FFED
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
0x3A1A4F2EF7912907AB6D67CCFD87A719
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
0xEDB6483D9D4AB980330A5FA02F07960F
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
0x90D7E1FDE6FA079BBF005DA1114F7A45
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn

out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
0xB3398AB7EAF6DE8322C1EB18C699FF1A
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
0xC51ED4D5BEE04F7B038223446782C1F0
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
0x16F5E7C9E7A4452E882D0464A8B95DD5
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
0x9612607A224511B50F0123F2CD17CF3B
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
0xCC1138BFEE755C8FDAD28D594B5D937E
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
0x43E8C2B84A0CDA38E5C15992CC1CA108
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
0xB497FA41DB806B9D9307355B133B08A2
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
0x17BACA261106D4FB0CED47C0A74F6691
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
0xFECAA186956B3FBB17BA8241A8EA16A5
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
0xEA8E61E51C68C781DBEEF68BD5B29355
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
0xA50C8F6445D52E984CA76A066E436AFA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
0x85B9D8C66A93A79CEEAD234B58EFE87D
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
0x9B22CD0A0A199222529D922EA525ABF2
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
0xCDC0055F8D6C85ACD94A1E9EEB8CF703
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
0x018A05D7E060621A8629F591D6A68973
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
0x4B95A579167373FBB2DFC28C6F15139D
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
0x44E55E3BF68A532EC66202571B03350D
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
0x3FBDDC52CDA4D7A820D5A8AA83A64954
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
0x5296A2DCEE836E9EE4419DF61CBEEBD2
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
0xACAAA979C50171B4E2D9317B95B5021B
girls.

asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
0xB7B04FC5B3B737BEC75827F825E0AA5E
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
0x96340C70BBD1F1050BB88A8A9344726F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Doubtless."
0xA526A6BC7D62969343C670257BFE3CCC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
0xF006BFE3F55959C89272E86BBD2D547E
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
0x5F04ACF133E051CBD31A30E7C00EE39E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
0xF5A2848A1DDB4E3A701ACA68EFDDD1E0
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
0x8EF181582570B97D0282C88A1060C127
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
0x74B394AF86931EAE81708408DAB72D30
it and disposed for full holiday."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
0x55758A2BD67D3DFF52611F294301DB79
What are you going to do?"
0x29881B17986946852408BFF3A9B957F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do you want her?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a

week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
0x7555FD0D9E1586FF58F2DBF0EE047A64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It

is better so: Hannah shall go with you."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite

you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are

my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of

will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
0x3672199E5715AD496143FB81ED8F4836
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
0x7AA176C541580DF0F81F64DFEB42FF39
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as

St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust

that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
0x558BF8EB4E05505BDFB94430BDF4A787
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.

0xC4DE4161F22DD82420419EC4AF09B918

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for

the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
0xFDDA3956150EA4FE465521D0A64226D2
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
0xA62D37AE2FC68CFA2B56FDC887C73D95
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
0x42E1D23E2960B925CDD19B1E8AFB18CB
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your

0x6DE614249B86558896D9CB69062B5D86

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
0xC4E68B9A251576FCD99C0540E70BF2D2
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
0x8AC9950616F118088E83226AD7228E9F
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
0x99A74F053CC2E61B359988DCD262F6F1

"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to

your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
0x21C0F8AC4F93C6425D71D7C4B4892B1D
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
0xBD0160E317EE6969735D52974FCDEB71
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
0x3938494FD11268BA5DAE4C582FA2484E
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
0xD9B965FFAA80C0C22F4E8188E2FBD87E
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
0xECC18305B748431EAC0511DFA24EBC99
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
0x23E2925B92BDE27C02485EA1F916FC22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
0x43F0B116437A0200236FBFDC81C5E6FB
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
0x28BF299BF40ACCC56A0CA46E82DA6DC3
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
0xA29E52687D413B34234860A36B735DE5
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
0x6BD6579889A1519088B50E8523C89898
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
0xBC977E19A6619E3989FF623C3932FE99
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
0xCB3262D7CDF9FAE834ADC8985A925E94
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
0x9F8D3299B64B67140FFB198E3B52BA0E
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
0x2C59EDB46CEE2DC755D558A31100AAC0
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
0xF6B8C35246839AEC8ECDF39A2E02B4A2
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
0x4686AB6C466433EBAC24C740648617FC
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
0xF90CB7F9FE51BF52D7C7FFFE6E73B2C8
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
0x995C48D86706DB6AFD455DCDB5214714
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
0x538C0FDD65A842EEB2CF494813E2555B
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
0x490EF77EE34A1B7D30634B6472C977B2
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
0x5C1D7A424270E55C5C4A6B27ADFFF69C
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
0xDAD04F250991EE269D43713E9749E0DF
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
0x2C64A913D196FC1E92F40A631788B9F1
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
0xBDBC059900132CF4429BFDD586E4C71E
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
0x83D4C4DD78E63CC37D5D0ED6E2865B0C
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
0x884CE0257B7C7235FA09F01DA6C74F16
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
0x0C1A556568121C5357E2E67697CCE629
without.
0x5C765BF76E834074A249FD0BDF7FD959

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
0xF1DB694F0146FC1CA9A6F1606D90F7CA
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
0x59BF069A124641099F75A22EE2D2951B
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
0x3E543DDCD06CB0A868E8C723BE1537AC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
0x3445093577A881890679E3BE345A2359
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
0x37496F1278CF671E3B5BC0481FC35FCF
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
0xDB4C49CEFC8F7559AEE705C46EBFC3B3
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
0xB320E3C4955630AA0CBDCBC8927786CE
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
0x0EDEABE576780AA15C255FAD306337F5
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
0x380C5BCC364D6F6C6F9CC85456064309
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
0x24602E998F2420AD550C81142D97C719
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
0x6E346F64D5B195B35A2A85E118164F05
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
0x834A7672AB99A3AECA7505B4E631D11B
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
0x2443841FD485BF3D9D39C845C9CA5D8C
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
0x8AF0BC5110B4FD7CD63E8B2CE452718E
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
0xAE21EDA034FBC5D4551B3F2A6C0105E8
improved aspect of his abode.
0x94CAB51C9788C01321A2008824998C96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
0x5270E0B7CCA764AE3587C01E945C627D
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
0xF2693DFA5F7E4875ECAB8CA5D1BF510F
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
0xEF5556BD8A2D55E1102B1ECF6E5B118C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
0xE9CCBA06D24627B3900BD0B80DAF1C4A
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
0xCC45EDA7B6F7A25343E26807668130EA
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
0x3D7F0A0300DC536171028B606711E54A
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
0xFE118D8D26CDF38EB923D2D21F1AE6A6
could I tell him where such a book was?"
0xB4B01C318EE9DBE8B9F91FAF154E9B01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
0x30C5BF1EEC791A581C924F830D62411B
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
0x8A5504A7CAA8CD58922EC8DC2BEF883E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
0xC542E67EABA384E84D9C158C048978C2
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
0x0E7EA5A61DFDECEB9CBC763A053D2940
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
0x9583AC5910377C76149864ECE9B4720B
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
0xCCDB71F8A1517CC05572DFF3EF7EFFAC
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
0x91252249158E7E5742D8C9DDFA2EC893
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
0x0B7F4FE648F31EAC4E17B102CE5CA0EA
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
0x00B6777850BEBD5DC0D3B27233C217DE
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
0xC0073E491E3171B1E28754ECC767EC3D
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
0x37E9C77F45A7738AC1B4B40EF9B97DA5
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
0x3374BBD7CBB3E13946061D3D2692D244
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
0xD19654A4A0B3E3ECFB3093F2B55034A6
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
0x19768FDBC804634D6D71D04048768272
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
0x4FEEF23D6AED9399E74FEFD5CF2A2E41
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
0xB43B2E37EC175B6FD6B8BD2214C4C560
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
0xA3419D4AF688E21CA6320C83EFF9AF39
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
0x2E098BB64B0E67987CBD12759B1114D1
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
0x0F90F54A9B38271959E6ED211BF9F889
column, gloomy and out of place.
0xCE3CD261D07B130393095A66D93ECAB9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
0x5E03E5197324A00755815FEF8ED5F63E
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
0xA63184379F669E057B655C09F510CD52
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
0x1A7A5A026BA78BA4954FEA02B4361F94
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
0xEB5A10017CBEC8F8A84FD4CF2384941F
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
0xB6BF2D7DD8118D19BB9449EE65E6F14A
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
0x6C3FDA889822C471CAC207ED11B07324
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
0x40E6528401B98C1407386EDA131A09C0
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
0x0A1A9AFA89465501DBCE220588BDFC06
career--I see it now."
0xA2960291612CF4B3B1E179E271224559

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
0x8B3EF9AADA32CFB7B0055EF2BB46C420
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
0x7753466D0D514CD399ECD13C769E792A
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
0xBE0ECA65A49DBA75FDA61A2B835D81EE
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
0xA69C7B41C7DE8887991F3345CFEA3C0C
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
0x2CCE6AD38EEBCC292118C2CB402C084C
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
0x0F387AE70BF3E5862215A9AA1A646340
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
0xCBE97B8B229B2527AD3B8F0FA639B1E1
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
0xB62F8324980BA3BAD4AFD54C2DE8DD42
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
0x36C47756EFD661C126EE0C47188B066C
into the house.
0x097DC64459698DCB4BE0012122AD2761

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
0x144A0AA1A5E0FA3E1AEAE3E11D20D837
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
0x5AD273E306E5F5F3B266171B54AAC412
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
0x39B1E6D818053C1D42F27CDED37CFDEE
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
0x2DD57E397F512DE389E3764A351708DC
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
0x9BE4D9496AEC797A6D2F8DA935EF96D1
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
0xF3A6A362E3D23850120809C08614DDC2
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
0xF446B1035F768281CC503DADC0BC25D9
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
0x252158CDE13364105F0021F35494DED0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
0xD7E792200F12298F40D8667E09043F42
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
0x6DA0551337B2ACBFD33EBCEB7317E03F
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
0xB071E5C7505823AAF8262391F562BEEB
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
0x856B012BF5C95A919AEDC8CEF11546D5
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
0x0B009A893129D66C7CC44A13D56FDF06
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
0xB7070F35CE791D55F4238FDBA82761EB
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
0x601E08952E64408A5FA326022D069FB6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
0x3124E89857285F5DC4E5F44C9E6809F9
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
0x3C5C46A09064BD5EA8C5E7A2200C80EF
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
0x3A39AB28DB402CBAEDF6D541689BB2F4
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
0x08DC20A469EB68A343A41DAD9C9D30EE
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
0xD7999A957DFAE6F0331E4C687BD2F330
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
0xAEB674D9E126D1DBC4A52A3383432A21
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
0x4206A5BE9C9E32E847818EE94AD873F0
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
0x8DF2194C8446BAD026B6B2081FD8B854
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
0xE32B7D945512F814B89A443C7AB9580C
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
0x9376F41846F44D4145F1E132C6A72984
mother, who was drawing away."
0xA6B86139C5064DAFE2578FCCC6DD2783

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
0x6B8D751BF25AC9ADA9A111CA19276E6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
0x1AEDABA4785F1160A5602B5A1E7C58FB
the way."
0x2AE04152DA64DDA3DBF1479DC7D5E21F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Tell him I will go."
0x8E75E72734A87D15DB9AB95B50C51057

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
0xF69086EEE33B6C2788FD1B2920E3CD94
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
0xBEF756925F96493CE98EE58274A4CE12
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
0x454D8A6DB5017F6A14FCF9874A89DFE4
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
0x5B2F9993C29BF5EE88B60846C6277646

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
0x85E09C54067A5BD3E13D3315748D4618
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
0x17CE9AEB1DD13B3DE808569D57DE1E6C
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
0x23277A30F22B9A6952CA70AC749CE187
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
0x953C5B42FA9EAF6953B8928B784C6C37
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
0x7C4A3728298615D057D86A4F0F394A32
with himself.
0xCB1ED000BCD32170F82BECDBF970E7F5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
0x7EFA9A7A330A574E0865FA843387B136
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
0x0FB9FE97141E1D8B4FB59D66CF9E28CC
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
0x89F785AF3F4DD031DDA01B7AEEC5F478
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
0xBB26643E2E94F48E17FE7F33675385EF
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
0x2CCE8534BAB547908EC4575BA76977DD
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
0xAB60439606ACD68C8BCA7036CB5987F0
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
0x0DF64122BFFAA6E32C13321A2DD90B64
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
0x2F631472BC3E2E3CDF31F61E75E31801
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
0xBF7C5790870A4D8ABD15EAB56D2CCDF5
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
0xA229F6E48F23311C7F364AA94836D7B3
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
0x6C3A177B43910AABA375227913E87C80

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
0x2EFDFED0ACDE0D3E8E0256C935DB104B
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
0xA25C0A07BC894AFB5FAF7223DD8F696B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
0x175E2EE88BF39F0F32001177DFB77EDD
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
0xA3D4D32EE9BD708496B5B030708E9DA3
ensuing year.
0x612F9A76D9D4157F11F46F31315D0A82

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
0x22DC3AE3174DA5EA89A9870C3F51FBF0
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
0xEA9C7CD887F73DA60D692EF2526584C0
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
0x82014D0D300F871F6A9FEB1C3A6A5922
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
0x97C899EAA0CEDEC07886EA4B02B43F3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
0x26D98B7A576028C90C1377C716916ACA
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
0x22F091BAFD28F323ADFC2FEC633582E5
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
0xA3BA051FE089AE43AB0E98E14E409B84
yesterday."
0x9C65D0CF7B33FA425B559FC635237590

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
0x1D549FCDB145DC8A3F96C329A2AEB64D
he was serene as glass.
0x9B6E2A38A17FFE4AADA97EB7703FDC62

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
0x52E47FB2EB843CA3FE17A4EF254B9AD3
known each other long."
0xB3DDB6CD8E5EC7A4BC60785C79FCFF10

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
0x6F334035BE8127AB3ABF34EAD5A3E25E
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
0x84CCCFF6119BD4078446912E3AF5BA6C
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
0x1A13DEB938488D8297E6E2C79E5E30FC
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
0x60873664D8644D56D5D060C7327B3107
can he refitted for their reception."
0x87A20C352C65CF653D232E2C7BEAB318

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
0x43708712D51C685211B881F6899AD791
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
0x299D4484068D52F5F02A6EE6FE92AC03
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
0xD673C8922857F5F5DA83C4CD20E5C89A
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
0x1017D56FD90206F1D9A8243CB14CF0B8
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
0x13256EF8062674C573C49F30EFDA2078
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
0xF1F928486616DEE6C3CDE6744A05046E
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
0x23E5F6A81C80EBD2E57FBC5FFF68C44A
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
0x6BB5DE7D4A89ED902A80083146FF3B1B
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
0xCCAD49796A538F89796C80700B581402
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
0x4F245A280441B11E238BEAB27D7DBF01
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
0x0C0B7416F55A3753C5C02A4A614E3AA1
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
0x8FE64AFF73C093BEA5A246B823DABDCF
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
0xA64F55E6B679945FE701100E7FD7A3EF
frigidity.
0xA4719C0F333B78377137DA7C86A07FF6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
0xA58ED5FC274DDAF2899FFACA26613950
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
0xB9A171B5D1523867FCBCA9078AB93A78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
0xCB52B6812F99F1983CD81A01FD13440A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
0x3A71AD0E392F3ED183A68F35B8AEB087
moment's hesitation I answered--
0xB2D2DD662C1471E528859CC07470E3D6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
0x5849E84CB351234F6FF960E50DBCCFFD
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
0x5A33182CAA99569BDB427BF283113807

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
0xBDD23E1BF3E36673B6C985A329275B43
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
0xD3C943DEC17D9540567C4FBF5C16C6DC
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
0xE3F2B8D830F1D1E57DD8D18C83330D38
returned to his papers and his silence.
0xBE7CD9BA15E94397DA0061724F33DA25

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
0x69D7E7964E482025EAC1F61F355B6BD4
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
0x566BC0F47C37E20A5A6375E74CD30A01
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
0x2D0021FB68973B88031E90736D6E4BF8
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
0xCFB4851DA4E5FC44030D10C144CF29D0
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
0x7442664EA8BBABA0E654214EBD15F00F
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
0x1CEEB0D6FFB022FD218B1E1B80903D7B
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
0xD8C7457F56637B1239DE3CAE084906B0
plans.
0x00DE04C900DE04C9C622B2F4974B4506

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
0xC65EEC6AEAFC19D6C2E58260C885EEF2
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
0xE49886D5C0EF6590FFDA0DCB97195D8B
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
0x1FAAF4BA77169BDC29CC68E90E21498C
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
0xF062A79D7105F26056244D07075A694F
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
0xCB99ACCC928CB838348690B7C22E4951
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
0x1D7051B580CD71060273C304B7B7F8FB
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
0x06118705682959002C3D9527471CC77F
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
0xEBFFB7BD8DEE3360303777DDF39B93B2
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
0xCBA9A27BFE6B7DCDBF5856C38304FB0D
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
0xDCFB687DA6845EAA008FDA4340B0184B
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
0x5F53204D915D34D3CACD0450CFA0E349
the task without regard to the elements.
0x101581F7626C0535A9E42115AEB2DCF6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
0xE0FA43A35A661CEA9795A7D85934A39E
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
0xC42395E2E791FB914E5F584DCBD7DEAF
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
0x0FB297C66E6C709AD88FD1C63BA09C21
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
0x7BA9E10953A2BC1CFC7CAD7D48131AB8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
0xE63A41125CA06EA68ADB30DFCC57F403
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
0x71B0028CAEA80312289EE05119FAFF3A
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
0x60F9082FDEADB0F32E850FF2F670C3D2
was a special annoyance.
0x0F47D11796A43168E219A5879A534E10

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
0xFF9D5E6E7725A8F78619212282ECDE7E
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
0x49B77FD91A697D470BDDF99559AE5997
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
0x92256263D69D69585E61DE1712745542
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
0x8EB5528C67DB5766E6CA4219BEDD9CCD
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
0x16DD46093140900D6C426A2A325CACFF
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
0x9486590523D3037F3DD2F1864BE4AB7F
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
0xB83DE6C0379877369BEF6708AE1A5920
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
0xA5326A001ACA1447929A236AC99795B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane, what are you doing?"
0xF68537ABA3F2F345C04ED2879DC304B0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Learning German."
0xC1394274B9CECFEF90FBD5DCC4D321A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
0xFC9E2E4F706339F60B986722F2345476

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are not in earnest?"
0x314077DA3D959C580CF207D995210F01

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
0x954242E91E430A7269418C5EC10482B6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
0x62D97841051199ABAF3EDF8D811B0D25
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
0x9E9D972AB4A1F43604C66465732634B9
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
0xAD974941D0A181EDD53FF7F5C3D8C037
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
0x1BA135D9E1C2E1EB210C018D7966506D
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
0xF5883691A4A667E744E18F12F593B1E4
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
0xFC47324C55F8D2F001CFED3349373C73
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
0xC08928DFCF171822409B8186C19F2FEF
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
0x1DB8BE0B1143E4DB3BAD4D81D56A4742
barely three months to his departure.
0x767A3D1A72ACAEEC0E373E90CBB36A8E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
0xFE61BA55F9376FFC271F493E9978F3F5
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
0xF33398460F394FED9E61B8213E4F4585
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
0x4770CEA466D1C5B007461EF64ECADFEE
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
0x014CD7B27CCBD431EBC1842143E20356
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
0x5BA39D3F134F87C79255100688B1881F
such a step.  He answered quietly--
0x3CF3B25450417B61B800032635FC572C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I know it."
0xE95A8F025221A15B5330B4EDEDD22E0E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
0x2DE33CC74267B421671CAFEB02DB6EC2
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
0x0536C3110A216B731971C6D4C8E98442
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
0xC11E3629A14B3A788CA803D48C29497B
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
0x458E9454A650981A0B817697A2120A37
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
0x9E9A949E961223F64641858023E273B0
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
0x6328120A43A9623C24944E3000488FB8
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
0x4035D221151F99EA85DA70ABEF1E73BA
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
0x6299D8B3D2037244069C61C1C26C7824
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
0x6B0608DADE82FCC052BB9F58ECBA046B
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
0x2F633DAD955FBC2E30A570DA42072D52
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
0x35B4BA93E34DAD6A2C8EF83C98B634C0
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
0x50514F5D99FA598B01BDCB34EF1AF6D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
0xF5FF1C1C5C5871AF25067AE7DAF77AA5
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
0xB3594AB853F2605DB55F222AA8B7E4BC
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
0x16B014A2F5354E6139FD3ADF1B7DF77A
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
0x67A6A9C2DB264EED7D11F6536056A5A8
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
0x4209BA2F5D60CE973E6AA8655F8F1D0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
0xF834567360F1A569487621CD9DCC3A9B
her as such: you should kiss her too."
0x3FAD74C5DEC7E9083F9318BCB08BE03C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
0x825F253E7F90C94ADC3463364A805E33
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
0x7910FC8A1B6E64CD3454F57B1579AD3B
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
0x46B9E89D255625A2367718DD8B637BC0
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
0x42875D16B2DEDE1C7C616B7B35759399
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
0xBE69E11BE1A33A28EBBCE6A891E21AAE
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
0x729D2F3F44FFF12829B67A20B6FD5915
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
0xE22EC1257C1060B3E1C22C0C125C7F16
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
0xC5818A3AFDA3BDAF815EA8DF8E2A6301
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
0x89D16B45949277F19F64B5CDA3D5E12C
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
0x36E8E6CF5A220FD01AAE73A4FCC2B198
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
0xC05120D30E4992F3AC404E34FAD6383B
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
0xB337E799F656A6CC0E3C32248C7B6B35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
0x021DB788D634595B75EBE07508A1FE4F
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
0x1D474061D549D48A634B2441EB5152FA
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
0x387174B0B0C53D867C6E50FF3F4B5DD9
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
0xB8E3E22475E01F186C84D1E98C8B1BE0
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
0x18717F2D18BA8A196612B9E3EDB36B2B
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
0x652B7465D084BFF4713159AD9D84DEFB
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
0x84DF471F3A78E25FEE705193BAC129D5
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
0x6DC649A0B75888FD6952047AEDB31B10
own.
0xD5F68AF0D5F68AF03D6CC3C52F27C3C9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
0x5B68EF449E5259167CB17084F9E9DBEB
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
0x8CDD60DDA6316A1AA966E6F6847C766F
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
0x64FD95E2C42D007DE2F8F177C8C0738D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
0x92EFBEF8BF5334C88EF9C40A4EC81972
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
0xFD19F0335A96B3F8FA8F9C411CED7542
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
0x0FEE29185319064BD9BB8838A0787D34
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
0x3E41213EF0CACD997FA214C557C582DE
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
0x5ACBA5EA374B4F27551C2CFE4F4D9516
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
0x1F76E2503105D25DC93B0D9E6262C2DC
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
0x5BFF10660206D057FF2E48F2CA2DE248
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
0x941A00C895BD5AAFB586F96A0FD57096

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
0x28F4423D35372886A60124FFC7746909
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
0x4C90FE3EE62A26F2D7B7CE5F5DE550F1
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
0xD09D8017DE9191599FAEBC6F0260164B
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
0xBE5784A379649C71B2E5F64331FAA658
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
0xFBCF171B9CBBD1A34759B4AD0270F677
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
0x558D3457845B2FCF482993E3D1DC3CEB
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
0x7CBD61FEEF92F2A1BD34340DCDDA9E7F
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
0x649F5B60E6A78F007353058D8ADCFE13
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
0x5EDA717D88E25BE001D16CB0C3684180

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
0xC17F73F8EA0579136CB387EA87EA1D24
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
0xB4D40DE355ECD243079101ABEE779EFA
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
0xDEB1472447CA6CB2E05C4345A24B779F
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
0x3E6879476F51CD12E2D283B32E74E2DC
then I felt dark indeed.
0x3C69571A1397B46337941CB824B4A1EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
0x70D2D75251D1B516BD529153153BB44E
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
0xACFD9436E43D335644365503F176B91F
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
0x9611BE7982158367A12CB7F073DFA24E
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
0x35573C2081E97DA8DAC42110450F268D
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
0xF006B1A64497DDA0EB0028462E7A5B67
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
0x74856019171AB6C9683A9C3866D5940E
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
0xD48BAE2F760DCE229C2FE363848B860A
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
0xBB638C84602CA778B1ED73AC89BA6C67

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
0xBAC25BA8063B8B11149D8A1CFE134474
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
0xBA96565A4D902341873EF3DECE4B0A02
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
0x1C02ADABD40FF0D3086880C08B766C92
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
0xC8F33F9FEB59CA2E89629EE49A9A215E
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
0x4F0C02C336B39096737CC7D437B7E1CE
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
0xF7C0A7DDD6BB57418A5E7D9BE55CDB87
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
0x44131333A5907331EC7B28305D3C0A28
eyes filled again.
0x15B5A363D0042A9116D8FCEFE8CE033A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
0xE182DFE498A2A05632F6A0FE7AD8ED15
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
0xFD23A27F91908B4EE409B7FF57083CFF
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
0x5B74EF8C0400EB2DE35A4692733E81CA
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
0x71257D900E49E00F590F76E76E546D25
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
0x2F5A31382AA4358C52AF8BD4A6DA74F6
as to its cause; he only said--
0xE2FACCF9FE59B6F069C41B577C7D7A97

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
0xE4E4465D0BB1E9F7D70297F9019CDCAE
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
0x62A5FD39481AC862A961112408DCF90B
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
0x9B2A56C24E7D058D3E24615180246B8B
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
0xC2BB2EF45BA96B2BB591159B53ECD275
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
0x04692770CFCD88140630BE7E6D614DF1
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
0xBB252659333A73056B22DEFD3BA6C6E7
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
0x2D5DC74A0A40BD307A05AE0F3E2F3E70
said--
0x86CA0DB586CA0DB5502F29F4A081027F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
0xAB5FF7AF3DE69E3E38EE23DDAFFAD1D5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will call Diana and Mary."
0xDFE7009401B4605B889890E3C62B8393

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
0xBDBE21747FA16CBA45C51F495FD1591C
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
0xCAC19A627A6052B447332BB5B90D273F
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
0x203EE8C497CEF12D6A29B4E5F1E8658C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
0x5CBD7AA94A5C0E49CC978B1CB4F78210
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
0xD1CD9BB3EDCB0585CE6CEEBABC23BC91
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
0x7FC72B7AE13FB38CD42A073D0C2905D1
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
0xF5400A5A21D099FF3BCE3A645740AA88
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
0x1BC775872E99AF7F8B3963A0A44A4214
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
0xA66959922A733B481080C21380CD81C3
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
0x3633AA35A1FC9E73648D71BC1D8EEDFF
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
0xCB9199C5F55053AF1540B3548938921D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
0x97D8E8F58EE372621BE3C0206E7FE77C
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
0x76F6BDEA2121F4BC1BE02B382127EB80
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
0xBDEC3F59874CFF9CEC3DCAC52736766F
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
0xD988E100222C4286C3DE174A2EE43F13
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
0xB9BE78360C36C512E1162C725B40F28C
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
0x3C9364FB78060B9D30A3A953AEE844FD
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
0x06934FAC10AA78E76DDE4CBDA012AE19
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
0x0AF91D0E404DD0963BB10CB9EBAF8983

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
0x0A55A5863B044311206C37C036B4EAFF
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
0xE443B5FEBF30DE7BA1CA317A5C221AEF
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
0x8616A9ADFA4F1151AAA79295112C10B9
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
0xC9189FE20089D9D2693EF902595262D1
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
0x723DE13923A4F165942193B176289AE6
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
0x391C161F38F602B94881F736295A8C0F
last refuge for silence.

I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
0xB219F9B9EF58412AC152B37C3FBCBF13
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
0x670B6455C77D9EF4F7BCF9EE12CC3EB8
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
0xC22902CF3F0FC55AC0163D81D548EAF9
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
0x63174AF8D71C5C434A91EB8F660C0A81
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the

0xFB4A00B3361A03DBFA381A4C979707A3

Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
0xF211DC07FA72203AB36CF46C230A71C1

"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
0x872086559FC5908B64B017B1D4E78BB1
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
0x960CD73502FBE3321AB48284E87911A2
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
0xCC7DD287C0CDBE7CFC21F2111BBD6D3F
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
0xBD8065C25613A6232C900349E59FBB1B
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x981ED0C655A9B0E2C7767987582D27AC
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
0xF696B12FD311B886865CB45636526436
rivet the spell.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
0x57E14C16B8861CBB48265929F60DDEC1
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
0x6BBB12C7A84CDBE32FCDF51E38F9A3AB
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
0x4D1D4359C410DFCC6E60B06C2512484E
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
0x0099A25AAB3575DA4EBA3B3A4AD2963B
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
0xF6C37C9399E2195391CFB2F5938CB1DF
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--

"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
0x6E17CD3EAAFDA22BF6FD6EAFD9B276B0
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
0xAB3651EBAF8D0A6CFCBF6D26A4536289
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
0x5601729A8D495C01131A415546657755
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
0x8456E7A245891156F6583C13F5D801EC
service."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
0xFAA464D128D839B1D13598AD9ECBF781
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
0xE54BC82AF3EC9D0074DCB19DDC7FB46C
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
0x24695F1C2A288A4505462B7E04F21616
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
0x391FEAF3FEC14F986CEADB83A56DEF38
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
0xBDDB2C560B2E491C6C0BB13B2B96B50C
for him.

"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
0x433DACACC177568AAE3EA84C5187A007
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
0x8F6228244D456AA53EA5E4B54D5BA9BD
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
0x28C596042DD584CB7EC90078D8637AB8
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
0x95553A63CAFA449CA0DAD4C156C20960
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
0xEDF7DF6FA877DF5F99E2A3818EBEBDA0
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
0x4BE8D5DB23508584414476B3010AD70E
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
0x31E377A65B3ED87777BA1AA8DD44C42A
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
0x3365B7E427AED33B94FA722786E7D6E3
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
0x5181E287F05D9040DB4766364FE748BE
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
0x877BA77D219486F140C12FECC6BFE252
bear the weight of your human weakness."

"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary

labours."
0x8807364A8B35FB147391D0165BFFCD67

your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
0x84349C234F7799FD29E495D2B7397163
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
0x8EDE9D24BB7D3611A54F1B812741005D
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."

Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light

kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
0xF48BE62FD24FBBB8A4A0AA68F8F1E0B7
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
0xCD3D89823CECF3458233BDC1464F60F5
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
0xC077E1F1E23C77264B40A33DE81C0CA2
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"

"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
0xF321DE7C11711B59BC0DE9C1D650C454
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
0xED8F06D999470F32989D13A5E154D6D2
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
0x9770429B107F69E7887608D145F1DD85
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
0xB930F9D883796E11BC2A78F9A2226B10
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
0x0418598BC2EDF63D81FF852D37E245CF
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
0x1F5B0906592A6551198A76ECB07DCABE
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
0xB1651473FC2CEC1A8D958EBA700A7C90
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
0x053103E0C5DB25F310684A2CAEB3C7BE
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
0xD9E407CB0CF63E17A97383533A516EC5
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
0xC5FC6931A4C22FA5A15A17745CC72E1E
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
0xFFCD49C846A2ED005BFC2FA4E35DDAFA
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
0x765A06291D8D789A95CE206FD0A1B380
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
0x150D57A8E04EDEFF2E037B8AA2751977
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
0xC509B15DB76D5E4A0485E5B9F0571A37
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
0xBD81A70F63D454155D1EEB10BD021D6B
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
0x96CBE13496294E47A750FE146A56DA41
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
0x41EAD6ECC2F80F33E478E004FBF69F90
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
0x9DAFB62AC5B464309531B66B2441CEE7
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
0x69045B32CD7396E95FBA90E22B6A2B6E
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
0xBCB9DEC0DDE1CEF2ACD09C36FA8C6423
be to me invaluable."

My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
0xB87DF48DE035051C1D844FB278FB4287
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
0x341B4D87CD185DF95FD5007DC06AB29B
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
0x5561571D27EDD2454ADA4F9074BF1FC4
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
0xC7631323EE4F85F3A1D3554283DF8C9D
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
0x78CF5400DE69060C8B7FF5286D96DAF5
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
0x436DE3249D702C75D767488F23777384
think, before I again hazarded a reply.

"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up

the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.

"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge

that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is

not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
0x0F68C7BDD1252598CCAB6C65F6AECCF7
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
0xFEDE010F370F8A2228BE7046DA871DE9
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
0x838D4FBC991D45FC2CBE92148FF118EA
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
0x554F77FA8AC33D0633625AA911012F67
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
0xC1ABD788515A392FFB06489E4792D785
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
0x915D5DFC1B2F16F9EC2A58D5A7D18073
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
0x2D5F8E8BDDC0A8C7DFA06800ECC45E68
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
0x771CA4042536290EBB7999BA72F681D5
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
0x156DC45595563A90CA89968202716767
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
0x1DB4C1AD45FFDC5C8672DFE788BD7C5A
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
0xB4170AB3BBF8C629548E370D3B49F659
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
0x12DEE60995A2B4814B3868074B6AC300
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
0x661ED5642F325763F745AE5B90931FEC
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
0x5563E1527A087A0E44EBFAFB229D60F7
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
0xBE35C7A0B5372DF434CDA9E97CE3A1B3
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
0xB5684B38A42790E4CF50AD58AC32EBC8
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
0x46760D1313E14822CF76B294D143AF5A
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
0x2BD18056F66CD304E84C7E887C8210A5
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
0xBAF3B7E60249CFED7AB337E9607FCE2C
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
0x722A8CDFEA88585F0A1EAEB7932A6102
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
0x3D4F3CFA50609D90F1BEFE5E02EA37CC
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
0xB72750965AC0847852969BD85CFE81BE
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
0xA1E0336A60DCA32CE370CB18D73D93D6

item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
0x13960907D96CD44246F2C43EA977B738
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
0xF33DE569F88192F92AEA4A0218BF7B4D
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
0xB54C15BDBCC2903173BDA9E9D67478D4
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
0x2A262E06E19CE770BDA0AE59C8B548FA
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
0x1B8ED60235C6A00927093990BEDB9F33
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
0x86A44BB182802A97FAFF8508A21EB449
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
0xFE51C1A9A63BE8A2FE0242B65253A6AD
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
0xBC3FD7C756DA20364E4FDC75504A62CC
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
0x9AE340C9E1DCD91886A1A555AD8C851C
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
0x4DAB0B256B6B7F6BE865FD431FDB42FB
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
0xCE14ED4FA9D678EAF822F1FB8A974434
I will tell him so."
0x465BBA28BA2ED32D936BC0F837ACBBB3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
0xF591E45F3BD44B681BDCD174641CF4F5
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
0x8E5EB56B16A4224D6DA8A5701931247F
his feet and approached me.
0x125A046643B4BF0F6F7AAA5508D30CAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
0x514E3EAD315B1A7AE2F408C2435FDF49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
0x5691E79D13CA95AB911DAACA62E91541

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
0x41F9B425AA45A9B71A393C696627DECB
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
0x6920A0BB4B56A505BBD25E155881BF61

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
0x7F515F9B49E374003E0E5E9587815738
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
0xE5623BB61A5595F8B16CB8E65B91A14E
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
0xA530E9C54D68AFDFE11B032C8E97DEF8
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
0x23A1B67A0783608EF7ED5A0E8A20839D
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
0x6E3DFC99BA02B40E88C5AD6DBE4C7700
sense will guide you."
0xB989DDD3FB933856D2FB488231353A1C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
0x0AF7AA3DEA57429DBA269A56C09E4412
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
0x06DF2CF167DC8D7CB98BB167DC8ECD65
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
0xCA8F068B4C9869C809453EA0F8945BF8
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
0xA3BC982397EC0B1987FD1752EE294B94
continue."
0x1A1060B35F205F75E9CDDE679D96F4D1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
0xCA7960599FC518CC5EED97E12815C963
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
0x7C984FD1BCF4CEDDB45AEA2355033828
have said that."
0xF5D8F3D5B754B7ADA4E18CC942E3B261

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Conditionally."
0x75F394F21ADFD3000059376F19E540E8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
0x8F09BBA591A1C1438C6ACE9F8AF882B0
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
0xC334D13CED9B0143E252FB08602CFD82
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
0x641D04D70BE61D81B265CC9CE5CD86D6
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
0xA5406FFBEF2319B4D5A99D19B253DDED
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
0xE56F033F894D22A8458CA1559CFAB1F0
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
0xF18C84901BCCF4B3FB0D5D7E14454534
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
0xFDDEC3296CEF734EFC904F181BC27571
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
0x9BB9FEAA5A2291DA9F041E6B67A4F31D
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
0x1FEFF65CE1D65AED423441BE182A3AED
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
0x371988C002439A41D3A6E946C6208FFD
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
0x6BDA9C9015FEB0D2F07B4A7ABC0D62A7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
0xA38AA686F85FFA48FC88193142A7A86B
my limbs.
0x6DBAA2485D042F56448FFEC67D93AD59

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
0x3D73B3FFB0B5D1BF0748168B5DD6C900

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
0x003D5BB809B82716425F0E9C24FF6773
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
0xA2A226054012816D896DBC25FFAA561B
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
0xE3D03478A462D6C1EC5E99978B6AC5A0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
0x291390F194268119E8F2EDAEFD751396
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
0xA6CA3156F03402D264CD8B8E35BD108C
them he has no use: I retain them."
0x9F76ACD41843E4EDDA61891D906CF107

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
0x3E5599D8F8DD38D5B3544E673A8316F3
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
0xDA377D9156918E32B412E9F0406B118A
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
0x5F7D9BD805B9A4D5F27EFE52A9CFD02F
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
0x06CBAA009EAB36D09737B66F3D9FEDDC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
0xF5981B677A291E0369E6C940733E9B6F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
0x3088B46E461EDC41BBF2AFCF4999CDB3
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
0x0827410D1F7425C3212A1D87E66DB175
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
0xD29C1510FA2C29552C0FF8BA78D92524
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
0x0F611A73C0C3B42964D577EE5E31ACBD
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
0x1C92F7C24E819C57AF9A338963AAC9A0
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
0xDFD3B0357213DECC1E569B5C2D1E252F
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
0x6B5787392EDFCC8087B0D168042829E0
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
0xE3F587D17D0E39BA0AD2CC6EF383B421
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
0x51B110F8A83C4D8751463696ED691CA9
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
0x2A3E128D6CA99703F112FDB2A1A6DDAE
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
0xB6888E432446920B38F6600995F822A4
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
0x7EFA5D72857B0A3A9C7D14AEE34B7B50
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
0xDDF98B724436259FB22FEFA7CE47F7F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
0x0378D60E12C8272DDD34CC66958EABB5
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
0xC7F1AB2396CF5FD66E4A6B55DB07A229

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
0x6143F9C7A28337652B7C0D14DF02ACDF
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
0x80E4DB5FA44479DB7F8C670E928D5627
this signify?"
0xF77695C012A2E979EE14A85BE1379CFC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
0x3251575D6B89908B027D1E3A68980FE8
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
0xF9DF01AB788E8B25F03DA030522B88F2
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
0x14A007BDB97B6B2B28AEC21B8F911C11
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
0x7575A293D0A679B97274BD47F43AE423
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
0x020FCD0C646D46272BA8738615663602
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
0x428BBC44C5606B7635B7FB0259903D0D
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
0x91D73D5FBDA5D6B6584D2F92DC36ECC8
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
0x2B6604ADAE25A1AD6050A3FD8B2370F8
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
0xAE9E34A94DA7332572FE55C98F5F6B3B
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
0xF763364D32520988F0DDEB47F6EEDC1D
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
0xE888A11E51E466E35B0223D6AF64FB12
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
0xC23BC6E94E1E3862A5E789CC580CBB4C
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
0x9553B6AF8C05951CEC087E0508F1DFC5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
0xC84AE0333CECFD0F646ADEA93DC83F2D
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
0x63D9DF339DCC92BC95E467E5E40B1A17
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
0xD46F39C1B671459A0392CEBCA07FC3AF
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
0x207A973908A731B7BFEFE1C4F0F7DFE3
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
0x7B971D41C81F935D5C7D93BDB3FED5CE
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
0x642AF99D511FD49940C5C677809B6420
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
0xE7413AACE0994A20E2F786881AAD125E
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
0x052E858C622EFC203C9FC193390B5B3B
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
0x7AD2F62F5BC2BFF13CEAD8122DD7707C
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
0x523B5CE18DF5724E052F0E8291B595DA
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
0x391C7F6A6465302E1B159E972A811C13
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
0xAA2E62BBBB48E678D19C1F311FFF927E
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
0x52835AE0AE666B29C42778DB9EA09DEA
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
0x16F73B8144599F455282D41A98B45EAB
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
0x6917205096936D0BF20CA428E3433D63
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
0xC6AB0BE91F601AB18C98DFE6E74A91A7
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
0xC5F1AAFFFC49539081A83325AF860C03
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
0xABB1A888D9173B6DE7FC2885EEC84962
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
0x3D0906128DD131BD9479220E5136DF3F
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
0x915019D868EA7968F4FA50F04C39F4C4
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
0x9BD4A723E9850DAD18C3BA67061DCE32
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
0x5C00D7A3876C57C2E6D870A849259898

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
0x9D5CBAD80DB4621EBA7DCBD896218D8B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well?" he answered icily.
0xE2CD761785BD73FD3C878849DA1AF0CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
0x11130CAE97980FC3FE52DF12F4776D82
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
0xEDED1CFD9FA207C48E64EB94D533F930

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
0x88A1E742FEE6CB6C96F899AAA8494562
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
0x181B170DC0D2BE69229219CF626FF437
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
0x157FB78ECEFB98ACC27FB7E271A99C0A
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
0x7C6ED9619AF123DA7C4AD2135E2FECF7
tribes--and unwed?"
0x89823D598E4F76339C1A24F4701E7E66

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
0x7CFF87D672CEA118C390984FE93677F3
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
0x4445606680780239E576B7F4D9D8689D
yourself."
0xCB6D9DE25DB6EFE58E51CDB6DF4C7A9F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
0xB89C1A96B930F3D1ADD78713419E916F
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
0x109D47C4D35DE4F8638F7FEF12F514A3
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
0x8EB76CA69ECC940C156F5E1C5F187C4B
heart and--it would not do."
0xB85C45CDC66E3C76DEC3B7680B8236C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
0xF3E160A719C4075B7700B65B71F6D713
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
0x07CA281086ABBF40CA185B69577C40A6
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
0x9975BE130B2075AEE3C8F18306AF681C
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
0x866B8A2D9FB98C818170B30C424D5177
nothing more--don't fear."
0x47271F51364A9B77D323A6CF19CF94B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
0x35306FC40E59894911207667D4492703
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
0x95771D97DA8DB34C1D1D212735C377FE
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
0x7C989561F702056F3F109AA4BEFD0FA8
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
0x34526D63FBA80A159D8C147F390D32FE
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
0xE4A09BB24A3B7841A60A9F0082BCF2DC
eyes."
0xA171FA84A171FA8415E77E3069B64D64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
0x26C16DE7B287CEFAC47CAA985B5E132A
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
0x02573BCCAB1CB9902453CBBA77EC4071
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you

offer it."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
0xF35BBC053A7FE3A99CEA82F158157688
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
0xBB12D5A2CB25079072243E3890DED0A5
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
0xD739EA009DC7649A33EB8A8464C144CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
0x39541A05E3EAA40A130FB37D21A815B6
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
0x111B2594EF45356E7CA7E49C5239CD3A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
0x1CE314695193A07360163E818848A6EC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
0x4B2094FA73577D38D5A512FD19C1453D
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
0xAB043EFAC3AB30CF54F8EE7998E841E9
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
0xA6FB209E03F23843873C313A89C1381D
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
0x619FC62CDBC5DECF97F7A32656A5505E
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
0x76C77338E681226D00C011FE0C61C41B
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
0x105E257264454BEBA82A2F4D44C4B6FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
0xF35E991C7E175BDCB957F98D0CD7DEAF
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
0x22DDF96E3E6636CCB717F13FF7AEE9ED
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
0xF35EE821348456CADFAE373DC35DED00
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
0xE83266C7114DE4FF6AD7633E4BD792BE
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
0xE014EF3E4AA8EE33C1DD08E9A04C1072
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
0x343392E2850E7D241FB9F4B25844BEDD
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
0x631945436ADC8388C65D33DB975A5F7C
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
0xEF8BC1718FADDB4973C0B545205CCC0E
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
0xB22A4F536132D671A96367DF7668A74D
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
0x73DDCFD756C29D2843F2854854C7EE8C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
0x1833DCE3B73D70FAD2FDE8272A2D2358

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
0x0A17A170B99F52B4A55169371DBE214A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
0xD33A72640D85FB3EE859375969972752
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
0x186B4C3BB12463DB18EF82F454DE90F6
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
0x6E5B51804EE8FBC5017A06C7FB39AECE
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
0x988B1F1A6B2E149D47D6B6FBB5541FC5
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
0xFA588C4B0B0107D6660C3D7D24E43627
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
0xEDE6FC9A1BBE471156DFB4A808F64463
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
0x656528D7C669968D9D0F95E61CB21042
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
0x7DF5E83B23EBAE25DC7F66681F8309E3
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
0xC3D78535F1E850C99E3BD974D25A4812

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
0xBFF3DA1A3FF790B30FCF39B740480D00
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
0xEA9A6FAC73DC5766C1D300E72AADD331
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
0x51FCAD2721D0F3D7B8724FB33AC0A211
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
0xDA75502468F390DF18D518A0E81A3085

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
0x3AB4DFFFB5A67EABBFB6C8DBCC94F555
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
0x46586BC5FD6E582E2233DE379CB81D26
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
0x7DC27D35FBF70829A7B29C86033CBDF5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
0x51444383FC14B5E0365603BEB592A501
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
0xCF74BC095E741900B26276A101BEB64C
stairs.
0x028E5D0F028E5D0FFA7818366E8ED9DB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
0x84FB18269AD73676E436B4E166C8AF14

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
0xA8784778066C068E78498C338DFA2087

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then shake hands," I added.
0xD4B2144237F38AEBA240389DCEC77830

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
0x5E4ED78CA115DEBA897F4633F2A44100
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
0x77BF037217BBED0282DBDFB3D6B984C6
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
0xA32013D88DBF365928F780DBD48C0F73
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
0x42D9643227585271CBC4617574549BBB
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
0xB4E5B14C4DC43074A6D8302E9433370F
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
0x8E99C595D3BEF2390A974BD5A062BE2A
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
0x8568CD34DCD12C26FB452999FB8446C0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
0xF4CA07441338A48E19468D017AB1DC9F
down.

CHAPTER XXXV
0xDEF65ED0BDC4323F951667DF5DE36A2A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
0xCB258E03815873ABC73D042A2CDC9700
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
0x5AD757F4389B8E7CCBFB58D81791BCF8
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
0xCC5803B666A43623041025B0D70FB0B6
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
0x44DEC4DCB66A2A5C783279E7F9919492
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
0x7AD2F120CDA6A0D4396C1887F89829E6
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
0x251720B8C16FD688857B87B2C587CA9A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
0xF1E3FD10063D1B9ECD83C47E90DBBB19
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
0xA0F3225AD7EBF3D0C21C6088037D804D
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
0xCC2601CC18729AC636B1D8D597FD0B8E
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
0x091649A51BC466A37E82C1A52BA403F6
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
0x671772FA1205EA41BDD0C221327BEE38
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
0x60AAD4270D60A0D5FB7C67E3D7579F0E
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
0x722AE12D7CC94C0D92F9181005E79AF4
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
0x3845F0122C03B3599023DEB0E49A671A
echo toned every answer he gave me.
0x437B3E3762054A3591F652C90F2C4BCD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
0x60B25FA28E2C9FA7C98D787B4D99B8CC
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
0x1CEFE3A060D99388FFBA11F71C6DDB88
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
0x6B0B9D6469D5D9453964C0025CF3F9BB
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
0x1B0E67A175C3E9CE24ADB918D02ACC85
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
0xF5C8BEAFDCA5A336A3D77A4BF32E5918
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
0x5439772B27862CD1180F787C4B72B15F
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
0x2EE6AB48EE64470CB691920F472ABBFE
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
0x1A1070F29FAF048E27BC7AFA1F9442B1
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
0x8AAF81877500943B2A9B01BC4438F9B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
0xE89B7FC477CDF6C1192F1D433C294A07
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
0x66EB4587F846705460B54B44FD9E7D0A
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
0xDF8B4C96C192DB0C6587E687E29FB61A
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
0x246F990CF7A214FFE02ABB9160D5CF26
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
0x83CED4934C980B32A5E0965C2B541192
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
0x1835B5D6FB2C24B994D4EE406F85608A
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
0x4333E7729C324D6CA1E58CE8B0C68F18
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
0xBE55603ACBD8159DEFDEEB36A8F0E7E6
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
0x03647568975727C057C8395C86F5DC6B
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
0x1EFA2687D0C5B87803EDB6EFA80308C9
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
0xDAAF4F1C8934C72D0F046BFC756BB518
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
0x16A024E9D7F2EF979552C2A4663AF1D7
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
0x6A308238FF7188126177211B48519156
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
0x4F25A63EC431674E24FB938192FAE753
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
0x22354E62C72367C006914C9AE6E45D5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
0x5A326C6E11B6A5AD6EA03FF9C1CA50F2
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
0x4B11C3E713CE9BA5230FC3013EC4EB7F
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
0x74DAC507918121631411EC8E6F4987BB
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
0x09ED9D24B68867EFB2A04DF6C70D3D7F
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
0xB5A8589593C1799958CC1AB71542D698
spoke to the point at once.
0x8F8A108D023EB5FEF82EE46CC7FB7921

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
0x3EBCC5CFB36EF5A72D4C5C7ED3D92CFB
friends."
0xECEE2A77EA9C9DF1BB17BC96A502B53C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
0xAFCA4B1DDD87F8240D7A850D40165EF5
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
0x35066154E781DC932B00B822CA28DED8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
0xE0179FB284C399D362AD912F8EFDA80A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
0x9ACACFB564C7A98617F7DA4E340A64FB
good."
0xD77C3500D77C35007DCA2F664AA8EF07

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
0x4F5EC80DA89FE39EAB59A5C169FA42E8
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
0x1E9E5472E7344EC5C4F4B4FBC51D0F42
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
0xDADDE7E37568EAA01701F72A5B405F14
strangers."
0x446A71287364E38A5E3133FA108F85A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
0x431E87A4E3D3A6C83C28FA7655CD320E
regarding you as a stranger."
0xCC5B13BEE8F1BC11CBC89FEB9E8BDC25

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
0x08D01F18E97B53CE73A3B37F4AA27AC9
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
0x6E03C1266DB3AF8518419EF07F51872F
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
0x1813B2525AD47EFC9A8B1FA4D91B812A
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
0xC85D23F537E6AD5A1BAB9EE9BC161D1A
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
0x01955E9FED7EDA7C3DA87D368B289051
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
0x3EAA7A6582F4409C7FA2A75EE8606DEA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
0xA7F45313BD5545B6739B5ED371AF2A52
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
0xEF17FF1F9B8DD7C2D24401AC7F0EA6B4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
0x5404E8622CEA91263CE7D17F60BA77CA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
0x924D8686B22873A3AA47C79B1540A1E3
India?"
0x85CB3A8A85CB3A8A18D4CA4113424F0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You said I could not unless I married you."
0xEFB4CCD9957C611142265DFA124C3535

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
0x6732551D2EB102A2FC70CC822BE43C78

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
0x0565098A1A935CFD49B3BE19EC82DC77
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
0x3C72DD9F702B6A7068D4D146D7B349BB
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
0xCC3BB871F477E2C5D751ECA3856CDDC1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
0x250273987AFFDAE8805708E21AB66DEB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
0x832C9424E8A4EA6EF750DEF5B93321A2
crash down.
0x08E149662F2D020D6A7EF90C36C6C0AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
0x8EA976B5655E2EF86B0C73838349075C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
0x14C38C9373B5C5D1971814FF4C5E0E60
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
0xA0302A6569E94B2A45696B93337BE3D1
You are killing me now."
0x6617E52DE28C53DA646CA8088B2BCAC8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
0xE78613AD5D9374EFE34F68F83EBB051A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
0xA37351BCC13A97B12620F4DE69276365
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
0x562BA15DD62287B3B3FC58BFC4846712
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
0x5B71F32D51F108844F8DDB11599D5732
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
0x056360F5C9432104D503C5CB140E5DE5
until seventy-and-seven times."
0xED0FA9FD89C8921D62339B1AA82AF350

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
0xE81C6955C49578D30DC04C137D3D96FD
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
0xB7AB59B8E8079030E19574855A093493
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
0x3AF7E954EA2E8760F1BEF14FF4747521

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
0xDDDC323461BD75789B3B616B0F07F6C1
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
0xD75CC6C79B38B2690E77C9E8CE1E9D49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
0x7F5CAA424E3EE18B46485617969860EF
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
0x1594028E0B1E97DCABE3CBB2BEDFA314
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
0x801AB52111576BC348ECFFE6AA304E9C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
0xF7B543996E502CBB5AD6D075146D856F
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
0x0CF6358A2758C6BA4F98A2E580672A04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
0x5AF7780D555CA5960FE45AD69C63AF95
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
0x7D1DE10664F3E893850726EA4435E7C4
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
0x7CFAD94E456E0898DB15394B889CFCA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
0xB512B2480C9A34DAE2618DDEA0640175

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
0x6C1C0689ADF0526F3B5B00E3434B7AE5
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
0xB4DDA2B807A013B44ECCC74540B3D724
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
0xE524A2A24361F9DB8DA20ACA16C48E9C
spoke at last.
0x1FB5770001D8A271168417339799873F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
0xA3DACF4DD823FB736F599A4E08B80145
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
0xC162801CBF96B9C97A3D45ED144BCB0D
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
0xF0464047F9AB1BB3411AEA22232E4C95
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
0x340BDDEB23F1BDEE358208D919376D53
sake."
0xDDAA5DDADDAA5DDA540B81FF80F59B23

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
0x36709437EE6712572158B30D7844B89B
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
0x774EB159C70D944364EEBC3469670303
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
0x88ECE142008EB7B8AE9B0A783986DBEC
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
0xA98A9AD698B8A239ED46D6A09048A0BD
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
0x97FA7FBE7C1FAE74CDF58F6E19FF4892
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
0xA5A95A3B7D277E6FB9E634DADC938B4D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
0x26C36E75181E2C440F242762663324C3
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
0x1A3E7BAFA46CCE08E3FA3AD80B3CADBE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
0x5C5369A3DAF2290DE67BBBA027743570
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
0x7B2A4F8A78788AFD984552EFC8729855
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
0x6AED67471CAEE4195DD84D209AA0A490
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
0x219197825C9946B2C73FB344428CD590
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
0x07C1D46B63B838176969366D1547D9E4
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
0xF78C354309E14B13A7977FCC84DB84E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
0x01AD157BFCE1BE5EBF8BD980507F4FB2
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
0x5BAC8F93C1461B6BF56DBD09AECAFEB9
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
0xD38B195453B55348BB38BC234D56868F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
0x99DFB42D7D124FD0AD45AF53F24406CE
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
0xC881CC3AF50B76BB5C962266C4B41ADA
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
0x39F958EAD773A261C24352AAA1ED979C
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
0x14598C79A8286CF583407C00DDDA9070
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
0xD20DFC6914A1D797CBB401B058233B77

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
0x53B62954A62FAB0EA00DC02116DB6445

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
0xFBF0AFF78691511778A4B955585B7509
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
0x0A377E0D4E14E2B74BF69A47403FEF4A
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
0xD6D7607219F0A69158EB60D5B7F69DD4
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
0x14FF5C0CB23F55D1497D6D3E18F6C447
leaving it."
0xFB2368CF04715B8F62FC8C4A9AEEEB7D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What do you mean?"
0xD0ECBAF0C43CF305D22F4C93B379EF96

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
0x8A44473D12B37BF2BD05E1B8DA0407B1
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
0xF9A514EDE2E7EC27933165110833EBA0
some means that doubt is removed."
0x3B896BA979B91151EB62006AC3EC8045

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
0x5EC2F3F9B49F390AB27E51B38274A0BD
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
0x157FFC067BF2589A8C8FE2E6F174FD5A
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
0x1A8CB8D86474EC219FB2A8E12B492F35
Rochester?"
0x850B3B479610A8471A5CBCF1666CC12C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
0x1111102A2E7F8349BC7D2A8D850B41F3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
0x993C2D2585FF7FC8FE02CD1F0EEC04CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I must find out what is become of him."
0x377986AC0F685FBDB84CC848B7D63F65

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
0x5A0DBBD4D1F1A86935AB7C2D59E3076E
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
0x910AD0182CC4628D372F66CB27694175
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
0x571E23782F84DB4A3C74FB2550C1860F
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
0xA308B72F275D754BD82664FC5EE74428

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
0xC89D78AA76D94733065BBB45CA3C447D
was soon out of sight.
0x73A9F0D39D0FD951141A77524DCDCE3F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
0xD584D1B64677D429CD0B3E1B7BF8B319
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
0x9CCE0234407B06A8F44E8044363987D1
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
0x748CC1DC003B235AED2BD07DA0AD6539

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
0xB017CA3647923EB73189AE596B0FFCF2
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
0x106ABAA79948B9320B81A6F5C4E1578E
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
0x46A3CDBBCB70CF04FA8BE72754048DC0
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
0x0FF02DC5CAD157045B2960563DC989DC
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
0x48F44781056D5C36EFD6A8A660A1239D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
0xA66350EF8FE1FFB061CCE94C9DA5D4F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
0x140384A35BE75A56060DCF792447C962
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
0xB39E278D590ABE0B924A46D30A34141A
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
0x0A4C603C179A1A9C4B45B7E0B215F818
Jane?"
0x4F0A93C04F0A93C09CFFB8CED2453167

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
0x3B46B5154D4D89F46FC74FC00F25E7AE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
0x541E20D4D6884329C235425355386B4F
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
0xC7590A96BF9B43FF7746079D0CF1C80F
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
0x2C5FE94461A0A35DE2AF6F71DBE23245

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
0x169009F18E2FB3301B58C7808839E9D0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
0xD49EB581AF3B2685C8E355164942BD99
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
0xA6D0BA00225EAE976E789CF123A55C33

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
0x22A71566033A350EF7BE09E921DB3A92
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
0x2BFC6A1BACC4035A4B7027E33C2421BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
0x65A10D6B4051FDBB9168473872FE227C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
0xE00989BEAE4E7E7FE26D1F08300C19A6
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
0x417ABEF0DBB12F5844722161A41347F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have refused to marry him--"
0x71180F9BF77204A22C501EB3B4F4989B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
0x3CD60F752AB307EA74836DF8CD893161

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
0x4581B4F05E1EDB71F7AB771F85730826
as his sister."
0x29F5B690AFB809BA73C27D0B28DC6092

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
0x609EFBFEA6CA0213EA0B1D58055DC671
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
0xA7F3A87D2D4CFEE9CC44F1FCC100CCA3
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
0xDB166C374F92E536964DD0B3C43CBCFE
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
0xB46C1C1D84959B9EFF7B89D93F36FB13
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
0x789DDDDF0B7D9E530259344C39BE3FB2
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
0x4D40AE39C62CF3C8344740B9BF573B03
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
0xD2AFD767E37E050A32243AD62004FA42

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Not as a husband."
0xB0B1681996157FAFC353F5AFABB647C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
0x68683B2957D68AB4FCA03E6EBECAD730
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
0xEE69B702882076CAEDF326080A574074
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
0xF6B669B66CE8548F9789D49187FA0CDB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
0xAA8DE125C94A465B64FFEC63D772371C
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
0xBE345098AB28C5CBB665853A2E20DCAE
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
0x91268CD3E7F99A1E91598FEF2347C6B6
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
0xCEB22D16643C113CB6F731219D75FB57
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."

"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again

0xBA8EA18091EB8F91A8D4CD73548A0FDD
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
0x968BE68ADCD3BE44EFA6EFC5AB5B563B
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
0x768F3989CCD06E787FF0D1BE148DAB0D
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
0x2632582FECB62235BDD3D4960E4CF3DC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
0xAD7D87C28E898CCC02AF3ADFD4CC4E84

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
0x1302E0EC5377259EB7352BEC0688AD52
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
0x9750DDCEB8B505AAED77C5A2DE8773B3
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
0xFCE94097682BF052075BC6C7B2C7A8EC
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
0x453766CCD2C940B42794CDA6025456F0
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
0x30716A298BD911DB1C35B10E2BD377EE
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
0xE5F538531B4BDEAE2C31EC4EA208E65E
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
0xB5BE3CA3222130269E26DCB79DCAE74E
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
0x64508D270077A90BC3026EE70FCFA1BB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
0x9836224F8AEA3026C505DFF02D06B911

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
0x54627BD6F08A7501B82EAAD7B44E86C0
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
0x236DD20292B04443DFF1C26227575958
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
0xB3DC956E387DE71EA0ED86AD4D2A6D28
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
0x7F28E585293CB39CA5EFFC0631118DCC
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
0xC49A3F6986240A6A052DE5CF05BAF6C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
0x55D9ED13BCF853E760C75C98BC7201D9
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
0x4D824CB9ACEF62795E03F4A3F1352A17
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
0x0AA8784789599321714080A0E40CA7C1
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
0x08FE6697EF3A2F3643E420A2514490BC
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
0x108A58252A57AD0EF3B157CD30132986
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
0xC1E5149177FD9B7CA6AE0DC408928B5A
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
0x034FE0C6639DF2B76248B96378CEE137
had forgiven me once more.
0xDA22A5206D2A36D3593CC053B8253C5D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
0xA44904A109AF3E368EDF8A4142F825E9
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
0x215EFA881911096005046CF377D962EB
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
0xFB9A58B962EA5970B3E90D6F67DDFE45
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
0x60C59FAB59816B653D336B61B450D3B8
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
0x277DFD70238E7A16E476E1409EC32BDA
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
0x7D162F9FB958A8260CD4EF15A5456642
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
0x89BB1ABBAEB3B3735164F25919369B52
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
0xC3CB411ED66EE4393F07D4E76FB7ABFD
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
0x90022BA36668FECC2F24F983CE198A4F
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
0x86906DCE8CC1B64D1251DA54EB8D6E3D
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
0x580A971E16D72F4FC758E2BF154CCAB6
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
0x49B10E18BBD35CCC5C73FFFC17756224
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
0xDB0037F5A701AC1723E78442C0A31A54
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
0x191E095C1D7BBDB9E3825AA60452EDFC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
0x09CA6DF5275FE863976433A9F50EDC97
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
0x67447CCEB923B71765722265BC5C1EC1
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
0x16E40D8EFA99BEDF8A8EC5BCE29C3E09

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
0xCC23AD76C6342F235398D9BFC17543B1
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
0xED5D89432C6F3324B9CA302379FCE5A2
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
0xC12D1C17B544075225D07692EB4E57E3
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
0x415F4940ED121198982B2355BA3C07CF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
0xC708F115356A707368D2C80CF6D9EDB4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
0xABE6EC882866CEF73B4380A2909CB4BE
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
0xA6DB9F4194AF899F5803B3E89BE7EF9B
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
0x1D6412F58832992C6C1FE5EE0E34B2AD
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
0xC2EA5F7FF98440394F5A007FB454AA41
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
0x741812132A145DBD4BE6F3FD5ED50159
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
0x39706EAE526A4757D1D1C754C9A4DF5B
Lamb is the light thereof.
0xA097F716CB6E4B656355719DC47A0ED8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
0x1478CD5913623AE1158EFD77BBA5DEF5
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
0x76A6D09D70B06C00896998C7DD653639
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
0xC9A481C63CF0E7CEDFC4A7E342FD48F2
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
0x879773462A773F192C5F7087141B3B43
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
0x3368093B9EB97A582C94B3D8E940A435
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
0x6925B07099FFB057B7B288BC4062F7B4
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
0x7B027941DECBD6CC7CEF79359DF478C4
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
0x8569848A3BF69D56CE73C6509B9E95B8
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
0x2B4BFD56E427AD6EE3280BFD05569254
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
0x1C0B02B2687BF0F7E981CD4BE6213428
could not but feel it too.
0x9577908FE6BDEE5B39C7B4255FC21D6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
0x7A66C61002BA7E5E3E8D0E0A00F41F67
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
0x80A20C9F190165EBE574B5F4F803AFEB
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
0xEA1EEFE9578675FB7B10993345C35353
and wished him a pleasant journey.
0x11D1412C93406CCE0ADDCB0FBFC0C575

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
0x22BDBC185669C885C626898A7F10CD66
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
0x5597CA1E03E375391CB73C469EC0CF6B
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
0x3AAD28EE6BC7D80A8C0EA79AC31B18DF
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
0x8C2B01DEFF154B34CC3B1C9178711870
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
0x20A197F900A60CB734BCA52B9EDEE41B
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
0x90B395E6BAB18E43850ED9709FF3B569
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
0x3A5E99154D9F07917FB05295E78D45F2
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
0x1567A73BC568477707C77E94E5002811
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
0x1D4E8D1F2CB249F653AF78C964E89DFD
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
0xC717C119A54E6C93E9D564F4A2DD0BE6
from you!"
0x2BB12A99BA8EB50F731E8BFAC8ABD33D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
0x06F457836E725AA7E24BA2DBBE37B8A2
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
0x82D586A40CFDD3D7F34A13ECA1FB658C
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
0x00E2BFF5A572D39490AD98487ADBFCA1
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
0x056617FC87304006ADBC6AF3D649DB47
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
0x2B121FEB21290F30A718A7709C7C97EE
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
0x1668D4660BB1F120E6FFA105EE83B289
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
0xBCE51D227817FFD4C80F7A5CB571F6F0
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
0x8DFCFC604924B8344521EECDB180AD2C
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
0x9CE3C3C6A0ECC2A1C60E32D946FFD1F4
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
0x46D4F3137C9E03E5EBDF5000EBD66F99
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
0xDA07A4DB38F5B4121B5865BFF9935C35
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
0x970799BB088E23ACCA0B70D3FE316652
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
0xA90921C12813D825F3130EFE7689762C
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
0xAD3F654BC0B3F130DC2A5E9773684B2C
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
0xF91E34928F47AD0A94933E1EDDAD1943
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
0x6CEC6A1C4360FEAFB8C0CAD8E9B58E68

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
0x9981A3A2DBF4E95D8FA96317CBBD54B0
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
0x4A968830CC2CC36211B368966E43B2CE
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
0x759851C6878208EFEA8381E6C0EF6356
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
0x0202D427B39F5F1C24D71D3F40243945
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
0x1934E6DBA48EA5097B9A33C710BC795B
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
0xB024CBCE988A0781D527B3CE5C035950
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
0x87AD39589A6AE51CB391AA692EAA8FD6
dim room was full of visions.
0x8E2F27F25CEEF22D7D8A6BB38582100A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
0x92F97F79B473F7257C511BB6106CC116
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
0x9AF417DBC4CBB5E2717DC03CDF40A633
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
0x7D485DE36C35DFDD03176BCF31333641
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
0xFAAF41834B1749B807143165EFD15D20
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
0x9009DE4B97C1DF0E18F3B580CD04CC58
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
0xCBBC0D55826E431B65FCCF2C5DD61E91
prayer: it was only elevated.
0x0BC01EA00C43254333352876CB71EE7A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
0xA74170144A931E4CCF16AA0E2D9A1D58
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
0x0A0B89F111454DB1292CAB9EA911984F
and now--come afterwards what would!"
0xC85800ED3805D94F4AFF54E3EDEFE4E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
0x49595861F70D24B0F05D52F8FD9FC011
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
0x21F16E957F3968DDD8F9ADA128100BE6
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
0x8BB3E3057AF425E5C97C659066566656
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
0x16D717CFF83558806F04C9612CB5DE34
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
0x0ABF7427745FA90E6BC4E29B0688E20B
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
0x5A2FA8111BC7C71A634F50E2D878C4FF
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
0x4C65FC5FCC84EE3B0741ECB7BBD29491
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
0x5125120B49367095902E02BB90730D9E
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
0x343478BD8C1371B82E09E0A0027B1E6F
shall judge.
0x7A54504C3ED8E66C535109E1C260CBE9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
0x0B7F779D455C1ACB5E25508293DD0B72
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
0xA4DF7C30B41B9EEDE852AF6B4FCBB86C
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
0xC96461F53BE654F1AFA4FA3CE3DCC2A6
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
0x7A986E285D7C48D7AEAA02D258BF1BBD
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
0x1D63DEC0AE3087CB6EBA44B3E5A240DE
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
0x0EDBF705F538F47C4AEE6652516DE958
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
0x33F97B16A71622BFB90F64F66EADBE79
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
0x87466CE1DE04FF8953E09919157D20D4
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
0x86BCA5229E2D5F0F88892A88D80DEC21
bones.
0x918F6C68918F6C68310D0F62D75061D2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
0x3F09AC17A99D2AB46644E85A0CB0F793
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
0x927AB5E603745E14F813247FDB0E92FF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
0x80558FA569ACAABA1A3C22DC1A87DED4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
0xD3FE0DB7378E7BD2181B6BF9E039A478

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
0x8F5DA920FD0D3420A984048DB9C111B2
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
0xB1905192A2E5AD7752118CC939E888B2
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
0x5597286CE0664EF7ADAAAEF5B571A222
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
0x3FD5987BE21368C4A9EE761695876031
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
0x8624847AE55DD5FE7978A57CCE44FD54
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
0xA581B8013B207EDE5CF4018540F22A95

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
0x81173E6B56B549C025176936281C6047
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
0xDF110CB6E64C9E4D58C3D9D134A47EB6
garden: it was void.
0x2CF7CE5893D9C735F250FD2313F3B50B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
0x8524045256092EFD27B4EA97A296CED0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
0x72C5D1F42F3A82CA749709AC61156CFF
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
0x2164F3E84DE029088C263BABF879B430
loneliness and midnight hush.
0xFA2AAE52D7299A408257057D6A09CBF3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
0xA778A2916A55483AE96B7967503C73FA
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
0xE4CC3AE4C35B8D75DC9D7C1D006C1E77
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
0x14FF7626E057EC5257EEEC57FB43729E
best."
0x136B8A48136B8A48D5465B2CD7300B5A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
0x2DB183AFB6E6F869945EBEBF168E8874
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
0xA56C3362FE1F9321D0665285A513A895
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
0x73BC595712268F2D7CE93F3CA61E9C7B
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
0xC5FBFEE68404DA147E23CFC5CF2B57CF
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
0x168C32EAE36070B8250DE9254AF289E9
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
0xD19E9996F1388BE5ECA690E8DE9C6928
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
0x5137A94A3ED691C3FC71355B734984B8
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
0x347978C31C06CCF7C61E548E2C68EF8E
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
0x630EB6C45BE4AD764728BD6723B8453A
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.

CHAPTER XXXVI
0xD505749F830E327692CE43BE2DAD9DDA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
0xA41B0657AD2B7358472E16FC138B3994
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
0x4A09D70C3DD9EEC285EB811D9AFE3E18
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
0x48755FCDE02B1D4101E5EE3AC9767C9B
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
0x97A74C321842CBD147BFCB4B73A7270D
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
0xCEF80F2C03B4E15068E65AFD30F33FFD
I took it up.  It bore these words--
0xDDCBE77CB5BF57ED0BBECB3FBD596262

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
0x2F9A9C845A899495FC750025B81FCC2B
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
0x80A5945CACE4C73318E48B34DF50D0DF
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
0x73752FDDF7CB2FA1F33766EA840B7124
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
0x7097A6BF9545CA569C7A7D7772B21FA1
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
0x4002666F817635FA06FA587BBF8B4FE5
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
0x4EC5A6BF69E9D2124F01D74B3AFFAB66

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
0x46207955A99576B2A195795BB9D0DD44
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
0xDE5B548217C4B1112EE8CB532C2A4805
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
0xD43743FBE99A2472B3CE05FE9F37671D
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
0x095E70443FDD84D586FA658585379014
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
0xFC2DBC5E540E106AB49E83AAAA48F525

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
0xD6C9B6A9EC71384EDE7C76BAC413826F
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
0x9E3E476FED4F7D65087D0BA1A3B1335B
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
0x9889930F0A57B4231C399446D8C03EBE
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
0xA548297191879B7B353AD91AA4D630DE
would meet the coach.
0x3CA4B11BA460C4D8D10405DCA9C669A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
0x3E3D0D32AD3A5796E37745F4B4C24F4F
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
0x79B29965039029C9B2EBCA3E54B762F6
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
0xE185108CA388DA29C431C404BEBDBE20

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
0x3AC5E2B0320E0095CEA1A0C552573EB6
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
0x6C403A70D980FCBE4BDBD3AA1259AF88
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
0x19CA0BD6BD4FD565848A45A3DD21C027
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
0xD2DCD46C9C47C8B0645D42C84907ADB1
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
0xB7C44FABCA43385E89C00D3D61FC99D8
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
0x0FB037BE85E8E05B81C05D89E4C8302B
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
0x650C4A85E72EBC3D2B1192F0862E4072
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
0x06AB0A83913149BB6C0A12740DE591A7
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
0xAA54085A5692B7DF845E2D96E9E0E9F7
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
0xB49FBA572AEA472B6E2E9D2BB90023E4
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
0xF251204077C327D8C6260287DEC86D02
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
0x40982B25E0F22A79CF0E1EB900E4CDBF
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
0xAEB5B5465B1DEAD7DEC8595FFC5C7E29
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
0x97FB505B43BD7E7806F2949FA9C00698
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
0x1CB38BB4D09B8DD58BCA2C12B666404A
body.
0x9D6567469D656746C3B4DB343FD9A88B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
0x3FF8BE51FC30CDF542E6FF6976FF7DAF
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
0x3FD6E1DE4579E672E9F3E4D60019A5A0
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
0x8570E3BB904E9BE64E90F12D30D028AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
0x2421C98F9DBE01CB8A0981B18E64C520
and should be absent at least four days.
0x8DD78E0857E5BC5BFBBBE6C849B6CA93

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
0x4874FFB5251F1C45D2178559739E4760

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
0x60389DD1C6499D0CE76D8816CE87C73A
time been uneasy."
0x2FE45D07E7D15716C8A5051AEB926014

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
0xC3AFAB90F269F319CB0896CEC6C74434
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
0x93E44C26768DE80582CFFA665308FE78
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
0x53245C75C074883C0A85F09057B80D97
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
0x1E1CAB285644DBA1737DB4ED1C7015B3
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
0x42B72A0017706633A5E63B4B35341E07
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
0xB8682D6557415C3A4A0F0D29C3A99876

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
0xE47801735FAB123BB8DDDF9F00916003
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
0x90CBF9A3DC935FD44B3E88E85192AAF8
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
0x4571A88A22990C477ECD83BEBCEAD88B
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
0x47BC221CB0DDB1EDF34D8A2876F46E5A
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
0x2440E676333B726B53524B19557E3012

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
0x45C887C9123DF8B769E717D495570D94
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
0x2C511B33619A5F8F1A0F9237DEED0FAB
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
0x2C442DB46128A3CB77EC6FD00EB1B24A
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
0x7EFDD4B662AF54DEE80DE8E13BDDEB41
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
0xDA4CF521C4C80BBDB34B3F25D4AB643B
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
0x60F39991D1CC21D30805423834A10CEC
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
0x4A3F4234BCFD3ABA351038A29A6A11FD
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
0xE73C6A738AEFEE4CE1CC0D887FE3E534
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
0xF561594CC1F174C1A145EBD2F20D2610

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
0xD8EECEDB611F95F32D8ECB0F7A14ED2E
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
0x852EA50427C6B6405C4CB4677B977635
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
0x45A804BFF1B4ACE6CDB95B949A4A30D8
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
0x4F04AEFD095D5DB3388A9D1C1BE20BDC
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
0xF5F9C87BB3FAECBAD3A9967755B1D0AF
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
0x7788CE558C595043F06A8D3FF752EE7E
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
0xB4BFA2C272F187C32F6E78CC74F38EA5
we were near my bourne.
0x2A94B6F542974E39080AE4F0659DD12A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
0xFD3C5F2D298DABEBA182B81DA7E9C497

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
0x648C6FD7FB0A2A49792B703E821FDDD2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
0xF331F1F289BCC7E5B591C97713E4DBFE
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
0x29830ADF9F0A41ECE8D0EC716268909E
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
0xCAAE41700DAEF43506B1431D69337BAE
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
0x55FE7D668EFC68ECA6239E425E128ABD
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
0x861255D6FDA9AC545441BB5F4CD9CE2C
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
0xF21C17DB591E6520B28B4296EB62ED04

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
0x87F4BCC7B5E9E6F5E742BB1D18B7F270
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
0x10427473AEDCE1095ED36C04058DDBA1
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
0xBD23085DBF46F0A2A264D0F4ACEF573C
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
0xAFEAFFF12FC5C0AB54D78ED6C8F6C5B3
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
0x9F85A4EA48522D4CF7AE8D3B5E82C91B
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
0x6AC67191E6F17A806223046D04B149D7
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
0x737E87B99C160B8C61742841249E1B97
Mr. Rochester be at home."
0x08747985A24AAF958E9AD735EF815225

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
0x60578AB59D9F0DCC7C051DA3D32CCC04
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
0xC5220591FF1C3D5B60CB7229EB900E0B
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
0x986D52D85A915D0D0826EEF768DCEACA
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
0xC23C916425CF0AB72C749DCB64603B5F
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
0x506291C9F1BF55A0CDDCB11E610EDEF5
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
0x5AD1930E43C24F27CE73471490EB50BB
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
0x44D4D9564C7FEA86F36020133A98005D
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
0x05D150AFD327DCB7B771A7302363A184
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
0x6FD9504D5A38BFA466FF92FE07EF187E
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
0x2289E0B3F4F15BB0652EFDFDC23CE36A
them!
0x6237C3886237C388347DC44BB85E4E49

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
0xAF1862718C1B83CD10D80D4C2ABC2C07
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
0xC5F6D8766500884BA3718C271CD34501
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
0x284773ADB3AE28D8479253BC9607FB83
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
0x1AC038F36107BAB4DCEC4965A3A3D995
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
0x5287C0FAFA8B646C2DF615CB06B3E5C1
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
0x04C61A3C857D45031BD0C74C1245CE52
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
0x7312CBC31039EB1432CEE51B25647094
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
0xB152EFDF41814A31BB59E1C423529896
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
0x3BE5A1F54A3F564AE5F3104976A6170D
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
0x4B062E7DFA9A893168BB0BB1172E4DDC
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
0x008E12E2B254FDBF147539C9B4908798
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
0xAF1615E701BD0C666FC1217E1373CA6B
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
0x613A5C17ED7C62FD2EC0C829072373FA
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
0x501E40289DD88FD8F6A2CC15E0045CA6
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
0xA454A57858FC1946C3AE2189D1B0EBD8
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
0xE96F316F62F5390841B493E8338CEF88
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
0xF152CBBB67F5184EDE40B698FEF1524A
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
0x08FD10A408E7210A119954E08860F9DD
station were at my command.
0x8FD79B478429B9E359F4DCA2CD84D37B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
0xA18F52656DD08B5BF2FA24C7F5F4AF81
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
0x7742F3BA2BB2FB684B66FADD50C0AF64
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
0x03464E27C7ACEC8398A5AD76BEF4F1EB
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
0x328B160E61B3FF9205D90415D81BD9D5
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
0x9865D285DA3BFBDA1C56B55F97680DC6
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
0x47037475C1D7DFCFB82757628B07EB11
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
0x8497B232C2E2BBA8B99011B08575F72B
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
0x317BE457D2A7AFFA47237F995F228FA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
0x085AC31A772AD310E642A2314C4443A6
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
0xB4E9415F649AE2CA3901727F8F49692D
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
0x3C76E0FD2E7012E0BF5CF6774C8CE2D1
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
0xEE10EC87D3FFB7A9BD3322CCCADB99CD
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
0xC261C3451D70D0A36EB2CBF1FB16CD38
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
0x1FA7B1A9658554ACFF2609F09F301740
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
0xD588EDC0B1160A2ED80566BC189124E0
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
0x2A70A45200A02FCE90062561CEE0DBF0
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
0x339C43E86C3984A6928BABDF349B527D
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
0x8479A9F8554A3E9FBE7A68589B59B899
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
0x94E1F42E870C65A58586E407E847510D
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
0xF153A5B80F933E9A9BF655DB9547C5CC
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
0x359DA6AD1742390D5BF038435489CF6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
0xD7F26645126B717C29429BDB344B8015
ruin.
0xC5408D24C5408D24B6B88C8E7CE10229

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
0xEF00A896E4D571F6633FBD1C4EA9EACB
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
0x521B959D04DB9612AA8E4C1FEE0EEE06
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
0x8B4F5AF1C709A548D905E0D6DB267CD6
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
0x086A858868AA48D32B6975E410E7A648
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
0x8AA79BB3163CB162C7D608048B7475B6
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
0xA3488E696DC73440E28A2DFB0B4F4F03
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
0x02E422E7C2D2302B2F62325B0AAAD546

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
0x46D25253A191E32036BEC68CE3C76A55
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
0xB8EDCE8F02B6A0FC4F685F7EF2A2E919
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
0xF401A1A9703486C8F97EB3FEB61F687D
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
0x9B8D2985AC0479120ADAB5A5A1599C37
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
0xAA77DFF585EB8244757B600B5B0F6CA5
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
0xDB45B69438D6172E3A77205B5ADAA4AA
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
0x7A1E592DCC2FAA729C3DCBFDEFBC9ABC
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
0x2EC854CB143649ED134BEEDEBEF6594F
token.
0x5627F9525627F952ADEFCDF5152455BF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
0x05DFCE44DA2AA44576931B4A7DB62E1A
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
0x8129592DE3B1EA9B32BF1B9FC2831116
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
0x20B2CD0F5F623E288407B22AC12CE7A2
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
0xAAFEEFDFFA26727C181B4B9BE702E6EE
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
0x41FB288F52931BF8CF0FA2E66BC37DBE
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
0xAB0F2A0B48E2A0EDDDC72734092BBE0A
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
0x8527AC67C49EC696B0A3548B14C68181
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
0xE1FADE08BC8D63E08DB07424BDC96DF4
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
0x98ED3499C6AC2B263CEC9ACD6A08E408
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
0x7CB1CDF82F1333B858ED3D2A8661B9A4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
0xBEAA2E042BC19DFB38A942D280E3F7AF
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
0x5545BAA057259BA803163F0852049FA5
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
0x58FB3A54905C3E3FEC8535B2979E0624
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
0x01F08E7F24B5CC09639872A10D406BC1
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
0xDDB1E5700FFC0712B98E7567CD1474B2
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
0x62C2AF223023236B719AF37E9B643613
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
0x487DF5DFAFA03C038344641026F26B14

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
0x051C3C7D8EBB2151CE756CF43A2A3D6E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
0x326D9C7B7D8EB233B687F72691FEAAE0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
0x5E02CA06F6A639CC09F1919465791CDB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
0xF2F12F85786D8A6DF00A9014767A455A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
0x30056E560490D390F23DB739532BF54A
trying to evade.
0x06BF4A2FF76AC186CF1BF52C05EAC4E6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
0x9291BF08E7547C15F5096DF2271153A5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
0xA87113F30CBF72E6AC223016A208C007
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
0x6D0D6D131D48847C96256F26ECCCD1B2
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
0xA74DA96AC57FD36B38EE9BCD0BEE1C39
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
0xF78D78A6E9F2630CFCB10BA0AF3140AB
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
0x888C46B1EB9DCA9C8017B40214916E59
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
0x5231F110C5C6E02CC12A8F519A9D8910
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
0x2AA2A5F7C2067E065CB822DFD599CEBC
Antipodes.
0x39AE57EC415AB06C19D38EAE5AE7D2E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
0x3489B28EC7E6FD321A2C44B206BC4B59
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
0x1AE39A28B314931D482956E70B17346B
direct question as to where he really was.
0x27509D853D56F4C3D0964781BF348AA6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
0x51113E3621B33FF38E13A9317B43E518
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
0xD2E1E3F0F3A0D9754F965C4F360A9E3A
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
0xCBAFB653DCA044BD4B0166CFF80E7F93
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
0xACD12E864FE9690FCB60713A4154EDB7
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
0xCFDC60F3AEDE670A7FC9255D68F14870
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
0x04E16EE745628ABFC5F134B8D0CC357A
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
0xECDD70AD23A1FA822E91CE5402572893
witnessed it myself."
0x473C5ABC7D5D78C8B466A3710FB9ADCA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
0xB5B74E417B6DC1EBA492C0125F8133E0
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
0x00108AA60687D356B640598D9C494C88

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
0x330CC3CF7290E0B26083805F7AB3204A
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
0xD4B29C4A81C3FAD957633F9D42317701
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
0x243DB1901F85E8DF0639EE7E34B712E0
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
0x39B7A523F31E9C0F704F8C397D17D9A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I have heard something of it."
0xC253CB82C3D9EEF0AC67BBDD886F058E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
0xADBC6CA48514C544F8E17140B8608894
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
0xB31AE139CE94242340E6258EE128A521
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
0x4FB96D06BEBB948C127C3D5895270908
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
0x9AC3564C1EE08DAED2212B85F5BFA40E
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
0x53EEADCA0208E2DADC22F506CA6F2460
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
0xC03951BA18655144FA1E817BB91E0746

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
0x834553F3A3C39BCEFEE672F0DD8BB101
main fact.
0xE125A2F98AD108E5F67895C3520CDFEE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And this lady?"
0xC58BBA1D240EDCB792634F7B64A57332

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
0xF1D2481F0E969E129EF584D10F389DB2
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
0xEF9F5BDF6BDC9FDB94175F019131BCD0
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
0xDDD0C20B631AC3BE7ED23D65F78BF8B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But the fire," I suggested.
0x4256505FFA7B96A987EEEDC9281AFAAF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
0x6A8CDADD419B7262403FADF8F5FA84E1
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
0xA7177A98483FF57419D52218B69B3BF3
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
0xBC9F04561D064AE4396EA0F5B1A7A64E
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
0x1C577162780E8D5AFFA85568D7C00C39
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
0x7F1FDE4E584FE84AFE7B11D318299B53
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
0xBE667A1E5F59D8AD8510F3B62E2CC7C5
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
0x5AA7494C30D7C378BD89408AE345DBFE
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
0x4A44E62AC42FC6177A972205E8EB4FEA
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
0xD419E0F03262B1AC14CA1A2E8994C4F2
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
0xB663684D939745FD2E52479EDAC336D9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
0xB5F7614A92535B7A53079F7F179C0D76
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
0xFC903D6C236887AC499497558D482A83
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
0xF03AE05D1F6FFF1043AA862E57839527

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
0x08340A2A719EFD2E01E1BB6ABD98BC68
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
0x6F5A76D0171D7CF657F911C857CBE0B3
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
0xA7455C6F16E6C846F7B6B7B889FEA1B7
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
0x1927234F4ED0C1CED3B21917A7068922
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
0xB2A9E2A5A7F958AB4DD64F7184D899CF
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
0x904F3FDA6FD5C0CC1139BA9E41A784AD
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
0x59D692C5280C57DDB66F9FFD9495AE45
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
0x545F4B6470C8AA9B2912897C65630C79
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
0x1A6EDA549CD7963D69CFAB1945646F2D
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
0xCC555BE0D83CC3AD30521E58380D8873
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
0xA285446337F2BC5831663636F4208B19
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
0xB9E8E885B31329DF61A21B9492F4DBDC
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
0xE6A34F30EDF8C752C52A918D96C138F8
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
0xA70996A4D73ABC717057F303554D7EB8
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
0x140C484FD4FDF0301E421D6069194B3C
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
0xFF917148864F61A849E19B726EC6E38D
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
0x2AB880D8B82E69E2D9279019E95D7F02
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
0x492E4660FD5CBD1C13D2B0AF6E981B31
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
0x79D5ACD86EBBE918F1E279A25DFD4759
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
0x5DD90DE20A29AF10B604FE2970C98908
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
0xBF084324DCAB7427E12DDDF2823137DA
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
0x5D805683F933EAE040258370FA2DF974
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
0x1DA54F53DAF98F390670343038B74784
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
0x38F6592089004AE84447A8E51B33C69E
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
0xBB5E86BB7F5DE1544C8DDA56908A6AEF
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
0xCCCABACBEE225EE8CD528A92E777F2BA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
0xBAECEB4A2A61CE67E0F1F98C6BBB9410
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
0xCF49C6E019B341A627A58BA741649139
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
0xC782D6C02E098ED427652A20CB12F587
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
0x9C0004AB4C8CAD1731E1DDB2BC271EF9
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
0x92594ED0C3FE0C12DE6FFFBDB29767FB
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
0x87F7EB5634CF4342C690BF8FA65D9E59
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
0x48412383F5F5E2642A0BC0344A03724F
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
0xAEBD8EBC50043CBF62B9C2C0521C9655
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
0xD09230DBB49873525A9367EAB5174BDE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
0xA09588C52516F25BD67624F52459A76F
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
0xB2E308FFE665114D158C097C1AC17BFA
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
0x704349A32FDE94402CEA8B9F58EEEF6B
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
0x9328657FF2E7CE631DDE7DC254D2173C
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
0x42602C7E97CCCD131C6FA8883916ACD1
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
0x8BEC82E38F71B729D4DF42C3FE66BCA5
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
0x1DD513561C23FBCD356FC55547E536FF
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
0x3AEE69F36F7CA4ED7BB537901C630250
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
0xE48DA7B1D20A3B4B511081B2D0472F2F
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
0xB8FF75D5AB2266F4768DA2C112A12CBA
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
0x9E1BB14EF043902E270555A91100FEC2
ask what had caused this calamity.
0x17DACEE5E58888B68FCCC395E1206D1A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
0x87A42259E084673886BF31C680E24764
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
0x96CBAB12CEF5DB2315B7F16623249593
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
0x41E6C2F663716AA1A299475B1F142A64
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
0xD0B49553B30AF5FE2E0291D3A7E0A9CE
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
0x737659666E975E943C16FD92083E5AB1
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
0x83570335DBF9B5AE1C9C88CBA51205EC
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
0x92E722E7968366BCCFFB23770F08999F
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that

CHAPTER XXXVII
0xB5F90D371A8B31E5921D0A6223025EAA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
0x6E804207443A2FF726291228B1C985F2
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
0x71E8C73EA2FF29AD6486D4615D4F8399
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
0x0B355C6C9753929151A1999F8E36D1A7
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
0x34D2CC36ABC2D3D2DA6A1A60E8671669
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
0x537C277B7D66BA01018D3902C20C0AC1
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
0xB350B9040665A59E06C52EEF6B106405
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
0x512815245F8DF8BD8F8B7A6C42798EBE
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
0xCEE06F71E362CC4F464F60768449EC60
there in the season to shoot.
0x269C1A8415C2ACA399E7DF765EE234E4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
0x2F64A2C40B956B508BBC266319606308
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
0xA56D60CC4A869EF05786F0ADBD34154E
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
0xE94BADD09D50B874F4CD3A3F166EC4F4
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
0x1E856F00DF435B242AD29A36CFD76161
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
0x87BAD057AC6D3DAB6CD2C8262FC1C2D3
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
0x6945C0DD0BB21365ED313375145CE90A
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
0xB4E3B3F9988EAC5657EFA8F2A1BCEB1B
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
0xA5B588243F5CFB5B9CDDDBA00A0327E8
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
0x10E4A6748C7725B4C54787CFB99C7021
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
0x7785152EC5FC35B90E46DA36646D807F
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
0xFB15DC43FC4E3E773BBA6FE24C8C5881
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
0xE2C198FDB8FDE5A6037B91ECAF76568F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
0x48BC3DA1E0DCA3D87FA30326153876DF
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
0x2FF051860F5D589127DD0FB66CFE2A11
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
0xA0E2D9E78FF2FDCEA08FB1F152B02060
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
0x630D1F518719941F264D07CB2B0CFAC7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
0x9BF9442C9C5D89562FFF625BDB017BFB
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
0x8DA0BB020FC5E7C50BC85677D6679101
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
0x8E69922031CF9A6C14C1E871F12E247F
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
0x472469F8B983F4F99FA42FE116B17CA3
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
0x0B63E27F7D66C96BA45BF8596A3E8C0C
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
0xA87E0816704E0BF66538DF9D965C4F58
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
0xA81C8F93DCC495D16772414A2BE3F81A
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
0x190B6A3F82C58414A31F8199B9E9D412
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
0x07A200206DF76CD0359F85B0E3A4537D
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
0x89B8A4CAD8880D53D00B33EB7D31BB4A
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
0xF7B624CFD3209AA0192CBA6D3947A39B
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
0x5E0E8DB3BE84260885D87115F276C84D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
0xEC8951339394201E02DC49D9D3A1F806

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
0x0F0BC121C9E42FE54B6D164266BD3823
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
0xD3BC594DC13C6D2977D1110AA4873648
grange.
0xDA43B9F2DA43B9F2D7AECAA33D087E22

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
0xCD3BEF6975808A1D76144295B2E1C7B1
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
0xF134BE936186780A00B32CE7FEDBFD2E
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
0x511AD2AD6ED09586E85E82B032D257E8
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
0x092A8E6379F8500B5C7717674F98D7A6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
0x876E3745AA48B21538838C54841909EF
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
0x6A650FC5363067CFD6CB7EDB7FDCCF8C
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
0xFA86201C7B9592CD090AE5E9C509FF67
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
0xEF4C00B28CF0B0AC7DCECCB902E9F86C
advance.
0x1D57A3F3020737712B328CFA3D4C29A3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
0xD047517A69886404911F54A861345E17
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
0xF472E919A83AEBB0CE33E99CE026595B
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
0x15A0BB13948A13272E471A4C65BAB474
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
0x7343588EEC816F5E9FAA13EC5CBA7D4E
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
0x388817BC4F84122A248E375FBE250E69
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
0x25EF107412D24803EF5AE6D4975136B3
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
0x00BF8B5BD3FBC0BE1C2403019B76B0DA
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
0x0EEF38700ED30A0860FC5FA3E9AE7D32

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
0x51AFDD3C44D1A6BF3B7001A58C28B41E
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
0x7A9CA5FF10B82201BFDDEB4B50054228
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
0x6B6F3F2E3F83ED9714E1184FC2CA3FFD
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
0x0CC0D6B95289424DB9DF727874EB8717

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
0xB1BC2490F842AFF20CBEC8DD0CD19482
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
0x589599CFA25C40B9191A7C60A6693E92
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
0x68DAD409F5E2841C5DEA9B67300C6478
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
0xD8F7418D1C6AC0A46A62861EFBC625DE
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
0x39A6937ED23490C68126E605391E22F3
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
0x6DAFE628983DC8270F858E3ECCC49AA5
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
0x2B0F793334FC08B96C03E6637CB368C5
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
0x3D967DD9BCA93A197F596051F6230090
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
0x669FB93C1458499C02E279193DBCF1BE
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
0x7EE30C1648A7D5900E76CA892ED3DF5E
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
0x5A5CBFA19F4EF0BACDCB98054B11CE73

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
0x61BE66D292969F182B963DA00B5E5D05
had you not better go in?"
0x08D11A6E25BEA73DE233EA4701677B23

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Let me alone," was the answer.
0x706BE203E0BC78A525CBFECB614F0351

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
0xA3440F3DD05B995703B47230739EC1F8
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
0xA641DBEA8FC720C07C6EC243D6049A29
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
0xA7E5C906CF8C88FD1ABF7BCEF57495AD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
0x705BEAAB7D753A7FFB3E7E1BFC3DF854
"how are you?"
0x8A2257DCCFC56DE1C222B17EA080E11C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
0x24CE0016C4F1A68B9080A29EDBEB4987
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
0x27AE9725407D9F069E900262AE1C5195
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
0x16868DE386DB3C8DD3508089343CFEA1
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
0x0B8D6B7BDAC753EF14A26CE194F9DB0D
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
0x4159349A30216828FA86794FBD998D58
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
0x50BCFE8227AEE7D7BAC78B9565EEFE29
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
0x50617388AABEE0885E19A7EE2541E170
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
0x30DD2F4FC8E1FA074A2DDA80493B2C3A
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
0x118FAED8DF9D09882050454F5C4B2A6B
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
0x957482E2631E05EED292B0641909936F
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
0xB265AF25F9DEAD1DB41F0071DF08BF76
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
0x2296F214046D8F3A2BA758252D10BCA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
0x5973119BED7ECCD4DAD133EC75A0BA65
to him, but do not give my name."
0x312AAF01B7B04410B83694A221562154

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
0x75A24892C80151CE59998DFC6A5E12B1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
0x87B4A261D9436D0326626B0322943146
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
0x3A085BB26FA2A9B2C4E0356848095E14
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
0xDB55C63A710DB2B2276EDA7339A57C75

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
0x213F00B177FDA42A6946E67855ABB176

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
0x96A2F88AFDDE830A905B15EBC5B113F9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
0xD9C2FE801F4932E43B22D22A93CDB622

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
0x374A40506BCA74FFCFFE063FC8E1B31A
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
0xAFA13AD8385B9928C0D1A90BA0186E2B
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
0xE7422F2E613F034D026B50CE64451DEB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
0x49873ECD60D7C523A7A1CB3E3D2F30EE
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
0xCB959B4CF0141D48364AE20B3FD885DF
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
0x560FB890E46B88581D27D09DF9E4A51D
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
0xBD3DB56F52A72A920FF3288C6CD13A29
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
0xB752A49A0E36EFE9CFCCEF32E59F2C56
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
0x061AD4F129781560F78A3DC6A7B03CC2
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
0xB614D2D1981C14173D695496A9A44E92
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
0x77D4BC298D0AF4611ABEA4514A93D697
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
0x197FB0C60960A785D5D6108CE17C1FA6
nothing, he returned and sighed.
0x7D5F467E7B4C5B72A54F92C0A9D394F2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
0x4C9D347158FF027BBD1FC22276397359

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
0xA8F2D7D661A904C6210D06BB6906390A
still excited.
0xFB619A6571974043A59D1C19E6B85C71

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
0xAFEC325D8E78EEEA57CE43225905EE51

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
0x2B79D3D9C571CD104E955A0EB9C1111A
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
0x004030C9117A9D4B398BD724C899E404
you, Mary, is it not?"
0x92FADFFE710B5D75F346C2DE55EB06F6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
0xA539E94F21B630EFBEE2C7A2C3ED8DCE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
0xE9D8D492DDC01CAC3846CEC4B558B569
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
0xD7A1D9107B39BE31AF301228755434AF
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
0xE5DA9BBFD6E1E81709A56145480FF95E
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
0x9D4214CB698F874445E0ABFA3EE21929
and aloud.
0x45AA45A4DC4465F2F47881E6E534FB16

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
0x1347A8EFE14DF201B52FFF341FD9F6F7
glass," I said.
0xD0430CFAE36BCD803AD4B538AD94478F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
0xD8510E99544B2C1143616060882B1816

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
0x2D325B1179B22FEA26092D4E2F3913EF
evening," I answered.
0xFC534EB8C3F994732460EB86BAFAC541

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
0x706AAE68E873A87A928D6047153AAE23
seized me?"
0xDADFEF564AB55C7DD41B040A68687942

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
0x2D1E435F29A70C4EAD41F6A8746CFA0A
your health too sound for frenzy."
0x47E2FE65235770232879D2DFDFB6796C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
0xC7A42CFC9EEDF543EB8988D65D2AB1EC
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
0x35B49ADB3FDD614CDA680C9807C882F3
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
0x21C7DCF5CD38772A713DF076F8A5E1B2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
0xF40B1AAA054C42EA8F90B8E000085A42

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
0xBAC46D4574D6B4C3BC5783B90E8CB32D
must be more of her."
0x0B56F76B798FB5BCB7AE6EF15C05D762

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
0xAB95CEABACACD993BD1D41DD24A46816
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
0x5D5F682BDA2D1E86E2C802384976530C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
0x8F71B91F5CC555270BE73EA72A817AA3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
0x8DFB6097471EBEB28C247713DFAB48A4
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
0x397359A6A40695D4098E42D89407ED17

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
0x3AAC65794F927A37C889C2AC52591E64

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
0x54828924760B272C119087FDE17FAD8B
come back to you."
0xFFC6BCDE6A6386058AD84D627C59A5A2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
0x3ED98F497A3437E88E3AE8D58751C488
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
0x6789A33EB569F06B2A59C1B464D73EFE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
0xFE23F58403A8DC59B6D39C5D603BB224
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
0xECFA39B8480C169FCCC5BBCDBD4EF323
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
0x24632AC9E1E69B4127B7DF16D179897D
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
0xE7F6B4060FE7EA56F380D5FB3E66EB08
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
0xFA0AF33F56E923FF76FA7580B3AE4745

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
0x380A229B5969120A6D6AF1C42AB84AD3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
0xF818F8C41D87C59A13A0ED91E635D09C
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
0xECF5E6B7CC0C17C7081A2EE5BF725B3A
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
0x34C0FB2FF0C1DDBAD5456E93AB967496
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
0xEDFBE0E0E9D5CF2C64822F3648257E59
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
0x5E6DE8BA02CED39F00D8FC4FD6A42800
you go--embrace me, Jane."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
0x8D38AA32640D4A22C51E5C51E04B4CFD
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
0x34DED830E43B07B10EDBD28B4028C5B6
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
0x4CB6E356F110DEEB7AE04295976D9928

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"

piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
0x55104F4ADD20B8B95A3EEA9EB6B1F495
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
0x570E83BEA0C4A2840912DE94F920606F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
0x5E1F8F608323AE200C7FBF2AE06BFDB8
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
0xB6AF21FE3FF81068786E9A2CD8A4CBE6
company of an evening."
0x4E5D3D761CE68CEE67B8DEEFEA84DC08

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
0xF20F25C29DB65FF86ECA02D6DE46BE85
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
0x0BD845200EB8BB59D70D7489F869D901
me?"
0xEEDD836EEEDD836EC126337F5C6039E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
0x7577C89BDE3C1D5044958656EDCA214D
mistress."
0x9E2837E3C9EAA5CD1A5499A96D290273

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you will stay with me?"
0x8D88CFCE1CD2206CD2C5ADEC64FDB270

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
0x34E006854E1427D1D897B9AF200B70CE
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
0x8A387297ED20911F79F3F1C29C0AA3F2
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
0x65C31543236CF77456CB9DB38ACF0811
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
0xB6518D1C8681233C82C2DA814AD4767C
be left desolate, so long as I live."
0x68A2C1E82990AEB4685094D5E96A33AB

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
0x639470A6710E2310CBB9BC4F0FCE4384
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
0x8058161CD071016C5F7AD383E36AE218
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
0xD7B8454C52AB501EE327F8EFFBD4E265
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
0x4702EAFBFA007A855B4A8F45436564F3
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
0x7FF43C9CF92A8FCBE508662EEB5DB1A9
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
0x5984D6C511637F17D45E6CBBA45B5C06
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
0x8D1CF3DD2F40384D6343A80E24113ECE
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
0xA82DA4F16754432A1D92A385DF496D91
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
0xB457F74D8CA93A427E69E50BC85FE9C0
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
0x5D3C0C38687690A809CA5AA623F8522A
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
0x23569D3636CF7D63D351EFA5B12FE708

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
0x47B6F6DC5B63A3275B45DB1D2602CA42
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
0x601AEA7227E8635488C1463FB8BA8A59
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
0x90889BACDBFB8C2C473E4DDF19F8B063
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
0xAFE81726128B25569880EF0681F5369C
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
0xF9AA5AD42EB082D085735446A53DC7AB
vengeance on its frame."
0x3895B7A0167FE6E77C07BC8A2447D8BC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
0xCC80CDE50B26D173F4034851EA0711BD

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
0x583D2C6FC5FA1959AD45EA9C2EB3D4A6
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
0xB062771D8C7E7A9C9E4F0A11B7775DC8
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
0xC677D9052B0CB2513CECA152D9D94598
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
0x36F1A4F210B9300765E87BFE997C306D
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
0x6C3151E09C106610BCE58707112568B1
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
0x11D055817D98DF86F93A4D3F50A200BE
Come--tell me."
0xB34D61653DF786F616A04352BAAD1CE8

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
0x13856A246B526F31A9F490002FC7D954
you think it better."
0x74089DCFFB6C68DC021B77234CE26FA4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
0xBEE181664BE79F1F69976B6834AEB48B
one day."
0xED0B853E68941D8403A257CD01D35F1B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I don't care about being married."
0x52A7A316E136336D55643EBC2E8FC79A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
0xD3AC73582EDF8C458A30CD29C0FBCC05
you care--but--a sightless block!"
0x7A7F455BA7B6BDD7A01E12E7E51834F4

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
0xC70C3049C92ABAD9230A1D5810EEE794
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
0x0097523B636823F40098A934AE52DBBE
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
0xF3C96E5563BA730EF5B49A5389143457
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
0x17E5F9278249B225A7FC48DD6DFF973D
conversation.
0xE9178CF6BC3D99FC93CAF0948BE8735F

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
0xD00D1B262CB265E3E8C95539A383D97E
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
0x05C0EF7CB190D9E37CB7C44762242E27
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
0x25921323EBAB5B3BAB4710D5A717A942
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
0xBC28B2C4C0693F63D78160D0C5F6BB79
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
0x5DBDB3C3607F94A245E054BF9D6EF76D
not yet noticed."
0xEEEF7F9D8F230842AA88DE4144C4A2C6

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
0x14EE269E7295FFBC635022E9356589B8
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
0xC1813E2C18CB3EDBE84453E4A66B0CB3
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
0x8DA33CF5A5210767957417FE49D5BCBF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
0xC631854A4AF857D6C89E382BE3D0DEE1
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
0xEC082796FF6C3C48A9019CC3ED1FE357
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
0xC887061CCED02F60D59623D611B17FB2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
0x9F83A0E9FFB40F76176DB4D81B289620
cicatrised visage."
0x496D1AA3F50985E2F2FB0D28E197B0BE

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
0x028BC5AE93A9034C89B037FE24201F28
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
0xC0B394C5BAEC64EFDF85E2DCB9099D0E
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
0xF28DA06B64BDA4E4A7AACCEF2B62D1F7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
0x98D782744AB4B465BC506236E79E66EF

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And you see the candles?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"When do you take supper?"

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I never take supper."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
0xD19B32C5DFD5C310BF3743ADC1830CBF
only you forget."
0x38128A0932A3B0F79FD075E665039E14

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
0xF8E17396EE15344C37A8982722DF4EC0
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
0x6B8B4961F07E11EB2B4A1FC131CDC9D0
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
0x2D5598C3D9FB3980F9DC7D43A71C744C
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
0xDE9DF18DFD09394AFC0F98A186BC7720
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
0x6448CC500EA7DFC39E664B031AF6C276
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
0x140DC1D23D014C315C5A36B846ED89BA
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
0xBF05375983978F8A6A4C59EC1BD492F5
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
0x82B430998E28D12BEBBF409BEDD33479
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
0xA4AA9BC691A3A41E0D850D4F4DD5DAE0
lineaments softened and warmed.
0xE4E37937DE6F8207E42BC3C7B2F35C30

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
0x324A36CCF2AABF4E69084E837F808066
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
0x15103AFF387C7B6AA6AAF056E1440D40
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
0xDB14B10277C7D4FE68AE12EF695A2E69
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
0x033CDCDF387A230FAD3DC1E8175E81F1
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
0xB30645D47BD74950687B7927606B9127
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
0xAB47FC753EFE379A0331953801603723
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
0x08E628E8F62ECAE765E2A215F589F4E1
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
0x2B144C4465648D798050AE69C0A39885
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
0xB9B7869F985B1E06DA2C6E82C946112A
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."

Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
0x96E1D5D27F96E4C5A40D7105C0F7A662
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
0x6D859FD8E44F2B8A87FFD54140AAB6C3
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
0x4FCEE55661C5C76DDF63F492D3CA1F1D
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
0xC09546CDD0DB785C810B40E06B91846D
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
0x0069573E89A2A2862B0768B4DEB52702
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
0x3B833A825303893D2A1364FF347805CF
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
0x96D60DE621B1B125FBC68BB32867989E
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."

A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
0x47F487DC889EB47F1A044D941E29A1B4
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
0xF542C84E02F13913B9109C6EFCF4B13C
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
0xAA7F6C8DE7498681132E9FB6C6837FF2
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
0xAE6A51F8FA17C474D66FC0E4B6A280A6
them grow as broad and black as ever.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
0x406D6DF5C94B1CE3DACED81C11808D28
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
0x40FBE661C2A99210CA5716B319B73032
of his melancholy for some time to come."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
0xE3F7D1A92B63D22EA8AAF512FE7D10A6
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
0x49C37366517DC04B00300A8BF4DCE8CA
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
0xC5043631547483F6E9D34B13750D8D85
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
0x8BF75D1E282C16BFE50BCEAACCB2CBC5
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
0x3B65DA579D2556837A592AC969085471
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
0x31F07E9FABF99A0D7351022A897D8C0C
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
0x5C72B776CCC68BA0CEF4C3F4A8A98514
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
0x10ACAC9B6C522A886872EBB0316CD6F4
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
0x80DC37F5BC11AF98217D287BE844EE08
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
0x7457D28E53CAC3CB06E0B6ABAD5DB1D0
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
0x59829FAE019BB572E5F3214B4E0BD46B
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
0xFD7D5B9933E69EB7526A66522A5791DC
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
0x1A394D2026B579281BB1F1B879E35B86
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
0x5B3A983C668A87D6733D88DE4D92DB3B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
0xEF3B00FECA2AA39217E3C8D30B533C1C
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
0x21B555B3F5716DE3863A3F202D3334B6
soon."
0x51719C5751719C57956018B032F073E0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
0x47F02F43B59FD488F039A408FCA91032

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
0x84E9BBB7F5091AC5C70EDFB2C20AF081
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
0x310A94C5A0EEA218B8729CD8A3F05346
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
0x383FB6E7F2BC531159FE1F50E4317106
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
0xF20F8D1CD83CEE4B18DD149AEA01D07C
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
0xDC5C3EF8AB64DA0F8201761242804D88
can feel is in her presence."
0x84F06EE5587450C9DB1DDE6AEF2FBD19

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
0x8D7FC46D8EC0B8781CC603EA2AA726B0
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
0x3D24563B5429AC350C9664E941330343
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
0xC8EEDACE1DD5297B07C04D29D9D93683
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
0x01656BB8F1D628A7B3746F36973EC05C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
0xE0ED820326951DDE0425148A89CB399E
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
0x2271E144B9CF43718C75497C6013BF13
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
0xAF79737C698EB340EAD42413BD961223
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
0xFC4DC0FA62A5625E5AD577E9522910D6
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
0x3A7DAD8FEA991C3339624803B2E6F5C7
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
0xFE7D9F291E8CEE72ED4C004B92711EEA
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
0x7F400689AE10123DEAADEDBC2AA31346
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
0x2F5566DABC6AD035B74D90DE018E4CB5

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
0xE5E578998CAA36224003BA5FEE52B667
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
0xADD4B51D59435F5EF5E3857AB8F5CE3B
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
0x49B25EF60FBEA4261316F891F1D36824
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
0x6F28AE0D60A02B7D21D28B7BEFBFFC3F
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
0x66FB3666F4876FCCF311853673475F21
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
0xD75B887F430D78B9EFC34084D3CB8ACC
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
0x14EBA40F7803A8192186E26D2109A5B5
she do?  Let me hear now."
0xCE962504560CD749248F1C5B9E4BEAA9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
0x7326744E3A5241142495E442772733CC
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
0x9CDDFEE560773760E6240CBE5BAA14E7
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
0x6F6992CE7220C4297A04EDD9700673B2
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
0x08B02A9DB58633A979449DC0B66E6133
deeper than I wished.
0x8ED8D4D80F2069159D3C8940B7EA2BB7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
0x5F0FE2DBCDD9A91713D4BB4F655DDBC7
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
0x59E20A653DEBA67D09427FE1419F32FB
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
0xB8FC4B72DDD37C0A64315318CDD2BA02
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
0x81F285C3E6F88A54DED0313499B5AAFE
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
0x4B715A52022626825768F55980BA1E6D
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
0x28EB5AFD0EAD6B8D42C22B4C209574AA
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
0xB82A41AB0E9F80B924BB07CCAF67B3CA
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
0x4BC94340F973DCC5E8E4A526B2E2BE5B

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
0xCF30648AC9F54442E1F8A9D65AB18832
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
0xDF262E9A0224819EE035FD41D8C4115B
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
0x1C29ED6555B131B46E2C85CB4C044876
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
0x860610F956982036AB2AB62B784F0B86
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
0x6BE49B57E6F4F91C13A1BEEB53016228
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
0x39E025E667581C82DD8DDE3C909EC1EB
up.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
0xAC3DCFCAEB96D383A1F4DA23485B750A
Or what does it mean?"
0x6EF4F3720E23CBBBD1D2A05EE30DC660

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0xD53C31C324D51154F9A347A4F76607F9

0x87FB69F3EB00445CF648BB346F13E87A

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they

sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
0x98030803212FAFFF729382030170D90E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
0xAD26D672A764C6420B326F6ABA418E14
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
0xBD748E57D2C600C92204398D49AE0545
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
0x8731C02173A35871CEF101CD9E06CF7A
immediately charm the snake.

"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
0x1E060C0E811946F12D46DC1BFCFC8598
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a

graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-

beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
0xE1B975A5DAF588463DF771D00833978B
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
0xD2948E796022A87F8308A870914AAB60
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an

0x79481EC46AC4C4018D692A8439BD5825
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental

points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
0x3C454935671253CC5B84AAA306E1F904

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but

you and Rivers?"
0x5194E481BC35D59C2E5A42C5005E605E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
0xD8F3DFFF7C1051CC6443971C79408BF7
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
0x6CCFA60ACABE01B0BA8C13A7F4B54B30
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
0x907D5321FD39EAC51C33C4C8209072B0
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
0x84962479B62F6EB58404E7ED69CA037E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
0x1D6DE69DD963517FD29EABD2C9B34512
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
0x0CD43AFF7F558E4D041A090EA2DD7B71
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
0x94C73C8FFFAF9328269C5FC88F974FDD
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
0x2B3F5DC547BD470E8A52B4428C5B72FB
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to

bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
0x2A9E32B11D5A21F28A9559D87B86AD0C

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and

vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
0x003471B1B77E8282312B0CC90091B0C4
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
0x89F161DBA80830297CD48EDD8EF5C6E0
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
0x32640F77003321605C2AD9E90095466E
offers them so safe a prop."

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
0xDD72DFD49CEE79325D338A6D14B5353E
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He

helped me.

wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed

guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
0xC485E2758DCF25E52DA08CF64A791E5D

of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has

humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it

now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
0x7A5F0FAD1A4FE8D420F2D296FA91FDC7

0x2EC0A39E6AFABB3B700B5ACFD0DF538C
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
0x6C3FA37508D43CD141C495A55E99C9B9
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
0x60F1D0DBD934BF7CD2E7CA2C1FD02BCB

sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere

eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
0xEE4106A9DBA1EF6266A12346EAFEC40D
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this

0xEFB23A7B0521BC5E74FFABEE2F676EC9
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
0xD4686FA67CB0D5A593BEC7B9CE82BB69
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
0x8E3CD613A8175FE634A735A94B98500D
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long

enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and

peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I

for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where

are you?'

buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies

unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I

heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
0xAAD0CD6B66A6051C9CAAC55EA3FAB95A
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
0x9ED45E465F5839C32BE45C4CF94ECBAB
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
0x137B520326F8D7F3440D90E4FBAB835B
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
0xB36F92F4D162CCF1DAA6528E18D2B9E2
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were

Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
0x9E593F77DC37BDB0EE15088CD3C89113
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
0x811D7D74E70316AD66BCCE78728B6892
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
0xD3F50C3574260E62B190FE72B84DE3B1
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
0x4D04DB5A649C048A6CA78FA719E73765
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
0x0612E712BB9077509DC2981E4B757DDD
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
0x7A3C27815FC9072F4BA390E78C63028E
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
0x919DA0A1F6A8959CAE981E8EB1B1FCDA
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
0xC5A7E8B4524EA776031C0FEB13BAAB80
them in my heart.

"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me

than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and

annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted

Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
0xEE43C606A5D632C5BBB3D01426EC574F
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
0x517649C717F1654201DF0399F038FB94
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
0x9416DC45705DFF28BA70F878A53FDA4C
entered the wood, and wended homeward.

CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
0x7028D723892A712A4E559D668DF1AFDC

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
0xF6E2EF21DDAE0A11B4E1473C31D24CA6
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
0xDBD59E6D76B02341CF0EE5CA01A27E33
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
0x49B0B6EBB92A843C0526847BAF84F84A
cleaning the knives, and I said--
0xFF7810D2117E3B22217724DB71640E23

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
0x1D9C6054E3E92DF76F04255E0A78D684
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
0x152EF17DAD3251790521A524A351A2DF
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
0xBD1AB670340EE3615F50B45AB522F081
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
0xA86D4751286CA25F54A24F94CB9804FC
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
0x31A757278CCDD28E69B8F517D27357DE
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
0x5B36385895A74E5B7A468A6D9776CF90
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
0x44440809265A8D019890A6EBB17E2FB6
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
0xFF4F83B26D59B1BF814BE489BE313CEF
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
0x24113696CB719DD391E4EBE39EAFC6FC
again over the roast, said only--
0x9BA22CE0470467AEC5B70278EE5B2BA9

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
0xA4338F789824C8CFA2297726EFD49D74

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
0x9B85C822778A81C8375C35CCF10D4008
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
0x2288A02E56D93C2BEC2FDE7EE9F7624F
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
0xF37D9C2A822DBB479C69E7099B23B096

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
0x492CCF4D915549CADD9129AB2DA13DFA
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
0x68E61B1082FF2B4DB82F2A983DCBC33B
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
0x7FE1691BB1AC666AC6A2D6AE1CF11DA1
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
0x8BB5464B881BB7487AB01506CC7D6DDC
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
0x7985A0CD975EA350675731EDEC39B683
politely pulled his forelock.
0xA8B9BEDD521A856CB80A451DE940008D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
0x61673FB15CD4B483429CF5FB52F28F92
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
0xE278ACCCD78BD98C864F714E8A8857F5
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
0x03769F2E1EF2AF3A44BA7B356BD5B76E
caught the words--
0xBB55904786A93918917D55B352C99BC3

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
0x87A135186C70182398A29AE0675A0017
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
0x65E20129F7021DEC8455B6D1A0F2FC1E
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
0x52866AA15B6DDD001D562BBC52B8E7F1

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
0x3AB30BE10C1584F4CF7E5A85A7EC71EC
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
0x1AC0B2DB6308623C7A7DA4033E76A810
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
0xDA669460444F746F4E35751BE40935F0
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
0xECDC963B98BDE5F9AD73351C040CB5ED

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
0x7D054A68A23D29EBAB4093EBFE07FC0E
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
0x1CB99E7CB9A2AF33F27C02CBEA765968
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
0xBCAFE931895B6FF84035E44F632672ED
grave or mine."
0x30A2ACE56BA1BC410319E26B902AC028

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
0xCF80A7C384D8DF43492CFD1598F307F4
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
0x8CC25872B21AC2D349CBCC70D46DA332
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
0xC23BADF8AF029D5C55088EDC5A7C4BF6
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
0x47D9D39C633111C2DE3551E4BAC58872
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
0xF41FF370C58AA048BB95966871F90C07
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
0xF60072A24D7A67526B7A8931ED01DF13
the world, and only mind earthly things.
0x5EF11D2B02D6E31D744DCA2E779FA2C7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
0x873EAE02A87BBE0703B6F6FEFB8C0BF8
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
0x6CDD3DBE352CA8A9B147DBAF5F114417
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
0xB7E6A12F6D6A5319C12E02CF7A19EE54
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
0x7AA7BB4E4EB4FA8720F31E937E92E772
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
0x94FDE18CA721A2A52ED4BCCBCA8C2502
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
0x9C772D54F290F5CE5AF8BDDECE72911F
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
0x701B33B6AB182111AB0C2171546FC7CD
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
0x1749E5019FD5A2D60B6C51699748F5F7
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
0x1BC09F06D8823C59E1D1BC06A7E4BD73
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
0x8605E4E5F26A92CB898EDB2E4838BA81
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
0x0FE8CBF21DE63D02681DBAC0836FB045
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
0x1D6F736B547D1D4B00AE271F351C4811
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
0x08313D15E4C4DCFCCDAA70E319F30802
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
0x63F21F5980730A35A94F41CAA5C8BA50
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
0x7D4EFE74A7AAFC6419D872F884423B68
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
0x2C958FD5AB7D0D3BE87BE5D2558A7898
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
0x3F151516846B5AAF337A0D27E44EBDA4
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
0x08A5133A1C0012844E886C8020754F3E

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
0x8F1FCE4E5D08948BC63E580AE5424406
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
0x6F9E7887013F87C2764E059AD744D3E5
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
0x096F3A28399AEDED2DEF2885891B1E91

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
0xAAFC6DFE8A16ECDA9DC059205A2BA23E
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
0x9A972627D368F0B770BC0B1E2A8E2891
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
0xF910053C819851255587D7764F217702
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
0xD140087FB8CB3F9AE22A75A18C105BCA
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
0xD2A8B3551AB1BC0622F27E3A25519342
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
0xB535C49949BF8FB4A2BC25883CDEFE58
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
0x8574DD01CF8482CF12F6E29B00462D28
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
0xCDCD77CE799153F00FAAC361D17F399F
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
0x075E181BE086BBD9523C6498615EEF88
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
0xA3D45D07E35001EF5EC13DD46C82F4E2
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
0x8B43D31C55A5FA0C298649862F1ED688
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
0x6664079CA197720BD1664083AEBCC4EA
concord is the result.
0xF59CB55E59890E35F3CE7E97CEE75C35

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
0x142908DC8FA0933FF48CAA89541EA9C9
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
0x7293ABD26086011054B12529AA2AB3D2
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
0xE415E144EAE27366314C6665D5332EEE
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
0x5A3AAAC933EB8231A4A0CEE106B1FC26
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
0x50D5A820F081672C0C75627105068F95
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
0x6314629DCF94924ACC53F4F8A571D8F2
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
0x082C020EB04663D2280311EB1CDBE131
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
0x61429000CF5D10F5C22063494B949A37
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
0xC421B75AE9FE70CF7D75D6A2375FCCCC
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
0xB0C11A89E18DA08E02A2F9366EE38BEC
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
0xF7195429345C6DF9FFB9E522B6E9B925
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
0x50678FFFE6BBF78B27D2A7B6BB767C37
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
0xA78A7B388BC2F43063AA7EB3EEE4BF5B
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
0x1B85A6DB1E96F8EB1E8A17B8782805E5
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
0xA3A6F4F1767881D22FD281B47E701486

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
0xC409263D686E6A23EAC920553B300FBB
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
0x2772837FADF0D3B4E609208610A98417
glittering ornament round your neck?"
0xAD7EF706CEF89A43DB18A24C9664D247

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
0x1DEDF2B1E6AADC5ABCB47AD91AB60AC2

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
0xF6702C3B9DCD80D855FFE420755897F0

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
0xB190DA3BACEDD397D095926FA3797CC7

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
0x894DF166996FCF0925E817307766FC54
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
0xBFE76751E1FB91A8369C6ECDF72D2E77
sure of it.
0xF0FE1F5B0CDE03685BB325B0CD70681D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
0x0C8AB7F416EF442551363FEEB8273949
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
0x48F21BECA81D4C64ACDDF956B7A0ABC6
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
0x49C7D4C962A514BC871B46A16BCDE9AE
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
0xBB254483142F972F2582DEF0D2488D54
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
0x4C127BC8AB6ECCCE138BAD0E33486CF5
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
0x0FDFED6C3A9CEFB3923469BB2F473664
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
0xDDF59DE52AA4D15FBB0FC0301F7B4A79
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
0x43E5FED2D99C729A25DF7E2F961A995D

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
0x4AAB7E5C547A68A5017123CF5AD83251
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
0x386289E42814DFFFA9BE00E10D3C9F43
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
0xB0E4455861C603A97D631989BDD1D1FC
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
0x18EB4CA561D7B2E113A9D4ACD22E550B
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
0x7CD91881E2B0BD485E216E9306FCA451
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
0x6E76E89159F8B8365186B55471049F53
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
0x04ED80C580CD35F6EA4B5145689202FA

0x87596F1787596F1787596F17051BEC24
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
0x1D969AB05DF7C4895F909958C7AB64AE
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
0x168808F69F96657B3D99BCE6F74DBA16
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
0x4A1C5FD1D1B0CE6CF4BCB3847D5CCB84
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
0x705DF276787AB10A33F343EA89B48C0E
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
0x890F3293244794A76F4D722FD8E5A618
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
0x61C887397196C3D431918D01663C66A8
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
0xC2164568C1A0538E788F7FCA7A8B6DF2
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
0x1B15E2223627A512B3DF71EE2A31E26F
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
0xD8D635C8D8B10A31EE48FD0EF93C6796
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
0x4F2C6E06C8866C60BECBA452E5D71D68
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
0x2934A603383EAF23AE872F32740C629D
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
0xD8E07B86F71342675A8F9B6A4AB36205
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
0x225202D015328307538B3A7AF6AD9501
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
0xBD8F41999E8E970737DC13FEFB7831D9
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
0x19FF3282A7252C32ACA9E80656F02B7F

St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
0xD10B08820142B3F748F3B6D3B2660271
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
0x09478A86F9D6FFEF82EF1156B7CDB711
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
0x07EBE2BAF8ED68FE15FA2AE2C4BD8800
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
0x8D2192A1BF12A3BF559D9B20C59F09B0
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
0x3D14D1E660D567C9E426362B6E2DFB53
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
0xD563DBE4CE6D509DD6C9D2020DA2C28D
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
0x0CF22E72DF9705222D26CED037B5D8E1
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
0x366C38897828CE50D6F39A48FC153E92
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
0x2E43907007E54189CCA468B7A24AB75A
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--

"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
