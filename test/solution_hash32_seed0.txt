PREFACE
1300325532

-1840324437

-1840324437
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
2026664536
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
-183610097
miscellaneous remark.
-2147186397

-1840324437
My thanks are due in three quarters.
-361213908

-1840324437
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
-1989497651
few pretensions.
1990458675

-1840324437
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
1215973281
obscure aspirant.
-1651292915

-1840324437
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
277765110
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
119748878
Author.
1564693881

-1840324437
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
695426915
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
-59523124
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
-993392491
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
86911827
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
-1907242011
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
532151130

-1840324437
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
1985104320
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
-1514069599
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
1498905398
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
-629884999
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
489696831
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
-840408475
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
-1546375257
would remind them of certain simple truths.
-1116605535

-1840324437
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
-552788457
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
1176331680
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
-1061929053
Thorns.
625187331

-1840324437
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
-1410461639
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
1892031963
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
1569806003
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
-1230022996
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
-9087652
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
-860485717
and clearly the line of separation between them.
107094333

-1840324437
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
-374070231
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
1230687214
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
-790435509
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
-2147172998
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
-780343412
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
-856691711

-1840324437
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
-1134891370
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
-819815290
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
1769382172
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
537268719

-1840324437
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
-2030773425
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
1866962518
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
-772321783
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
-1017931275
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
-1706593894
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
-682012069
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
1351875942
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
-1739106389
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
-2066521557
Rimoth-Gilead.
-541434413

-1840324437
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
2122944120
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
-970693908
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
128407187
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
-198390250
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
1391186534
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
-517282012
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
793222976
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
-855233477
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
501015288
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
2097345898
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
104143476
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
414737414
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
-1744044803
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
1586933347
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
1701091877

-1840324437

-1840324437
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
-280383753
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
-526251434
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
-2093015824
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
-155657993
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
-1959856018
denied where it is justly due.
1903122755

-1840324437
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
-561896529
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
623235947

-1840324437

-1840324437
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
1932452777
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
2116846411
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
1911158400
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
-1336051262
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
-487252441

-1840324437
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
-590590502
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
-1656619783
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
-1444133007
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
-2143174136
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
-288822261

-1840324437
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
-1403615570
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
-127113588
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
1472255487
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
102449311
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
1455017476
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
-247969870
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
-1142348811
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
566987237
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
-53808388
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
-1789821104
little children."
-1800003692

-1840324437
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
1766772707

-1840324437
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
-1933466629
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
-794492577
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
-857241660

-1840324437
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
1608976762
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
-1234496091
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
2136446396
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
-82578097
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
-1364615552
retirement.
1448628013

-1840324437
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
663691567
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
-139957687
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
1220267200
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
-113336633
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
-73906189
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
49491569
lamentable blast.
1563958301

-1840324437
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
1148611800
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
92785493
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
-1788461558
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
-61191421
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
399753317
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
1435016397
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
94608482

-1840324437
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
697271346
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
-804078042
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
-1102718623
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
1972894604

-1840324437
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
1674295620
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
-1267273466
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
-1707221402
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
873803534
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
834112048
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
-196755594
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
-662156967
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
-1531256792
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
1259886769
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
-805406324
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
828614034
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
-526846717
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
526713032

-1840324437
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
-298384187
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
1951410130
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
5679084
hour of eventide.
-2063722925

-1840324437
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
2111011635

-1840324437
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
-490991991
quickly: it was an object of terror.
-185673613

-1840324437
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
143439601
crowd surrounding a gallows.
269561682

-1840324437
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
130949558
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
-33046764
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
500006897
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
-1712560831
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
1632731629
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
-1882561131
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
-1690313354
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
249937566
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
252516426

-1840324437
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
-1963829753
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
2127071681
room door opened.
167476881

-1840324437
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
-59527880
found the room apparently empty.
1454102636

-1840324437
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
430547052
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
-1073044726
animal!"
1462908462

-1840324437
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
-1081034476
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
1933005
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
-826502812
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
1154642437

-1840324437
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
250576912

-1840324437
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
430561328
forth by the said Jack.
1390886759

-1840324437
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
714480526

-1840324437
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
-1791508242
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
-400181988
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
-2096709117

-1840324437
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
-651651657
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
-1484910884
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
-1004018679
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
787949707
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
-1972334590
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
28853196
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
1732125520
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
-1021535127
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
-1996587686
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
1600831969
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
-1853401592
home.
-618697104

-1840324437
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
-1108855682
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
-1040399934
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
917924732
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
410454240
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
1654654425
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
-1399717080
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
-882610089
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
2025847279
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
1124658641
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
-856552123
her back.
348526284

-1840324437
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
1939861704
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
1130440656
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
141717403
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
-127108694
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
1568384472
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
-2026715626
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
1096966337
chair.
-1877587537

-1840324437
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
-1898348541
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
-1827675859
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
1820127144

-1840324437
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
1671942883
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
-741135212
insult.
-1945007501

-1840324437
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
-1399276034

-1840324437
"I was reading."
-1940558173

-1840324437
"Show the book."
-1280667465

-1840324437
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
-930356373

-1840324437
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
-958660884
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
-1652301618
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
-335347937
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
-661754651
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
-1048706280
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
1755915955
the mirror and the windows."
-1103940356

-1840324437
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
-324429645
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
-883396453
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
451019949
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
1574617675
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
1725822486
climax; other feelings succeeded.
-158033510

-1840324437
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
684139254
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
1505030868

-1840324437
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
1376814165
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
-2061895579
thought thus to have declared aloud.
-118711835

-1840324437
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
-1968419076
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
1255685117

-1840324437
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
-112461916
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
-1070834791
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
-1156629854
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
-1795771029
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
1647244102
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
-1025759820
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
-704921905
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
-1211962398
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
492933655

-1840324437
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
1641863560

-1840324437
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
-1788150333

-1840324437
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
166500325

-1840324437
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
-1815926172
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
351684077

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER II
-1485225404

-1840324437

-1840324437
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
-467504569
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
156831788
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
-1334439106
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
2024165949
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
1281053999
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
-1307434333

-1840324437
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
-774248842

-1840324437
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
-2049597547
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
1574894475
young master."
-1444413781

-1840324437
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
-2004959480

-1840324437
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
-2018386580
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
-1277565005

-1840324437
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
-2055751337
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
-342723091
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
1195989162

-1840324437
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
-2130138718
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
1321990292

-1840324437
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
2025640404
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
1946004649
little of the excitement out of me.
792663200

-1840324437
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
1858599500

-1840324437
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
-1255870975

-1840324437
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
-1343315264
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
-180730595
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
-205094503
incredulous of my sanity.
198961884

-1840324437
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
-606462246

-1840324437
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
-1821640036
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
1180321215
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
475561626

-1840324437
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
-113100816
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
-1468884842
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
1476664483

-1840324437
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
-1643876180
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
-995205235
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
225755656
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
-168366290

-1840324437
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
-645355724
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
-600907570
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
1066593386
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
1246781792
them."
775584318

-1840324437
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
-1214240714
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
-536388035
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
1215404268
away, I am sure."
-1905868314

-1840324437
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
-380165145
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
2053575291
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
-938433656
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
13348244
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
2053276176
fetch you away."
1458198966

-1840324437
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
2127954747

-1840324437
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
-253088949
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
705589818
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
976518001
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
-1203893842
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
-1350482925
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
-909723063
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
-1157464166
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
312264759
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
-815458072
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
-1877517466
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
1846103476
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
-866847798
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
-1944510657
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
1670625222
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
-1137511745
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
617649658

-1840324437
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
-1462436885
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
198239280
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
1796543029
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
-1350595768
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
87401131
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
1397465554
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
706975902
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
79337661
in spite of its grandeur.
2075589247

-1840324437
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
-926356033
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
229070085
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
1244311109
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
881498692

-1840324437
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
263917176
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
94851342
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
-654583394
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
1541587188
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
1962460657
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
-639104459
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
-1023145681
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
-1698999667
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
-223208547
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
1505634043
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
-1088790287
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
440301400
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
1537443877
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
-1547328750
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
-733453909
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
-1795079561

-1840324437
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
-114338718
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
-897147689
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
-383082207
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
921826375

-1840324437
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
987975991
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
1994742290
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
-1975702840
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
-740577448
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
1003474183
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
588972745
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
1947708872
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
-933390765
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
-1178767173
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
-666064059
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
1274432101
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
312163465
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
-454195543
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
1764917799
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
-451329317
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
-1759371517
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
-1087539796
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
-1233563389
night.
394614694

-1840324437
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
-909173443
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
1687746116
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
1777201143
general opprobrium.
1489715687

-1840324437
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
1458038262
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
1189389722
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
-1387976654
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
2002011669
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
-1750322711

-1840324437
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
254232798
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
185018485
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
1981819907
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
-88650244
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
-1149130691

-1840324437
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
1182849670
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
-541427152
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
-791411975
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
-813729973
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
-1428919891
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
200829010
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
1177605313
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
447410698
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
-1491231091
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
299346731
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
-1731900388
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
1930882287
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
680685883

-1840324437
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
2028746092
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
-1355519341
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
1029311269
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
1691889340
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
214287679
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
-1684528560
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
-58057227
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
-1515640847
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
1032198452
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
-1212969629
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
-37687762
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
-1794148932
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
-1990462476
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
1960955508
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
2080990730
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
-241874931
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
-1716341672
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
-300494172
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
-2015218237
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
-2039347811
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
729293302
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
1754868386

-1840324437
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
694462580
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
-1393874162
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
-1115853445
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
1183251904
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
1821905023
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
574668016
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
1679593803
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
118154383
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
536321288
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
-1256036379
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
2006427609
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
1875632260
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
-621719822
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
78242362
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
1107195284
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
1778795352
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
-2109538210
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
958651535
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
-1088780284
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
1314768747
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
113635349
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
-439657472
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
1748634126
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
855560218
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
1067196737
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
-202544922
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
176210614
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
418996147
Abbot entered.
592105628

-1840324437
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
337541738

-1840324437
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
1578851909

-1840324437
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
-617105231

-1840324437
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
-222799517
Bessie.
850624010

-1840324437
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
-1464557698
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
-2022889015

-1840324437
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
-190896665
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
1915088080
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
-282032076

-1840324437
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
2059871200
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
-1041763494
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
311943711
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
558489329

-1840324437
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
1480004764

-1840324437
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
-1914964838
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
-394876864
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
-1670253145
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
1397247112
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
833601866
then."
-1046829518

-1840324437
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
1378218968
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
-1943632673

-1840324437
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
-107105526
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
1212067394
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
-804232434
duplicity.
490227068

-1840324437
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
-980190029
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
-455439680
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
449151962
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.
1641946003

-1840324437
CHAPTER III
987611945

-1840324437

-1840324437
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
-429234302
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
2057741789
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
-1624721022
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
-2117417973
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
117243379
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
-1446628621
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
1900054907
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
-1959017077
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
833198389

-1840324437
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
1884748611
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
-563704127
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
-981273718
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
-624052190
pillow, leaning over me.
-58139771

-1840324437
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
-36883135
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
-1763254349
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
-2004070537
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
745873362
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
1355903049
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
-19015143
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
-1938131955
herself and the children she employed a physician.
922246403

-1840324437
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
-201482124

-1840324437
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
-1194833827
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
-1563231446
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
8718798
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
490345064
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
1462017412
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
-191141203
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
273650602
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
-379109732

-1840324437
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
-1737199398

-1840324437
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
455749907
rough.  "I will try."
2067932950

-1840324437
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
-1875393614

-1840324437
"No, thank you, Bessie."
-1022569507

-1840324437
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
-2138907787
may call me if you want anything in the night."
917275600

-1840324437
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
-863163282

-1840324437
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
-477924863

-1840324437
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
-1639796907
soon, no doubt."
669998117

-1840324437
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
-1280040758
say--
1989763269

-1840324437
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
602729790
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
1416171974
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
-1661904897
rather too hard."
2948048

-1840324437
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
-1337768438
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
803447331
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
-757666528
the main subject discussed.
340942340

-1840324437
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
1936550435
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
-1265532251
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
-2050868808

-1840324437
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
1633043261
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
-820850122
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
1003138201

-1840324437
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
-390168655
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
-811210060
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
853924102
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
795084932
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
2019151649
bad propensities.
-1626997600

-1840324437
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
2049065608
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
1471167143
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
2031823893
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
-829376497
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
-102239114
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
-966037754
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
532817309
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
-357734114
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
810068511
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
-720197056
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
417892773
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
897305441
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
-919570479

-1840324437
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
1977263513
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
-806355254
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
-847330686
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
1779704534
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
-645541132
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
-1771580893
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
-1192600847
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
-1687261628
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
-860669771
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
-1040086415
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
-543975673
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
1574361648
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
-344337407
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
744041668
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
-1452082326
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
-904646673
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
-1525371741
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
474772507
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
75028163
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
1704235459
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
552017055
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
-833954004
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
-931435584
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
849960105
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
2079563880
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
1286908159
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
-928038074
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
-143158764
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
-79688779
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
652237763
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
488487438
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
578612732
untasted tart.
-1809738538

-1840324437
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
1828020653
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
-1270959198
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
-980445702
Meantime she sang: her song was--
1909595391

-1840324437
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
-1667260540
      A long time ago."
1180808344

-1840324437
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
-69941465
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
-542632528
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
872695308
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
-1621012975
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
630472483
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
-352554917
one.
-1415010157

-1840324437
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
1063327409
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
1229517241
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
620395446
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
481243050

-1840324437
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
-1757131048
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
-739816239
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
1738130495
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
108146817

-1840324437
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
-577994389
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
-2033962192
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
-1126575704
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
-1078164520

-1840324437
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
1526302770
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
891857836
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
-723185490
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
-1230093436

-1840324437
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
-1709072645
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
870771450
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
1548574571
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
-1015734896

-1840324437
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
-2079002035
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
-1332593797
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
53243150
Lloyd came again.
1875251273

-1840324437
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
-179501398
how is she?"
634052786

-1840324437
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
-1600386405

-1840324437
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
122343127
is Jane, is it not?"
-673370721

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
-1504850072

-1840324437
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
-224926108
Have you any pain?"
-921622505

-1840324437
"No, sir."
-1824508055

-1840324437
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
1707491769
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
-978412192

-1840324437
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
1128215631

-1840324437
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
838109098
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
1395957741
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
-798827079

-1840324437
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
-1385726379

-1840324437
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
623670684
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
-632432926
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
1826901981
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
-1456118658
leisure, he said--
1524042175

-1840324437
"What made you ill yesterday?"
-441407797

-1840324437
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
-106037798

-1840324437
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
582774701
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
-1587830216

-1840324437
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
563462661
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
1338603621
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
-767957190

-1840324437
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
542213661
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
-957368221
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
228680069

-1840324437
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
-913597354
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
-222971052

-1840324437
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
1210218301
Bessie was gone.
889795017

-1840324437
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
496881420

-1840324437
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
-787607921

-1840324437
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
-1688640587

-1840324437
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
1624692716
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
-2130674067
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
769685396
that I think I shall never forget it."
835738987

-1840324437
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
-207501146
daylight?"
-987455949

-1840324437
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
-1054545491
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
-439373559

-1840324437
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
1882563139

-1840324437
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
-1699255605
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
-1446042157
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
1576921492
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
-692432162
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
638247711
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
469411979
though, as far as it went, true response.
934607536

-1840324437
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
-568907248

-1840324437
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
417745492

-1840324437
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
-1913694823

-1840324437
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
-327593658

-1840324437
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
-737154621

-1840324437
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
-144653926
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
-189584296

-1840324437
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
333571175
than a servant."
1842796278

-1840324437
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
-457960064

-1840324437
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
1463206665
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
2144737843

-1840324437
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
-2017675619

-1840324437
"I think not, sir."
2140968793

-1840324437
"None belonging to your father?"
2142929908

-1840324437
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
-530596799
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
-367769668
them."
775584318

-1840324437
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
-1696861037

-1840324437
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
-807673913
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
-114662338
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
1464570836
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
-1911842323
for me was synonymous with degradation.
-1735909934

-1840324437
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
1263501654

-1840324437
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
-1747029891

-1840324437
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
1454830250
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
-1420900473
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
-1785224571
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
-1865143854
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
337210160
the price of caste.
-900219825

-1840324437
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
-682217679

-1840324437
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
-1271396662
set: I should not like to go a begging."
2092603350

-1840324437
"Would you like to go to school?"
-1999457925

-1840324437
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
733436043
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
1831921044
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
-183826439
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
-579853278
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
1803661361
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
-731901702
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
-402849253
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
-2071324276
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
338614293
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
-1283997955
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
-1711838254
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
-2053077639
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
1276394989
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
-1277919336

-1840324437
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
807153256
musings.
-806884491

-1840324437
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
703833278
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
-596292543
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
-107143399

-1840324437
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
-358543341
the gravel-walk.
-1924871886

-1840324437
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
1719996482
to her before I go."
-296078644

-1840324437
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
-1959858361
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
-1754142617
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
-1231320363
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
-143155662
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
815615820
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
-19181887
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
-1373789641
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
-832788604
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
1198906598
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
-416307828

-1840324437
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
-1195614562
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
-631640433
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
-1764386177
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
517837548
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
1493020442
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
1457948110
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
532427221
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
1326661898
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
-501205148
of each other.
-773421993

-1840324437
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
1810232835
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
-1277278540

-1840324437
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
-210084874
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
1930713139
little toad as that."
-241636392

-1840324437
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
38169160
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
-410082412

-1840324437
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
-1504973496
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
-137781915
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
-711053808
rabbit for supper."
294755706

-1840324437
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
1757805990

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER IV
1076453036

-1840324437

-1840324437
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
-1856040641
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
907974391
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
1521436681
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
1014676411
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
1562099329
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
-1835683747
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
-1689243851
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
-1534395341
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
-747335566
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
2044151128
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
-1649213270
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
2043564456
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
865127777
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
807875026
and rooted aversion.
-720831295

-1840324437
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
759654543
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
-1300047045
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
-656780359
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
516019799
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
-782911247
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
379807287
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
-57593162
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
308445459
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
-1946886807
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
-1694556039
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
-702808088
was stopped rather harshly--
1029318434

-1840324437
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
-2029945480
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
-538492107
should associate with her."
-1416736982

-1840324437
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
499949185
deliberating on my words--
-1645940881

-1840324437
"They are not fit to associate with me."
528694192

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
-49070470
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
1498839319
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
1029998513
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
-1223179678
syllable during the remainder of the day.
-624577324

-1840324437
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
-1548541115
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
-2013820884
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
-1577041359
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
-569102761

-1840324437
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
-203043310
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
663918613
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
148881535
fiend.  I was now in for it.
-919637957

-1840324437
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
612878470
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
1152055659
wish me dead."
-2052721848

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
-1148154833
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
-1532113222
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
98056440
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
-1539563814
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
488601299
in my breast.
391813992

-1840324437
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
1280432724
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
390393
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
-152710150
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
1271838619
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
-1363502298
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
-733106656
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
1222858391
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
1161493105
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
-1226403593
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
-2040695421
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
30002510
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
650541938
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
128027568
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
1404459643
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
1359091120
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
296104773
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
-252340392
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
-326206195
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
732521352
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
-1050371251
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
443200332
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
-1154447589
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
684048904
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
-1600261657
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
966433431
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
1053214510
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
1269920572
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
464680166
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
1007157169
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
1140762603
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
-1079763638
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
1945601062
to be happy likewise.
1847684247

-1840324437
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
746566385
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
-262324032
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
290777104
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
145276590
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
883423085
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
267051167
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
-246086503
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
-1377959350
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
226681370
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
2118481921
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
-451102124
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
-284339295
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
-1616033065
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
-2596868
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
-567366852
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
1589697582
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
982435380
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
17749307
Gateshead Hall.
1928239202

-1840324437
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
-699073253
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
2024281789
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
-287334920
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
2029513517
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
387210567
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
1666711381
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
294603618
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
1427233307
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
-1082749732
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
857911646
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
1002714813
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
648578475
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
-210603879
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
863916723
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
-444001627
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
-2097194038
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
655679045
accuracy.
1535721800

-1840324437
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
1565168553
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
736579016
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
-2012305957
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
1473690321
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
1544631275
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
-1388946553
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
1572764684
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
-353570846
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
760786248
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
-1967361779
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
685345331
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
514935236
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
-549898685
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
1943869769
frost.
-1102222247

-1840324437
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
-58324879
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
1789490915
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
1000110380
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
1580828895
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
1237522090
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
470680352
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
1207344550
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
-243738882
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
203421712
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
-1382133095
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
905528989
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
-613668932
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
-1458434995
nursery.
492181838

-1840324437
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
-1114169680
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
-195034504
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
985221795
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
-605377973
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
-102848078

-1840324437
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
588233262

-1840324437
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
1090153563
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
-1691432938
window for?"
381268533

-1840324437
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
2127060716
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
1282181978
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
1932377669
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
-1999229616
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
879504030
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
868827632

-1840324437
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
1545551954
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
-21331516
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
583558709
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
1890993850
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
1496844397
which it dismayed me to intrude.
914115887

-1840324437
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
-2045656221
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
-1410648050
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
-1088310629
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
511735543
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
-159484467
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
1355498210

-1840324437
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
657167536
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
2128098476
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
807026800
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
-1099433914
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
2007784490
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
1697342494
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
578241947
by way of capital.
1394873309

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
2035437869
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
1277310611
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
599441655
you."
-1924209165

-1840324437
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
537968041
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
1442237176
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
1224414729
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
93810464

-1840324437
"Ten years."
1111100864

-1840324437
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
890099695
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
365882582

-1840324437
"Jane Eyre, sir."
1956028017

-1840324437
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
-1611733534
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
-1025504891
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
-1186006144

-1840324437
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
-1659443227

-1840324437
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
905577568
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
778014329
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
211780439
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
378522417

-1840324437
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
-880856008
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
-424194861
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
208799638

-1840324437
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
917143709
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
1596504200
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
1636383027

-1840324437
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
-1100438555
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
589602887

-1840324437
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
-641899654

-1840324437
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
-1193380528

-1840324437
"A pit full of fire."
-812851885

-1840324437
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
1794418078
ever?"
-250374935

-1840324437
"No, sir."
-1824508055

-1840324437
"What must you do to avoid it?"
198424913

-1840324437
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
1313852569
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
-2051636013

-1840324437
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
1204539590
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
1420188955
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
1394219064
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
1510214817

-1840324437
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
1382462157
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
-1921576809
enough away.
-1255915263

-1840324437
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
398016681
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
-685178849

-1840324437
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
1224158003
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
1562796341

-1840324437
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
-259270399

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Do you read your Bible?"
332649393

-1840324437
"Sometimes."
1678931531

-1840324437
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
-968678235

-1840324437
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
-1180330113
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
-190202896
and Jonah."
1797406693

-1840324437
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
816535258

-1840324437
"No, sir."
-1824508055

-1840324437
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
-541148927
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
-1900977849
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
1587874464
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
-696041582
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
191316988
piety."
1272018227

-1840324437
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
-922540050

-1840324437
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
-334180628
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
-2063207832
give you a heart of flesh."
-269413796

-1840324437
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
-1441382197
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
1187556504
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
-1017643192
conversation herself.
-1827744975

-1840324437
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
801749252
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
-1358067940
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
-2003035978
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
-972129774
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
409077672
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
2079864287
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
925106273

-1840324437
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
1136218868
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
102426000
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
968341152
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
-736546393
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
2029098727
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
1898663053
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
-629203807
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
1956145678
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
-1397388966
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
-1441763045

-1840324437
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
1860682851
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
1411943735

-1840324437
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
-1475905631
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
-326152885
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
-1562631884
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
871681157

-1840324437
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
-225338947
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
1813731289
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
385869519
Lowood."
950483814

-1840324437
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
-2118492834
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
-35872479
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
774355095
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
1784867491
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
-2129752010
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
1691803007
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
1895585957
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
2034430554
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
-831017656
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
1987864037
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
-395814401
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
-1815071951

-1840324437
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
701475649
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
-1493897703
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
-678454642
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
1688946189

-1840324437
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
1576191043
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
-155271510
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
-1998730549
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
971759260
inhabitants."
1191028830

-1840324437
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
1382433350
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
335799467
and prospects?"
1409733446

-1840324437
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
-1283257569
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
-1360139042
of her election."
210495601

-1840324437
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
328087156
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
-2121383656
becoming too irksome."
1853137834

-1840324437
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
-659596779
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
810036078
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
-107450648
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
1702134596
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
1057757732

-1840324437
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
1012585481
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
-842456282

-1840324437
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
855550647
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
-1327688297
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
454870355
falsehood and deceit.'"
1074490412

-1840324437
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
-367021308
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
-1173760256

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
200055377
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
494923507
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
-1344581398
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
23091937
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
1264696547
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
-102397112
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
-1476410948
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
884843711
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
-2122760065
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
1177508311
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
1541396019
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
722585216
handsome attire.
-248186402

-1840324437
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
-150492231
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
1459789929
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
-783129911
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
-1308749528
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
-1814037905
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
1045415403
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
-735875902
fomented now within me.
44742610

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
-2144161060
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
1485674655

-1840324437
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
-329325649
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
-1042133761
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
-1576729617
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
-914784173
to her.
-1021977003

-1840324437
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
-84174111
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
-353581455
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
1985880663

-1840324437
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
2075260253
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
1629289217
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
1354514903
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
-1428277170

-1840324437
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
-653171452
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
1978583645

-1840324437
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
-1790593014
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
-676910941
used to a child.
-1563278415

-1840324437
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
-1551249105
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
389457034

-1840324437
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
1635789343
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
1323068505
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
-1358319094
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
761715453
miserable cruelty."
1843923963

-1840324437
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
1800533370

-1840324437
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
542215412
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
-982843091
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
819397239
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
1041712950
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
2089580581
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
67149642
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
1480561990
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
-615252692
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
1104908464
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
809752227

-1840324437
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
1154836013

-1840324437
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
-631052552
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
-1126973050
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
1417897826
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
-1869723215
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
-760317891
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
-279309093
would cry.
591131958

-1840324437
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
-1601611785
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
-904738969

-1840324437
"No, Mrs. Reed."
1539119525

-1840324437
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
2125319172
your friend."
3957135

-1840324437
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
-1672573398
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
-1363350503
you have done."
627204964

-1840324437
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
-32529554
their faults."
-1285705316

-1840324437
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
-872140608

-1840324437
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
-892682579
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
379430798

-1840324437
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
1931576218
Reed, for I hate to live here."
1570026522

-1840324437
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
-1133445680
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
1671298719

-1840324437
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
-127103289
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
-343168368
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
501911952
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
-1435183363
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
831665840
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
-295776318
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
-347610671
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
958161891
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
265388702
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
1990635323
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
-1759180922
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
-120499339
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
-1263671463
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
3253706

-1840324437
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
959652887
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
-672805783
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
-552777962
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
-388867470
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
1130968972
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
-1810222631
of my nature.
860942296

-1840324437
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
-1131895018
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
530754692
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
129226476
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
-2021404744
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
468799898
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
-38069316
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
-2100512901
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
10153042
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
-1836847117
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
2128539682
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
-875889615
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
-350559027
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
-1906006893
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
1306298722
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
-1079549581
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
-43585442
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
-1830699436
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
-457121972

-1840324437
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
-1664802042
to lunch!"
-1393571201

-1840324437
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
-1075026325
came tripping down the path.
1573592570

-1840324437
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
1983486405
called?"
1217118722

-1840324437
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
1249515764
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
-1773833183
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
-371302796
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
-1747224858
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
682448231
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
-249754202

-1840324437
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
-1526580136
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
-283805932

-1840324437
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
-1898814650
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
2040275928
suppose?"
-1084295290

-1840324437
I nodded.
1018670272

-1840324437
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
-1958742761

-1840324437
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
-1537997751

-1840324437
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
507046242
be bolder."
1204605888

-1840324437
"What! to get more knocks?"
1540019114

-1840324437
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
-1822853765
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
479875587
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
266347601
for you."
1432986497

-1840324437
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
-764746124

-1840324437
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
-1869623262
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
-2049351806
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
-1560472364
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
-1147720116
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
-1411895024
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
629161575

-1840324437
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
372889395

-1840324437
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
2018827481
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
1066028007
provoking."
529869214

-1840324437
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
-452792278
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
835403513
dread."
-2073299301

-1840324437
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
-784378164

-1840324437
"As you do, Bessie?"
-547408142

-1840324437
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
1305072530
others."
812667956

-1840324437
"You don't show it."
1279130634

-1840324437
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
-181116582
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
-2082380904

-1840324437
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
2142351135
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
391010816
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
-862408550

-1840324437
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
677424469

-1840324437
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
1227976450

-1840324437
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
394928280
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
-1561095389
you'd _rather_ not."
-712727603

-1840324437
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
-14374351
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
-950113678
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
-937485923
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
685213652
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
-1746796296

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER V
1076217031

-1840324437

-1840324437
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
-1256998831
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
475283878
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
392092347
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
-1946470297
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
-448416110
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
1286811210
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
533278876
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
-1597415959
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
773352255
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
-299656269
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
-470810283
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
730017626
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
-1448967996
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
1322670954
bye?"
-744244724

-1840324437
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
-1901349160
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
1648739103
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
-392988639
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
-951624815

-1840324437
"What did you say, Miss?"
1141297543

-1840324437
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
315338088
the wall."
-1491652734

-1840324437
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
640681239

-1840324437
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
-1569522563
been my foe."
-1206370031

-1840324437
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
-1291502002

-1840324437
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
-201514829
out at the front door.
1781990548

-1840324437
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
-1926435334
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
641726605
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
-1076097574
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
1755300251
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
-957534299
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
-2024864607
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
441799491
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
1736912359
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
1142359619

-1840324437
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
-536405241

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"And how far is it?"
-414459940

-1840324437
"Fifty miles."
940872904

-1840324437
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
1378337381
alone."
1657495620

-1840324437
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
-1309654732
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
1551930219
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
242669316
with kisses.
-525773630

-1840324437
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
1848704691
me into the inside.
-78346557

-1840324437
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
-1690322817
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
1116451215
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
1515564992
mysterious regions.
806122077

-1840324437
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
772303738
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
1339128008
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
-1147870920
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
-647580320
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
-1620693091
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
-1789240666
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
-1278559986
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
1882124314
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
1907381888
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
233497684
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
-679851014
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
-910968996
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
-1938399012
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
-1201732104
"stony street" of L-.
-330355526

-1840324437
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
895616173
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
1603008009
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
1476316186
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
-379611999
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
1354303503
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
-1950264949

-1840324437
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
-2012177947
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
-1857873669
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
627229531
by the light of the lamps.
1467899851

-1840324437
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
635379549
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
179889710
instantly drove away.
-267026719

-1840324437
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
-1985214189
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
681380090
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
-1177497325
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
-1475540371
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
-2129882026
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
1016608092
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
1059830981
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
1604072388
with a fire, where she left me alone.
2000926654

-1840324437
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
-1711061766
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
-1475225181
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
247899101
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
1929517533
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
1782698619
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
337816441
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
67235192

-1840324437
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
-715047325
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
2041046701
grave, her bearing erect.
1672027048

-1840324437
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
-613447038
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
868025657
then further added--
-776966070

-1840324437
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
-1108138393
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
1897301109

-1840324437
"A little, ma'am."
1736512674

-1840324437
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
1672579376
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
-951206445
come to school, my little girl?"
188726189

-1840324437
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
-2004531082
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
79698788
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
1176779252
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
1922131479
me along with Miss Miller.
757835141

-1840324437
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
1203146026
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
-1775283998
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
236357317
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
-329664265
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
-2044302567
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
-143522617
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
1691586652
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
-2073906307
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
1716550174
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
-673085080
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
-1471035178
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
-486659460
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
2012804725
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
-283254681
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
-1449864480
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
481477394
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
665273387
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
1369811425

-1840324437
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
129909370
to the top of the long room she cried out--
1542931557

-1840324437
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
-1425626796

-1840324437
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
420096913
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
419259408

-1840324437
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
1037335895

-1840324437
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
1864914938
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
568951786
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
-1715400622
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
671962535
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
-832295495
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
1669287284
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
-1211015396

-1840324437
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
-125640277
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
1596430584
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
493058893
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
905502278
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
-1723582288
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
-1119352687
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
647371869
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
420748512

-1840324437
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
434403262
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
1782326176
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
475054780
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
452662492
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
1723091867
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
1548334214
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
1267562416
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
-1258936907
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
215632932
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
1269160164
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
893119933
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
-876989

-1840324437
"Form classes!"
294869221

-1840324437
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
1223995889
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
-964477716
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
1860331170
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
1270814866
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
1604191688
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
-1269553197
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
-2086035206

-1840324437
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
-424193797
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
-1734893227
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
-1703348305
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
-441342636
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
865041319

-1840324437
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
1356279081
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
-1618958246
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
-2096085809
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
1261644900
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
-205610736
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
2015621201
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
-1541364107
little the day before.
-1855376237

-1840324437
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
1110718872
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
611538959
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
1651931137
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
1033589129
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
17311997
the first class, rose the whispered words--
1415915714

-1840324437
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
-497710284

-1840324437
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
252341812
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
1767861598
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
-1941356702
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
382112641
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
-202828760
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
-123399506
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
-552903999
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
-45418879
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
2141310881
the meal began.
-39613524

-1840324437
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
661063581
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
254959758
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
652357568
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
1480054642
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
-1359439271
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
7591904
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
1319475665
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
-671695796
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
1704897423
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
1105588105
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
-380034936
them, the stout one, whispered--
2002820559

-1840324437
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
-184793603

-1840324437
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
1040735003
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
1928561073
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
-591794853
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
-243531728
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
-1198195331
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
-359237688
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
78447295
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
-793450179
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
-1461177777
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
-1589562318

-1840324437
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
-1975754457
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
27374969

-1840324437
"Silence!  To your seats!"
-1444170144

-1840324437
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
675850791
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
440906001
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
-1656463012
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
410408913
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
-1926507771
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
1567369290
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
-257478354
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
-575180453
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
-116064445
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
-2018348878
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
-1058960329
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
586237239
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
667086284

-1840324437
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
-1875352780
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
1994074779
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
-337392893
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
-13659826
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
-1714418451
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
-343166185

-1840324437
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
1769296222
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
-409295711
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
300561639
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
-1369636824
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
1662056241
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
603599294
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
-414363609
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
529540904

-1840324437
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
-1496280892

-1840324437
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
287614205
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
331859811
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
-596159233
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
1819483602
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
-516538351
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
2017533511
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
647982164
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
940228289
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
1687101489
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
1384160675
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
-631075678
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
1979171965
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
-692240097
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
1662141707
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
1619796059
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
-1374396484

-1840324437
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
1654541202
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
-131548856
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
893193662
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
1554171628
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
576840759
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
-1643714847
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
-607960567
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
-293778644

-1840324437
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
-210937037

-1840324437
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
224684127
sank at her voice.  She went on--
1307424517

-1840324437
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
1621822726
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
-1733663891
to all."
-1842880818

-1840324437
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
1632017245

-1840324437
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
715790546
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
-267430613

-1840324437
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
-590790413
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
-1000127473
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
1311344825
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
1569350795
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
946105575

-1840324437
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
-1837679064
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
-1047516333
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
986716701
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
1521306670
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
-1968145878
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
-1582107655
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
599755443
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
-245740107
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
-14964819
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
1210969016
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
-1255601823
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
1285996120
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
-922168331
hollow cough.
574157435

-1840324437
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
-560846365
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
777662603
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
1337659572
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
1156503
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
-289429893
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
-1991998984
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
-276350100
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
-2010510872
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
27370160
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
-285912286
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
-38030500
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
1313621512
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
-1105420758
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
1653731537
this inscription:--
147313261

-1840324437
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
-1771679028
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
-1528179937
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
573581741
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
-2090771661

-1840324437
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
-150126941
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
-1766537099
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
1393437813
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
1133173332
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
517024729
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
-330360683
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
-1134537288
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
1042384009
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
1563932634
I said to her directly--
-673894456

-1840324437
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
-657729698
her to lend it to me some day.
2049357913

-1840324437
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
-1625840355
she examined me.
1365700170

-1840324437
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
-710899484
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
191018184
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
757799915
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
-11122541
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
392053699
or substantial.
1045848155

-1840324437
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
1582276047

-1840324437
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
91529055
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
-1462756219
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
-618008687
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
-2145832108
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
-1084705049
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
-483672725

-1840324437
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
-1322138163
is Lowood Institution?"
-1877343569

-1840324437
"This house where you are come to live."
-861841950

-1840324437
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
-516742099
other schools?"
-891731232

-1840324437
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
-1319698045
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
1568936792
father or your mother dead?"
1630763983

-1840324437
"Both died before I can remember."
-1939319596

-1840324437
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
-1450910818
is called an institution for educating orphans."
350684042

-1840324437
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
1294940087

-1840324437
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
-1112649745

-1840324437
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
-1596940103

-1840324437
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
-1340720345
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
-1890912614

-1840324437
"Who subscribes?"
-1112843222

-1840324437
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
-165415251
and in London."
1280568379

-1840324437
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
997017373

-1840324437
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
1116029921
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
-1142205947

-1840324437
"Why?"
500216564

-1840324437
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
1519758281

-1840324437
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
583274937
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
-1267965825

-1840324437
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
-1755213184
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
-789977874
all our clothes."
36841384

-1840324437
"Does he live here?"
334167504

-1840324437
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
-2112955979

-1840324437
"Is he a good man?"
-1580777296

-1840324437
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
-1236992837

-1840324437
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
-522465441

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"And what are the other teachers called?"
772300552

-1840324437
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
-517964505
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
1638467768
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
1378197490
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
-2142013862
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
1725252747
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
-1503830574
teaches French."
1543551285

-1840324437
"Do you like the teachers?"
1740842109

-1840324437
"Well enough."
1633171656

-1840324437
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
239970746
pronounce her name as you do."
1273138493

-1840324437
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
567436886
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
-24676457

-1840324437
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
481121607

-1840324437
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
1843843539
she knows far more than they do."
1988308016

-1840324437
"Have you been long here?"
1171805446

-1840324437
"Two years."
-306876320

-1840324437
"Are you an orphan?"
1638302873

-1840324437
"My mother is dead."
-1967482242

-1840324437
"Are you happy here?"
-1735864243

-1840324437
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
-1060527867
the present: now I want to read."
-1197862963

-1840324437
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
-325358376
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
-654401273
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
473175615
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
326598313
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
-896982572
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
-1367317570
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
14018723
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
377189274
day's fare would be like this.
-275206961

-1840324437
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
541450660
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
-1885974394

-1840324437
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
-802590448
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
740631897
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
1372041301
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
986331122
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
528851087
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
1460072859
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
-1165339031
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
-1242858682
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
-1328012282
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
1754927482
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
-1359323810
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
-1618268800
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
-1603792496
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
401612882
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
1617560721
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
-180094900

-1840324437
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
-312833048
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
-913146885
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
-1046435125
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
145404331
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
117865954
first day at Lowood.

CHAPTER VI
1111647779

-1840324437

-1840324437
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
-1960719341
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
-1072456181
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
1527543059
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
833276754
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
1333751101
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
1026538251

-1840324437
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
-2135042196
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
-1318830717
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
9280667
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
633885872

-1840324437
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
1176807240
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
1813405298
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
-165014844
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
-170052372
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
-1836694730
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
-1259097660
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
-1757813757
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
-2130625826
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
1640140641
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
1577787860
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
-87907536
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
-458963963
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
961191732
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
-1029873845
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
-1555758670
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
-981653998
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
175277889
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
1677163044
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
-796054443
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
1492711276

-1840324437
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
1492556812
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
-124547681
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
-557290531
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
-433055458
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
297207755
&c. &c.
-1268006387

-1840324437
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
883418538
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
483809118
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
625747300
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
-1549434949
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
-1041047262
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
507367187
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
1194750007
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
1250155476

-1840324437
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
-30543158
morning!"
-1008006467

-1840324437
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
709027220
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
1663826252
as the water was frozen?"
-76966315

-1840324437
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
1714771315
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
-24577052
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
-1702782392
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
-1798674482
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
-1280079815
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
-134545079
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
1751115910
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
1916778564
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
-336333451
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
-173919098
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
-54037068
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
-1426654620
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
-200492552
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
1559864900
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
1276382746
altered its ordinary expression.
-900889081

-1840324437
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
1619523592
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
-786642293

-1840324437
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
-1118113484
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
-685766524
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
-1759490360

-1840324437
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
-1050728198
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
-2101748945
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
1150897706
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
2128736823
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
-74663810
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
819118907
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
-2102414336
one a welcome sense of liberty.
-1208200207

-1840324437
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
992957930
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
1254378695
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
-811266277
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
780667580
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
-471020143
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
-1709622175
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
341158670

-1840324437
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
790365855
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
508980090
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
1958026674
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
926585993
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
994656951
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
2059167836
to clamour.
251949471

-1840324437
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
1275156077
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
-1438991069
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
-1686209823
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
-1574392048

-1840324437
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
1418596248

-1840324437
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
1552663725

-1840324437
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
1685316859
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
426430113
floor.
1005577615

-1840324437
"What is your name besides Burns?"
2426749

-1840324437
"Helen."
-1503255546

-1840324437
"Do you come a long way from here?"
2040970475

-1840324437
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
-601776151

-1840324437
"Will you ever go back?"
1472082037

-1840324437
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
-1140464219

-1840324437
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
51726197

-1840324437
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
995402102
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
1706817154

-1840324437
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
808802753

-1840324437
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
433492615

-1840324437
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
-1771644092
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
198882325
break it under her nose."
310414150

-1840324437
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
407210202
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
1880160325
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
-1160140013
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
-717589347
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
1582462733
Bible bids us return good for evil."
-252204857

-1840324437
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
-223908988
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
-890692269
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
-157597796

-1840324437
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
-1024849113
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
936854577
required to bear."
-1034837729

-1840324437
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
1777107849
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
1555211116
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
1578838193
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
485536308
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
567438829
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
-2045860876

-1840324437
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
2095956567
good."
2078055702

-1840324437
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
813670058
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
1614858979
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
-1032649221
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
92482190
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
2099551112
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
-1151200004

-1840324437
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
93551434
addition: she kept silence.
1815294009

-1840324437
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
1187645989

-1840324437
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
-744904903
grave face.
-110571546

-1840324437
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
738725370
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
646809432
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
1763188065
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
2012621556
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
1032671070
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
-168721790
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
-778702224

-1840324437
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
-1465406644

-1840324437
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
-1787244841
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
860621101
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
-759795579
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
-2145968506
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
272162917
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
1866553451
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
993569584
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
427407593
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
-5327623
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
1961148160
answer ready."
-1520411126

-1840324437
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
739523664

-1840324437
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
-18177584
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
1189455997
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
-605230964
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
1667101463
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
1232984923
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
39798126
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
-1398684420
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
-532383442
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
171847385
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
-777627128

-1840324437
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
-1555656103
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
60975863
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
276348881

-1840324437
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
2060019176

-1840324437
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
-1699382853
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
-2146720594
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
4703063
I wished to gain."
-183984567

-1840324437
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
305534802

-1840324437
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
-800306794
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
-1381790809

-1840324437
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
1689983612
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
62659132
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
701306614
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
-1466133464
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
-1343835125
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
-42252299
person who struck us never to do it again."
804833869

-1840324437
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
-1268552891
but a little untaught girl."
-972339399

-1840324437
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
112342038
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
-187297613
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
1886726840
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
-131272169

-1840324437
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
-1771734765
civilised nations disown it."
833314288

-1840324437
"How?  I don't understand."
-1246449579

-1840324437
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
-1641534931
certainly heals injury."
1673967044

-1840324437
"What then?"
1854241678

-1840324437
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
1758662047
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
-1026533073

-1840324437
"What does He say?"
1222661896

-1840324437
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
-973010894
you and despitefully use you."
1920143481

-1840324437
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
-1202549007
John, which is impossible."
2065867773

-1840324437
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
-2035047276
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
-368881099
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
453654355
softening.
1937975549

-1840324437
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
-1698523074
remark, but she said nothing.
-1664512173

-1840324437
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
-1446655415
woman?"
-921504523

-1840324437
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
-654800602
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
586145356
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
975577528
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
630266040
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
-1354671894
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
-806205846
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
-1825576677
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
446014614
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
1943018792
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
-142239935
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
471394872
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
45460669
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
-2095971653
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
-1672986334
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
-1017739487
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
-1808910966
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
-723642104
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
-1187522945
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
-1087696483
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
68111610
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
62371150
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
-2069519609
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
-951615332
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
942517441
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
1493360747

-1840324437
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
1311040175
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
-1308952287
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
-75865156
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
643080229
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
-664154207

-1840324437
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
-628751305
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
1020580043

-1840324437
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
2123246234
without reply as without delay.

CHAPTER VII
-2047012018

-1840324437

-1840324437
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
1817829558
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
-1128999920
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
1390266698
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
-2016071183
were no trifles.
-1636384037

-1840324437
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
-836811505
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
1690374832
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
-1261303390
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
431869441
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
-1916923709
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
-616181708
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
-1905745736
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
302824087
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
1462885940
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
-1886138685
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
-1108782805
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
-474578090
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
387362959
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
170960420
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
-310158207
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
554453067
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
887784037
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
-584666277
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
1636045900

-1840324437
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
-2022181963
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
-1290844628
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
2120702783
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
-167728515
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
1718609646
meals, was served round between the services.
-932118869

-1840324437
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
594816960
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
-369106257
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
167564319

-1840324437
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
-967140500
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
1006642539
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
527581369
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
-1793098238
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
617774679
to attempt the task of cheering others.
-1532869625

-1840324437
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
171894204
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
-617858876
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
213383944
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
-330846669
starved arms in their pinafores.
1998378205

-1840324437
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
-1211859671
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
-1661379358
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
687159456
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
-676000048
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
244349188
invariably obliged to part with.
1083162667

-1840324437
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
717814358
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
231945046
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
-1624514934
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
-1808560215
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
-529035400
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
691738820
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
290048205
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
2123370918
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
1277537177
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
-1710454961
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
-1918429225

-1840324437
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
-194941813
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
1641037753
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
390263935
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
-1544672659
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
1974042871

-1840324437
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
-1277269069
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
-1286974220
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
-1924143583
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
-1565407999
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
-1868355888
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
889445498
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
-1837043761
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
-835038948
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
1567841403
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
-1320792110
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
1479728204
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
-432600786

-1840324437
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
1426863097
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
-1360330582
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
-101827130
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
642485991
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
1728480180
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
-1717537953
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
-418295537

-1840324437
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
422810911
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
-1642406250
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
1096516747
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
-648025730
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
21806217
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
-1366670721

-1840324437
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
106875300
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
-1127359491
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
143010431
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
1892236965
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
-1368360725
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
1936351353
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
-1622411296
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
-53332061
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
-1132945090
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
2119413638
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
1976707600

-1840324437
He paused.
-2039196414

-1840324437
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
-1915724805

-1840324437
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
-531378266
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
2012111602
to one."
253129807

-1840324437
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
544800932
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
-744979395
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
874520875
occasion."
-2107669320

-1840324437
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
-1548043200

-1840324437
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
180283964
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
2016201799
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
-504599357
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
-1317474594
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
-1088733655
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
1178709907
what authority?"
-1610934307

-1840324437
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
-1166898275
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
-861855109
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
-851031926

-1840324437
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
98315560
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
186470488
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
-978413872
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
-202731539
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
-301884939
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
-610459135
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
-476246307
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
203891511
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
1338375589
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
-239914592
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
-1884444815
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
-553894427
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
-207063000
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
290402476
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
1672807327
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
-1291754219
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
533638124
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
1993624113
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
951617379

-1840324437
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
1817671025
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
559427282
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
-46442647
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
-1992808297
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
-197432801
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
1369633231
severity.
-1823298057

-1840324437
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
-984204116
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
123371682
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
-1549743114
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
-1227904744

-1840324437
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
35256725
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
1179377945
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
1937705678

-1840324437
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
389006351

-1840324437
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
-1382290485
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
-348462446
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
-1274667965
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
-1491101785

-1840324437
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
-775287846

-1840324437
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
-1395885773
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
-1517469820
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
-83869057
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
-977438856
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
1158521647
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
-900930421
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
212853443

-1840324437
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
562469112
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
1250188415
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
-1942242428
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
-487796938
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
-1567966385
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
55441563
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
662470979
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
-1705200211

-1840324437
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
912555139
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
694450391

-1840324437
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
-1608770671

-1840324437
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
1882027526

-1840324437
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
1319074188
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
-1122592934
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
-1837466053
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
2015452086
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
-805515255
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
-639954600
time wasted, of--"
-1367175481

-1840324437
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
-528149897
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
-2012270668
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
1672627502
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
187723124
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
-926541722
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
-1727427264
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
-1283856189
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
941023852
false front of French curls.
-1142900159

-1840324437
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
-1943392698
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
111500655
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
-141238194
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
1728583572
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
1485221493
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
1299214520
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
872652084
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
1888738304
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
-535960786
my attention.
1272559339

-1840324437
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
1796174494
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
423605950
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
-446030806
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
-736622045
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
817504545
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
1000676139
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
-552532312
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
-1545099022
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
-1473268450
my forces for the worst.  It came.
892243678

-1840324437
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
954071076
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
-1867655585
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
816962388
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
-1812045112

-1840324437
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
-434089357
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
-147916645
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
-1832071540
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
-1584278469

-1840324437
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
-1696780775
punished."
1729234289

-1840324437
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
1683295553

-1840324437
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
1401971915
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
661841594
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
1875864487

-1840324437
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
-1162722189
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
-68723460

-1840324437
"Place the child upon it."
-452307436

-1840324437
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
1696694033
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
-1827735467
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
1598460125
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
721215254
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
1455779890

-1840324437
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
-455664229

-1840324437
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
-1009837292
children, you all see this girl?"
1548734372

-1840324437
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
-1336603772
against my scorched skin.
411403555

-1840324437
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
1044324296
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
50470326
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
1778027922
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
517759757
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
524183661

-1840324437
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
-336538989
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
-615483636
must be firmly sustained.
-1038414266

-1840324437
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
-1445785009
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
1225552899
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
857546045
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
895841532
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
781803223
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
-1629537230
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
-745366237
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
1189806912
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
1112868941
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
-229258103
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
533122377
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
796008086

-1840324437
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
-440910116
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
1087880922
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
480160167
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
-649834170
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
-1263859037

-1840324437
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
-530337347
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
1621921234
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
877098317
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
550239885
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
-1735175337
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
-586278691
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
-19757782
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
-345688041
waters to stagnate round her."
1951839522

-1840324437
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
-1340584505
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
-1850939732
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
-1805186859
Turning at the door, my judge said--
1029613700

-1840324437
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
-1266472589
her during the remainder of the day."
1213140843

-1840324437
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
-372767087
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
-412213734
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
-172424456
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
-548940751
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
328529945
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
-1958649899
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
-901123097
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
-1128050945
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
1889300317
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
-1639426625
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
179236374
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
-1596452014
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
25054506
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
-605126868
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
-1035169432
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
936475180
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
-814380434
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
-1429710417
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
525314546
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
-594902029
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
294418278
the full brightness of the orb.
816969411

-1840324437
CHAPTER VIII
1882798932

-1840324437

-1840324437
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
398657528
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
121746664
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
-1025256749
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
-2017981605
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
1073084091
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
380390
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
-1147764241
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
-416530674
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
476936561
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
-1558961156
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
-1503146309
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
-1748235409
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
358559903
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
-514621869
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
-63705866
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
-1586743019

-1840324437
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
-1326816638
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
548476769
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
704332823
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
400578756

-1840324437
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
1957741445
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
2134128018
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
-2030348122
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
802241954
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
2004882007
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
-1608628859
first who spoke--
-254059248

-1840324437
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
-59880220
liar?"
-1695810689

-1840324437
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
54354098
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
1607586830

-1840324437
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
-1545193857

-1840324437
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
-930622097
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
-1141920512

-1840324437
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
-2079336436

-1840324437
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
1783986197
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
-1536264768
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
1171003591
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
1912813831
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
399455586
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
-1024689995
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
-1525982705
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
-1572583877
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
-411464672

-1840324437
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
-672796989
gently to warm them, and went on--
-1012086241

-1840324437
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
-1063378403
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
-1156225995
without friends."
1610904564

-1840324437
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
645641438
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
1040494242
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
-391344801
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
-1722417202
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
720438327
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
-629615140

-1840324437
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
1515411666
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
275147398
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
-1090208658
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
-403963174
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
1545435674
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
713826742
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
-2095236813
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
-318924352
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
2061467987
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
1839237204
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
-958443580
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
-393908417
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
926637898
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
-303483900
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
-219142395

-1840324437
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
914394395
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
248503592
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
-340260618
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
471848162
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
1307308729

-1840324437
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
1178400415
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
1215673669
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
-1359760973
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
1165365898
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
-2080506724
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
-1305150030

-1840324437
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
-1064449237
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
711570860

-1840324437
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
-862346122
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
-899708347
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
-168765340
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
1136695238
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
802661296

-1840324437
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
135468466
your grief away?"
-826700211

-1840324437
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
-556287382

-1840324437
"Why?"
500216564

-1840324437
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
1504230165
will now think me wicked."
-109206614

-1840324437
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
2072325570
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
679379237

-1840324437
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
3113955

-1840324437
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
-384939530
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
-1987968584

-1840324437
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
1652325131
care."
1130336433

-1840324437
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
-1181149739

-1840324437
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
934263140
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
-895891866
always keep me."
-1324171737

-1840324437
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
-157667197
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
-484804385
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
1527160995
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
-274334607
exaggerate nothing."
655658021

-1840324437
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
176245801
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
-1100520166
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
-1381217598
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
-1056766426
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
-229396277
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
1229014307
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
1150522426
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
-1777898164
Temple fully believed me.
1497437732

-1840324437
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
-422072840
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
717284861
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
-2122830123
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
1949061438
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
348897821
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
-691267426

-1840324437
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
-1158176894
then said--
730644514

-1840324437
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
1269249060
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
824343615
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
702756422

-1840324437
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
1370838936
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
-2083657776
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
1948613269
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
898475189
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
-1049461635

-1840324437
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
1405070647

-1840324437
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
-1466588466

-1840324437
"And the pain in your chest?"
-691112231

-1840324437
"It is a little better."
128054797

-1840324437
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
884249587
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
-166198721
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
-421867629

-1840324437
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
-1037794727
rang her bell.
-893619141

-1840324437
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
-650368651
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
-1025303461

-1840324437
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
-1697661358
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
-220581751
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
2042354965
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
-375215339
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
1428940664

-1840324437
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
-59200780
There is not enough for three."
-1784704966

-1840324437
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
537035402

-1840324437
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
1118727625

-1840324437
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
302758695
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
-1171799557

-1840324437
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
1843572514
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
-786273984
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
2033800181

-1840324437
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
-1122759715
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
208056503
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
85968033
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
592259547

-1840324437
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
-1101709555
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
-1622723659
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
-1829237829

-1840324437
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
248865866
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
692140058
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
-1845692118
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
-1242767303

-1840324437
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
-1341072236
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
1067088102
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
-699088274

-1840324437
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
1767509441
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
-542399995
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
-949369689
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
813341242
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
383560297
struck with wonder.
-1909516129

-1840324437
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
-995015567
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
339689553
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
-818486698
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
-1577693852
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
728825230
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
1482689656
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
1289983661
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
-813743036
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
859596252
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
1406175450
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
-2096037841
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
-1529821232
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
240523929
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
-1150018300

-1840324437
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
-133110319
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
-880999371
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
-442336101
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
1588173825
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
1018442526
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
-1244655542
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
39262008
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
-1104817494
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
-799009335
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
-426546493
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
2137491526

-1840324437
"God bless you, my children!"
86487356

-1840324437
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
2143295609
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
1856586607
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
11905060

-1840324437
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
-1995603032
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
-1014940905
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
747871869
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
-2082872061
shoulder.
1787120348

-1840324437
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
-1655791127
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
1092637131

-1840324437
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
371286389
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
162980449
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
-1844873529
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
1033421254
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
-1687343776
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
634922983
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
1696651663
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
1372503055
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
277123675

-1840324437
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
-1551064894
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
2086290
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
1245156792
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
1840955544
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
-1246960517
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
217712964
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
1862814266
through the ranks of my companions.
1869086579

-1840324437
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
-2069006781
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
-1719399195
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
-273097303
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
381641848
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
-389282009
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
775371998
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
1666064937
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
268651815
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
413850201
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
192635814
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
-927381872
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
1178529362
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
279616860
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
-1972267877
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
2034860090
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
-613583505
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
1382016663
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
-129144049
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
-1533891535
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
1698399550

-1840324437
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
1845774206
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
2137739449

-1840324437
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
-39326445
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
-183400988

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER IX
303758375

-1840324437

-1840324437
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
146644144
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
1684329755
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
-933546364
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
1901215889
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
-1898846760
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
285004813
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
-1383586952
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
1185951309
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
-1737104429
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
1944985305
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
-987393656
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
743790491
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
386749302
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
-800887192

-1840324437
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
920693995
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
366478215
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
315412719
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
1201253760
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
940135521
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
-818066796
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
-1520392319
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
572127235
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
500882803
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
-1054120589
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
-686444889
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
1924438889
of skeletons.
-1893278276

-1840324437
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
-1286131860
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
1458072899
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
815267027
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
586892531
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
677397708
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
-903878148
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
-447359458
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
-1131923750
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
-1947329286
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
1003478703
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
-1803498308
advert.
-1637699763

-1840324437
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
173646942
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
1251295571
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
-503582408
question.
-1449446497

-1840324437
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
-1338560401
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
-2045290568
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
1864374153
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
29083445
hospital.
-430936105

-1840324437
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
1307374205
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
440116514
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
-1928650530
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
-1479378048
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
1345561151
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
-1734414552
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
1426857244
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
2019754642
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
2115280775
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
-1800683304
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
1874455955
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
1430687300
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
890559762
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
-1452663882

-1840324437
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
848649333
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
1500216013
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
69301384
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
2146358882
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
-438546363
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
-152300850
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
607351710
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
-226399389
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
627826493
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
1562305219
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
-65406662
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
-1928930904

-1840324437
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
1138298046
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
64156422
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
-1766462250
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
109791519
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
861751101
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
-141161343
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
1716388090
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
887736223
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
2025701660
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
-2113505868
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
-759320353
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
-758241398
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
1820372860

-1840324437
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
-1498636471
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
482118530
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
-969996696
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
-1145653496
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
311812137
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
-688029442
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
-580083409
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
-111371538
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
-2095490375
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
1652506901
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
967409202
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
-1619089905
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
-1288603968

-1840324437
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
-1958376748
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
-599462988
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
-655504931
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
-1890612739
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
1685355418
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
24195991
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
-673310577
higher things.
-837118274

-1840324437
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
-275666295
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
1199067286
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
121730583
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
-1436874886
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
-1176314525
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
-1812809653
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
1989101810
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
1670817972
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
-912897253
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
1860864073
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
-139903716
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
344791952
alleviate.
676377224

-1840324437
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
1549744306
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
-2143511089
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
2129903109
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
-710249154
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
1023956962
verandah.
-1534341741

-1840324437
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
-1387871474
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
1546800264
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
403495013
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
-992784732
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
1536994637
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
-1864227454
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
131357754
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
-712361538
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
-1928505968
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
-2062983716
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
735019541
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
-1923576137
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
494391265
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
-1130816952
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
1988000272
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
201338774
done before:--
1252815041

-1840324437
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
1857855021
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
1154370514
have to go who knows where?"
-1142055817

-1840324437
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
-295663306
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
12901130
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
360181898
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
-1916808970
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
541522343
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
-1940267494
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
-1767563854
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
2011377473
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
-52944038
ran up to her.
1082195743

-1840324437
"How is Helen Burns?"
-122966408

-1840324437
"Very poorly," was the answer.
-696727089

-1840324437
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
-1442900228

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"And what does he say about her?"
-583541913

-1840324437
"He says she'll not be here long."
-196085719

-1840324437
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
-1051164720
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
896522098
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
-293215910
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
950429081
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
-1442547525
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
-725408698
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
1350435774
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
1770965358

-1840324437
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
-244522901

-1840324437
"May I go up and speak to her?"
2046187901

-1840324437
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
259488846
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
-539418517

-1840324437
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
2079325648
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
687852888
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
-356509365

-1840324437
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
1346060299
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
-652957942
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
-642605758
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
1183310984
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
-1920047512
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
1320276948
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
536640593
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
-782113692
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
617491317
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
-1944400909
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
319750927
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
687518892
with her one last word.
-317834517

-1840324437
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
-2126720497
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
1919770341
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
-1484292330
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
-151036960
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
1476564308
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
-1490935209
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
-2046450263
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
1552295543
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
341469712

-1840324437
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
850342882
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
-83340885
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
94403682
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
-1574612737
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
-955872333
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
1594061256
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
-725130056
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
-1252652307
of seeing a corpse.
-1071075014

-1840324437
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
-366565444

-1840324437
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
1880716900
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
-401932622
instantly dissipated.
-351469233

-1840324437
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
-2040211863

-1840324437
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
1682838659
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
-22522103

-1840324437
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
-371628767
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
-723799843
old.
1770146281

-1840324437
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
-660267893
strike some minutes since."
337074429

-1840324437
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
-1212159310
sleep till I had spoken to you."
-1463986055

-1840324437
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
-957768141

-1840324437
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
916175577

-1840324437
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
-904151491

-1840324437
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
1831369311
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
576782768
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
1437213799
whispered--
-170005937

-1840324437
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
-1404238495
quilt."
383528785

-1840324437
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
-408815840
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
1998017224

-1840324437
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
-294487297
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
-1960862925
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
1902203944
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
731964166
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
-286366858
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
-1481414243
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
1921456833
been continually at fault."
-776017612

-1840324437
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
-489275143

-1840324437
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
344121246

-1840324437
"Where is God?  What is God?"
722042951

-1840324437
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
2119391611
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
-39879629
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
58046788
reveal Him to me."
-211468528

-1840324437
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
346125588
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
591848824

-1840324437
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
-1468896895
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
-962796434
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
1186572985

-1840324437
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
371147028

-1840324437
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
-923049075
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
29714870

-1840324437
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
-113789630
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
1372949282
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
569541045
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
3037371
tone--
69762409

-1840324437
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
-2013072040
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
1655255741
near me."
-1331446171

-1840324437
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
-252551369

-1840324437
"Are you warm, darling?"
-238236498

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Good-night, Jane."
1031693241

-1840324437
"Good-night, Helen."
-280132608

-1840324437
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
747436224

-1840324437
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
1377769453
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
265384629
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
696396936
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
505236194
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
-1542313658
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
-286529657
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
99159910
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
-480084211

-1840324437
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
-10515303
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
1836364047
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
-541236168

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER X
-1309460565

-1840324437

-1840324437
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
-1297589942
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
669191135
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
-1539539428
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
970681787
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
1343774146
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
-451450856
connection.
328030579

-1840324437
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
-1546613328
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
1422771038
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
1104137401
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
-1753866149
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
-721728902
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
-1568974597
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
1081409789
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
375777776
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
-120625278
beneficial to the institution.
459361944

-1840324437
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
883644682
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
172180791
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
-571681359
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
-90453100
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
1031349769
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
-1820231716
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
-568405167
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
1951298458
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
-681721128
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
1349652140
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
946415683
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
-315589487
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
-1231870958
testimony to its value and importance.
1881297623

-1840324437
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
-1223583664
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
1388423708
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
-460450630
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
-1049197183
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
-402590839
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
-502352318
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
-668750176
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
-798008799

-1840324437
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
-1877364941
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
-1341160709
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
-536210060
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
-583530067
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
-1796809393
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
-530132565
county, and consequently was lost to me.
1601787553

-1840324437
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
1375962084
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
878715321
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
-1157385758
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
-731371697
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
-667021584
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
-1542008123
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
-1609143937
character.
1646401153

-1840324437
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
1387943367
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
1974867778
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
241203420
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
-1340345668
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
-1245297043
of the occasion.
1185665466

-1840324437
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
-605659989
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
620419321
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
934375171
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
-660312921
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
1969386544
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
324036369
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
104463120
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
273524615
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
1538897170
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
-111664874
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
-141214486
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
286740928
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
595804782
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
1829569125
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
272125674
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
-1746723699

-1840324437
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
1139226875
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
-1716645336
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
16075740
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
-1800077859
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
144382508
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
1270879035
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
-212541440
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
-961587456
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
1549788405
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
395037827
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
286951127
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
39083057
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
-1285211161
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
-1135787139
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
790472017
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
-1583987368
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
443445753
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
-1599154059
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
-1207489219
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
1449864935
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
846389813
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
-122390700

-1840324437
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
-528788689

-1840324437
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
1240122990
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
447576330
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
1544228550
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
-675687844
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
-1829898465
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
-2036136628

-1840324437
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
1331726398
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
-1310899035
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
-984069304
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
1993535933
instantly revived.
1101301541

-1840324437
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
692676798
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
-1588723468
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
1215817625
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
525499566
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
504438820
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
27114314
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
-1988978354
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
-1791979052
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
-1502895211
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
-2064591112

-1840324437
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
1600612460
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
777369460
think_ again with all my might.
2058559255

-1840324437
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
1678681947
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
-1263493802
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
703449234
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
-1719325994
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
-1245395606
their resource?"
980754853

-1840324437
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
1483776029
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
-2054388011
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
-1304926440
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
-1420116767
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
1324456588
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
-1684446639

-1840324437
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
529849160
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
-801488748
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
1874083263
_---shire Herald_."
1727120376

-1840324437
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
1779539016

-1840324437
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
-27909299

-1840324437
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
-1110892604
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
-1374717116
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
1820549173
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
127839092
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
-1901229607

-1840324437
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
1100990302
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
1447740355

-1840324437
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
479475920
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
-374331465

-1840324437
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
1568228974
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
1368881207
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
508515290
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
71707072
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
-229762276
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
1326724175
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
-1110129080
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
-1517380336
shire."
-1713875630

-1840324437
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
-860706521
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
552527972
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
1278298762
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
1754296658
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
1786039594
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
889181353
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
-1150825919

-1840324437
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
1503662568
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
-812492051
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
362575806
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
1438390314
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
-1307448575
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
1930103133
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
-138610563

-1840324437
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
-154704344
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
1727590422
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
-1240948883
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
-1407952681
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
-231189300

-1840324437
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
-1536996006

-1840324437
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
1422258226
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
1483639551
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
961673639
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
-1065511192
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
1482137726

-1840324437
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
85448587

-1840324437
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
1326794970
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
-354665557
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
720622305

-1840324437
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
416319769
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
-1486633952
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
670095123
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
1836811118
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
-1908948838
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
1802068930
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
1372025746
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
-1675701870
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
-44492037
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
2035927946

-1840324437
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
1311925529
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
2117103765
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
313872548
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
-12728220
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
-1044585125
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
256206000
direction:--
1348263255

-1840324437
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
-851626985

-1840324437
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
-994431495
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
-2078613187
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
471121792
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
-1281504979
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
-1492288968
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
1521362977
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
-820798496
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
-1295690296
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
1853986744
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
-388667965
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
508260502
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
722737263
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
-1068050083
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
1073627459
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
861417958
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
133653108
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
-298978796
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
1740188689
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
1461327788
probably, be a good way from the town."
1750508962

-1840324437
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
-1113964322

-1840324437
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
576992871
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
1948887880
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
-750689590
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
-424656814
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
53808148
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
-2114119385
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
1984399790
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
107572954
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
1392702150
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
790560828
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
-1032820941
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
-888263512
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
-1010567968
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
1101284221
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
962939299
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
-2040375554
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
1578949807
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
1085611917
forthwith be furnished me.
-1219233094

-1840324437
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
-924992886
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
1668587920
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
-2004282993
assuming the post of governess in her house.
1353091210

-1840324437
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
-362540676
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
632427317
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
72721742
years ago from Gateshead.
-1337124754

-1840324437
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
201561595
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
-1280635801
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
1162636131
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
460853838
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
764436000
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
1151127285
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
-1945251544
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
1695158612
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
1974345775
while the change was being accomplished.
-310069291

-1840324437
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
-2080658694
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
203461492

-1840324437
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
-939968596
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
-619479972
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
-803933513

-1840324437
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
-1973866463
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
-528790984

-1840324437
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
-1456750238
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
-607792027
complexion.
-984813345

-1840324437
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
-631263151
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
-2103079962

-1840324437
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
616805639
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
947808263
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
433149188
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
1890874505

-1840324437
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
659827640

-1840324437
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
-1560284248

-1840324437
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
400172617
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
1639591014

-1840324437
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
1221900060

-1840324437
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
-402276594

-1840324437
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
1125883630
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
1318016994
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
-278229603

-1840324437
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
161577065
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
-1307176687
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
1018128831
would make two of you in breadth."
-1317801567

-1840324437
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
-1270580616

-1840324437
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
-328672447
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
-1903467232
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
1442114187
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
-1894453144
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
836701599
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
1357638602
quarrelling--"
-1287076729

-1840324437
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
-1617420619

-1840324437
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
-1048740044
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
1753037132
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
-201247892
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
-1244541909

-1840324437
"What does he look like?"
2063895581

-1840324437
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
1283760424
has such thick lips."
1903614495

-1840324437
"And Mrs. Reed?"
654229103

-1840324437
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
-687495137
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
56070861
a deal of money."
-1992567240

-1840324437
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
713863147

-1840324437
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
-280100200
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
-1223981999
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
386489571
you were quite out of my reach."
571452289

-1840324437
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
-296570389
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
-1488290400
shape denote admiration.
1970721229

-1840324437
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
774062676
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
1571965806
a child."
-1158079069

-1840324437
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
1984271655
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
2119981265
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
1668465348
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
117131215

-1840324437
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
-969412693
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
1294998954

-1840324437
"A little."
-766907418

-1840324437
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
257867927
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
-1611888005
charmed.
-1385012446

-1840324437
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
-488057044
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
-1732109833

-1840324437
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
-49982352
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
44012769
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
-859856201
and which she had framed and glazed.
489617947

-1840324437
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
-746628658
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
1213131799
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
1139181832

-1840324437
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
1388164496

-1840324437
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
-792767403

-1840324437
"I can."
175575656

-1840324437
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
-2043705279
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
847298014
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
1328240938
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
899611491

-1840324437
"Never in my life."
1212177504

-1840324437
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
1480732047
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
980589104
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
450670250
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
698867361
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
-947179174
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
-1775252006
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
-558952956
father's brother."
-1831065328

-1840324437
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
332653143

-1840324437
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
-2093842564
tell me--"
-2067765224

-1840324437
"Madeira?" I suggested.
-1610676589

-1840324437
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
-1175103674

-1840324437
"So he went?"
555599773

-1840324437
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
1269802111
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
325553284
believes he was a wine-merchant."
-1844774684

-1840324437
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
1227363580
wine-merchant."
43187057

-1840324437
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
-35149479
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
-1757326351
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
590769015
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
303363556
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
1171308145
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
-2075337078
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
177356176

-1840324437
CHAPTER XI
-836265510

-1840324437

-1840324437
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
396860168
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
-853362139
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
763333772
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
818990276
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
-1665179765
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
1566045135
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
-873104586
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
-1593424454
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
-1540854146
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
-849538375
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
1601203583
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
716373493

-1840324437
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
-454138605
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
170557931
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
2002553325
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
1721184172
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
-1081381314
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
1153795153
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
387667596
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
443899922
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
-946472496
troubling my thoughts.
-1952044779

-1840324437
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
798399226
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
2038113594
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
-1922442791
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
357053625
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
439029790
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
1496800039
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
1715776495
the bell.
-1916911590

-1840324437
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
-501811629
the waiter who answered the summons.
-1786753701

-1840324437
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
172669271
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
540789231

-1840324437
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
-1757249459

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Person here waiting for you."
1424654547

-1840324437
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
877996091
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
544032804
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
353260917

-1840324437
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
-1895747038
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
964369780

-1840324437
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
-54962893
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
2012940391
Thornfield.
950286166

-1840324437
"A matter of six miles."
1689328418

-1840324437
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
-215279129

-1840324437
"Happen an hour and a half."
633621799

-1840324437
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
1444098058
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
-660405106
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
1893871061
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
-1478303789
much at my ease.
2146607130

-1840324437
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
-1194702427
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
451747493
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
-821437754
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
1111305618
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
-348757091
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
1291634143
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
-1965445009
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
-858014635
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
1437980232
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
2050713108
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
-315615183
road now, I wonder?"
1200728837

-1840324437
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
-940822539
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
1382085077
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
-1579635145
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
-677294725
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
1667617434
more stirring, less romantic.
884347909

-1840324437
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
1592679448
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
-1119405571
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
-130864941

-1840324437
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
-1231031453

-1840324437
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
1413237894
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
-2102174948
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
810197618
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
606745232
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
-705831029
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
-230654498
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
284456518
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
947309751

-1840324437
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
-1452755470
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
-657033202
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
-1109717169
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
-378965811
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
1129937429
itself to my view.
633721383

-1840324437
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
1112293520
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
1357588569
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
958159666
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
-1635066119
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
1424442986
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
-2057819506
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
-1997682916
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
-421641660
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
1446815393
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
352388524

-1840324437
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
1044483592
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
1492275854

-1840324437
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
-1993283924

-1840324437
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
-1497659467

-1840324437
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
546564304
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
759387640
trouble.
-2142516910

-1840324437
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
-2035971824
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
1928880531
the keys of the storeroom."
-774846530

-1840324437
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
1704118595
delivered them to the servant.
781981711

-1840324437
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
-1563205923
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
795866072

-1840324437
"Yes, ma'am."
1007777469

-1840324437
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
1744019101

-1840324437
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
1632164209
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
-714530946
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
449603331
too soon."
271430925

-1840324437
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
1020221294
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
1916959239
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
-817950223
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
-574300392
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
-937782489
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
195948791
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
940176961

-1840324437
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
-1824184152
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
158610598

-1840324437
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
1070005040
approaching her ear to my mouth.
1006423349

-1840324437
I repeated the question more distinctly.
242707485

-1840324437
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
743228055
future pupil."
1302831910

-1840324437
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
-1270282122

-1840324437
"No,--I have no family."
550874932

-1840324437
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
-1055245950
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
1070380151
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
-264461044

-1840324437
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
2040838034
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
-1625983864
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
-102365409
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
-1520013892
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
146228119
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
-1050312542
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
-2146518113
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
-491264635
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
872723106
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
1133332646
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
55557461
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
-913062864
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
-497860026
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
938267592
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
106727056
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
-1407532722
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
-1775137229
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
1130918051
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
1154952268

-1840324437
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
-2073019754
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
1822677282
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
-269435767

-1840324437
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
587342460
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
211428195
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
619826196
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
-222134650
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
-377177180
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
-1077277856
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
404130157

-1840324437
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
-630788676
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
741268960
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
708716653
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
1969623037
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
299210480
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
-1424007676
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
443895648
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
-460400510
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
566414029
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
-224807418
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
-290957502

-1840324437
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
1560593250
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
1872584590
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
-539319848
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
1025614880
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
-614323845
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
-337591344
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
-146450037
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
-241863628
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
-801030332
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
-1558153747
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
1334110186
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
837345218

-1840324437
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
887808437
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
1999796543
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
-1847107479
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
394948160
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
-1580036138
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
485337476
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
2115044642
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
940660564
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
2143224536
an indefinite future period.
-1242327195

-1840324437
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
1332296932
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
1648057847
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
-461495320
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
-985331558
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
2042656056
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
1950601510
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
-1280261939
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
1170926319
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
643043889
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
-1055424314
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
1519589204
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
-319606549
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
-95546128
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
351012412
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
-729355740
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
93151026
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
-791725714
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
2036065015
toilet table, I ventured forth.
-2041631892

-1840324437
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
-180454897
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
-436790325
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
-1008992727
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
-305103741
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
1081685989
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
-2016755139
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
-923806730
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
1558558857
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
-570423534
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
1304964237
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
695727483
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
1108054467
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
901931075
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
1872472210
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
719858021
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
1315714412
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
2112905049
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
552468334
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
-365854693
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
395174535
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
-699259543
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
-2016305609
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
-468321489
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
1364146832
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
-1430786861
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
-1851677721
house and gates.
-1553849643

-1840324437
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
829231053
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
31162519
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
386960775
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
-660809905
appeared at the door.
577687385

-1840324437
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
2106088783
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
2065909444

-1840324437
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
1776458408
much.
1225336459

-1840324437
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
-1221964889
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
-532762976
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
-1483898908
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
-1122673833

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
-237178621

-1840324437
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
-496749495
was called Rochester?"
2023455252

-1840324437
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
-631284164
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
312138273
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
628153373

-1840324437
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
1975082459

-1840324437
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
-1400389275
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
1353608625
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
867461189
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
-1532950875
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
-2003680332
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
-2002754436
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
-1851173449
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
-976322310
expect nothing more."
1575575230

-1840324437
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
1238764607

-1840324437
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
-807164179
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
1204249098
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
1253089760
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
-259430094
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
-959242116
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
-1529003428
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
-2037428393
the better--my position was all the freer.
-850715910

-1840324437
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
1773175347
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
1859355270
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
749217283
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
1284210587
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
990717482

-1840324437
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
-1976109825
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
-2118061010
approached.
1349185375

-1840324437
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
-27978679
nurse; who answered--
1260301780

-1840324437
"Mais oui, certainement."
-223701068

-1840324437
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
429636421

-1840324437
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
-902739160
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
-711258407
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
-1494681440
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
844763581
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
1027819450

-1840324437
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
-1085802690
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
364764899
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
-292427608
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
1807397148
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
-397196296
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
-1582828309
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
-971347825
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
964572442
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
1217712544
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
-951490251
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
-202031340
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
1327699252

-1840324437
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
-1949033431
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
361673032
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
-983808860
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
1828425020
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
589405857
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
2095059175
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
-2108119637
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
-5832049
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
-300319730

-1840324437
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
-1523277130

-1840324437
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
-1040165713
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
-1097934710
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
1608230259
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
410810956
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
1437175832
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
-1306653359
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
2074523598
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
2147062860
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
-1583640141
fed with crumbs."
-1573517701

-1840324437
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
470912790

-1840324437
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
676391204
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
339542714

-1840324437
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
15905490
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
1091576852

-1840324437
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
-1686119151
clean town you spoke of?"
1403393508

-1840324437
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
-555896845
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
-1654671697
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
357182828
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
-2006190533
hear me sing now?"
-1535654339

-1840324437
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
66442500
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
-1785492035
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
355440519
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
-973855843
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
228304443
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
-1072590021
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
1549662950
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
-645700179
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
-196134912
affected her.
-1016431956

-1840324437
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
-1620003891
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
1380769399
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
2038062121
at least I thought so.
1181904568

-1840324437
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
-1571264572
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
1560190935
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
-2049114368

-1840324437
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
-460831442
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
-2098038521
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
1440162
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
1533759709
carefully trained.
635516697

-1840324437
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
2146220974

-1840324437
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
-1476548257
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
1619226776
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
-369766104

-1840324437
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
1726819452
say, with whom did you live then?"
1764656431

-1840324437
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
-627639142
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
-1763320527
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
-1296855125
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
-1803289383
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
314130778
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
-891077900
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
1568320234
and I never see him."
96846629

-1840324437
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
-1137217250
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
-1729970524
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
-1508346502
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
-1255842168
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
-1629697710
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
-618238264
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
960692784
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
1916895921
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
-362292672
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
-1802145048
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
866058799
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
1891285565

-1840324437
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
-941293662
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
-2017322316
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
1298511733
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
-1143235530
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
735512306
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
36767093
use.
1183367214

-1840324437
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
1281618421
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
-111267219
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
2013552168
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
-322248836
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
-412835464
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
620798676
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
-64625432
sideboard.
1019658061

-1840324437
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
1851768454
before seen any half so imposing.
-1615940769

-1840324437
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
244806365
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
-1504322677
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
-1354673576

-1840324437
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
-980601689
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
366969257
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
1031275212
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
-1505449637
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
214557288
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
688789659
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
1708740291
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
1446806714
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
-1201035307
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
-1482621726
general blending of snow and fire.
1210031951

-1840324437
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
1380092720
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
1675487873
were inhabited daily."
-1599641786

-1840324437
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
-798070171
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
302615707
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
1794463351
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
-642751082

-1840324437
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
-102401386

-1840324437
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
233731032
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
1082457787

-1840324437
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
-411920719

-1840324437
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
-2025905424
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
1352970511
Rochesters time out of mind."
870045807

-1840324437
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
-1474534265
liked for himself?"
233861690

-1840324437
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
1984601533
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
542615334
lived much amongst them."
-1737538608

-1840324437
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
-2055905515

-1840324437
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
1183682205
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
-1780657699
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
-1632446726
conversation with him."
-1693741428

-1840324437
"In what way is he peculiar?"
-761537980

-1840324437
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
-887263180
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
1381711100
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
577972650
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
918278463
he is a very good master."
228507025

-1840324437
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
957342962
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
1345754209
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
-1121717751
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
-1806232033
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
1637174587
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
-699967229
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
1857910723
definite notion of his identity.
324896564

-1840324437
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
1743074687
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
1135447431
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
808016092
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
492966789
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
1974887121
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
435691801
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
1453260667
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
-586686318
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
-716452695
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
-334877516
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
-1391511019
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
-90030456
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
-1244155774
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
1363333707
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
846338396
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
423943955
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
1316201415
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
33107025
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
1857468578
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
1996792047
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
-451285860

-1840324437
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
1431943762

-1840324437
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
-1974757219
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
-947552679
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
-1193349083

-1840324437
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
1979858597

-1840324437
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
559865196

-1840324437
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
1749219048

-1840324437
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
-101492300
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
-1197220082
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
-1158436413

-1840324437
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
-1396656718
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
2135983033

-1840324437
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
511758923
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
714742053
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
1630881630
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
1911860936
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
-1617153734
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
308337313
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
1940731391
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
656579806
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
1723031961
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
626792222
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
-70363804
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
252247275
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
1468681612
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
-1159124537
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
212932348
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
-1193953090
over which I had been gazing with delight.
-1784963271

-1840324437
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
13790399
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
1333720087
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
-630023850
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
1195002403
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
483443622
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
-1205325573
Bluebeard's castle.
-27334001

-1840324437
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
1779839227
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
1212002598
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
1038052747
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
-1153912827
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
-809276224
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
2140799294
out the door whence the accents issued.
-257078226

-1840324437
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
-1401957877
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
-308362084

-1840324437
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
-131855233

-1840324437
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
-141495930

-1840324437
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
1166261997
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
-547435534

-1840324437
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
1692982205
odd murmur.
-1150158413

-1840324437
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
-596112144

-1840324437
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
1521990132
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
-1762045902
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
-1587731128
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
-1643896698
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
-602412021
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
2132368853

-1840324437
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
-1549615653
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
-1719401002
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
1718794964
be conceived.
-1451125659

-1840324437
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
264489473
curtseyed silently and went in.
-638042479

-1840324437
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
1673860635
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
1220954798
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
1513621924
pupil this morning?"
337481037

-1840324437
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
1028040732
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
2053299782
hall, exclaiming--
-1863071350

-1840324437
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
2041376128

-1840324437
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.

CHAPTER XII
495576164

-1840324437

-1840324437
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
-1620630917
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
2048517269
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
931423856
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
1643257663
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
595245686
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
-293430876
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
-138628346
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
1499559126
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
-635894773
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
258752105
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
-1337057893
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
-1333302849
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
775475710
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
376164795
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
755492483
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
2107264399

-1840324437
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
2098590854
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
1254319808
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
1698719200
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
-1714564927
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
-498873098
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
-159014940
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
-1880040156
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
1466201650
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
346752800
of her mind and character.
-118680389

-1840324437
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
-545687248
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
-624137853
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
-2072596821
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
563897836
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
-1237580513
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
838696343
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
513710456
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
-1697585938
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
8825945
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
-1630045695
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
890089432
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
-1451962924
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
1358830106
what I believed in I wished to behold.
1890112205

-1840324437
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
1373219919
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
1456638554
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
-61373964
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
-1204844503
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
1843757102
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
1072538504
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
618479762
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
761282270
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
808361678
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
-1238883221
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
661378682

-1840324437
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
-1907021242
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
-1547644743
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
-236706744
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
549780165
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
973989283
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
-1763321187
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
1199778018
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
901615844
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
-291690316
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
-1186986588
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
-232122954
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
2130204863
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
-1469722664
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
-2040918409

-1840324437
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
1151462929
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
-353251871
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
-1875178061
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
-728369145
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
-1782743322
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
760496930
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
273730228
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
-1000256871
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
-1219356282
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
-375079933
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
326455853
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
-929302465
every effort of that sort.
-1814273341

-1840324437
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
2023867967
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
-651798876
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
-644237921
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
757718005
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
-598475643
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
-888439595

-1840324437
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
-1982474976
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
-1621504356
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
1754307111
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
-54454414
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
862895939
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
-590926955
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
634904956
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
-1010919095
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
-12960348
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
862127308
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
915880030
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
1778897431
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
-1933421985
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
-1293319956
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
-545854941

-1840324437
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
1124551026
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
404058095
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
367593944
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
386319609
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
211627092
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
-1373543965
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
40271470
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
-206908748
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
-1263404005
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
1928951721
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
1169890580
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
1845888686
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
2057093890
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
930612783
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
238247560

-1840324437
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
-96875426
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
-506036660
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
690651415
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
928151501
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
-2114450559
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
-637217459
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
-2112703667
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
-1205491105
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
-1293618970
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
-1267146735

-1840324437
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
1313428308
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
1471705199
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
265248689
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
-750175081
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
-846752299
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
-722594871
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
-1767829999
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
-1386245244

-1840324437
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
-1750893793
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
-1661493236
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
2111543947
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
1921827676
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
567128770
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
1785355367

-1840324437
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
-1709565418
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
1988033634
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
-1005216131
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
1814570019
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
663207030
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
2116023557
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
-991520943
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
1750601757
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
-1180283521
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
1043706678
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
-527446840
me.
597905161

-1840324437
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
127757616
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
-2132653335
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
1513457561
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
1697888169
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
739173872
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
121534238
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
437743921
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
-234585045
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
1620527856
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
-1491665506
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
1060795329
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
-1239809906
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
1435536557
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
-746556286
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
881204968
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
-1759169922
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
1339444132
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
-2067295145
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
-1013757876
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
-1180170613
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
-1896306412
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
1186967668
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
-700441520

-1840324437
"Are you injured, sir?"
684014647

-1840324437
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
-28763321
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
-861032153

-1840324437
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
1683534502

-1840324437
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
-35254051
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
-925575625
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
-1028763103
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
523645474
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
1561855619
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
1963441872
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
1139605033
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
45944855
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
-269191008

-1840324437
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
730816878
now drew near him again.
-391089659

-1840324437
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
-776806028
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
1100183106

-1840324437
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
919344679
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
-661038925
involuntary "Ugh!"
-1015977428

-1840324437
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
1493641292
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
-1556457569
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
-579392241
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
1902768166
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
-2064834044
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
-448118485
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
989358151
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
2006601990
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
-117167774
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
-908329487
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
-69725045
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
-491520935
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
241120974
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
281913060
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
4850784
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
20690809

-1840324437
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
58857611
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
811921974
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
1456682036
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
2014133074
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
-938299197

-1840324437
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
918934317
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
-1335452971

-1840324437
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
2120808384
direction before.
864452568

-1840324437
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
-319763271
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
-749428645

-1840324437
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
-1920678059
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
-1320709853
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
-418631235

-1840324437
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
1891273971
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
1662880204
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
1302916950
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
374711139

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Whose house is it?"
1385171931

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester's."
126728761

-1840324437
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
-155032278

-1840324437
"No, I have never seen him."
-1190044711

-1840324437
"He is not resident, then?"
540028395

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Can you tell me where he is?"
2134652537

-1840324437
"I cannot."
-1132437490

-1840324437
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
-282734803
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
-757589248
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
717619409
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
-414825737

-1840324437
"I am the governess."
-1502729924

-1840324437
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
-1413802229
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
342689506
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
-1326294005

-1840324437
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
436388237
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
-2097997768

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
832021255

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
1239536056
afraid?"
188664682

-1840324437
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
295484697
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
-1449650808
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
1721433685
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
-1572973847
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
-363410323
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
1047394756
he laughed.
2089248691

-1840324437
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
-465414206

-1840324437
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
-1496970145
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
82441635
come here."
-1343822695

-1840324437
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
-235778693
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
-675617396
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
90554183
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
-799727564
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
1571363310

-1840324437
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
-463929689
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
1545160080

-1840324437
I sought it and found it.
1894461403

-1840324437
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
1374143585
you can."
1868202548

-1840324437
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
-982533884
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
2018954873

-1840324437
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
345019659
   The wild wind whirls away."
-1328579934

-1840324437
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
432535052
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
-1872778592
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
-1959920201
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
-1141059929
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
-359594943
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
67058185
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
1490846579
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
164693122
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
996291572
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
-1254231820
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
959713099
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
1523465786
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
1525212239
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
1020660746
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
1816739775
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
-115003838
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
-1950564097
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
1456394038
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
-1065892229
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
-676892791

-1840324437
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
948917293
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
-2100214170
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
58821747
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
1124985328
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
-1892032090
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
-114575842
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
393708897
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
499789595
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
-999680527
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
640055850
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
298792294
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
-1621993398
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
-982110735
as it would be under his.
-1075442217

-1840324437
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
2094921372
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
-1515092099
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
-879931909
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
-152723824
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
180667106
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
-706293081
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
-1864030472
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
991108971
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
1932699791
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
893638514
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
-1958314276
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
6749312
door, and went in.
447205679

-1840324437
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
-936455623
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
1256373444
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
-1065652844
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
-1380911583
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
1917676694
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
-478439316
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
1347219642
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
-1901670362
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
-1785045375

-1840324437
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
608378734
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
-1965882813
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
-39503488
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
51476827
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
596735953
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
576919408
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
-1414523610
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
1242782002
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
-1057187130

-1840324437
"What dog is this?"
-1616846626

-1840324437
"He came with master."
961060320

-1840324437
"With whom?"
1608180727

-1840324437
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
-1690984053

-1840324437
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
-1764128154

-1840324437
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
862888799
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
-548887593
sprained."
421481232

-1840324437
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
-1662730245

-1840324437
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
1253612559

-1840324437
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
-408841350

-1840324437
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
-82861401
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
1032554346
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
-397272829
upstairs to take off my things.
182613036

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XIII
-36731652

-1840324437

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
1315704096
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
654319449
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
-382149643
and waiting to speak with him.
-526589805

-1840324437
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
1368298804
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
1257615378
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
-1368403399
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
-2014637073
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
-441761862
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
381129734
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
-1101648046
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
1103524603
master: for my part, I liked it better.
1482816725

-1840324437
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
47001948
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
-708347265
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
999435130
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
-1038195562
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
998341645
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
-978364389
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
1000142954
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
1606502159
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
1938111664
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
317018565
box in whose contents she had an interest.
-1941579930

-1840324437
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
1504125526
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
807939065
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
1161785133
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
678640774
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
777280705

-1840324437
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
1486858154
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
-1292845022
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
666729426
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
1678917602
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
-130990067
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
-16588129
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
2040601190
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
-1846393173
fireside.
-1331639798

-1840324437
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
1115969829
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
1166650415
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
1481216749
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
1800015220
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
1327207597

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
-844537436
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
-915287802
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
-919822832

-1840324437
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
748218647

-1840324437
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
1394850820
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
-2071912907
candle."
265857968

-1840324437
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
-630243944

-1840324437
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
-439694306
is here."
529502501

-1840324437
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
-2007718378
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
1918192648
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
818184146
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
-297904862
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
-1163532181

-1840324437
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
1354429357
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
-1746551628
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
-1952600082
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
-1603973107
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
-753330925
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
-44910247
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
1007564556

-1840324437
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
1459013446
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
-772159569
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
792348619
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
-94369350
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
1058212073
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
-587143175
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
626301637
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
1236333509
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
-1053420338
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
-1146030062
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
1425914883
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
964904611
neither tall nor graceful.
-1192557066

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
-1915815109
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
-578404670
lifted his head as we approached.
46633173

-1840324437
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
620727286
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
2032593436

-1840324437
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
2003608779
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
1183529185
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
211666689
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
-1887402058

-1840324437
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
-2061365226
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
433868993
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
624284284
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
1516008807
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
854719721
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
393439449

-1840324437
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
-1216431178
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
1519806941
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
-568042511
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
851926919
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
-504236298
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
959692105

-1840324437
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
-722390052
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
1065395686
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
521234442
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
-1890862227

-1840324437
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
220888301
might perhaps spill it."
1332672420

-1840324437
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
-1998293151
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
-634703912

-1840324437
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
-1570843026
votre petit coffre?"
-24540101

-1840324437
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
-1395563003
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
1143885065
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
-1021191310

-1840324437
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
-194122069
thought pleasant things."
-1465272665

-1840324437
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
-1978430102

-1840324437
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
4225673
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
-1824755075
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
-1112386401
nature."
930367308

-1840324437
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
-689530445
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
1002709471

-1840324437
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
2075968897
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
983250791
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
320483610
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
-910408433
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
1783983682

-1840324437
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
667599657
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
-2076706694
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
206160246

-1840324437
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
-317657212
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
-1765070123

-1840324437
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
1829180088

-1840324437
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
-1323833945
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
789954805
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
-2025581415
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
-99823638
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
-1805679053
amuse herself with Pilot.
1738565283

-1840324437
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
283706422

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And you came from--?"
-1389344028

-1840324437
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
1827757076

-1840324437
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
610103197

-1840324437
"Eight years."
-1934103755

-1840324437
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
-1499423299
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
55240035
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
1944673223
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
-1549591654
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
863772000
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
-1001865591

-1840324437
"I have none."
1138641334

-1840324437
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
1978039834

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
397184692
that stile?"
156174836

-1840324437
"For whom, sir?"
-1252715230

-1840324437
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
1660314718
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
376091193
causeway?"
-1479429081

-1840324437
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
-122163330
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
-6616771
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
1687965304
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
-1985392206
revels more."
1989696307

-1840324437
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
-629152441
wondering what sort of talk this was.
1443620059

-1840324437
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
43944016
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
388041895

-1840324437
"No; none that I ever saw."
-247952190

-1840324437
"And your home?"
-371044204

-1840324437
"I have none."
1138641334

-1840324437
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
1573218748

-1840324437
"I have no brothers or sisters."
2107762404

-1840324437
"Who recommended you to come here?"
-1183373312

-1840324437
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
1894243663

-1840324437
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
1720856494
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
-2070701893
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
1503983076
Adele."
-1667910500

-1840324437
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
-1098552823
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
-1748306420
felling my horse."
-1257335251

-1840324437
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
828561503

-1840324437
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
-1127522028

-1840324437
The widow looked bewildered.
-2100633971

-1840324437
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
12669610

-1840324437
"No, sir."
-1824508055

-1840324437
"Have you seen much society?"
31698906

-1840324437
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
-183740747
Thornfield."
46891524

-1840324437
"Have you read much?"
-678500405

-1840324437
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
-1272503030
very learned."
311368252

-1840324437
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
2029372458
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
2057615904
parson, is he not?"
-1311022897

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
368617852
would worship their director."
-752178870

-1840324437
"Oh, no."
-1485522315

-1840324437
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
-1422848344
sounds blasphemous."
-1013562263

-1840324437
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
1538274588
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
1434627771
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
-968544008
hardly sew."
1424257349

-1840324437
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
1238578925
caught the drift of the dialogue.
1332067847

-1840324437
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
1547695006
Rochester.
21625580

-1840324437
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
-499094502
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
405490887
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
-1764406959
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
213846386
to bed."
1357725017

-1840324437
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
1601228831

-1840324437
"About ten."
99864191

-1840324437
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
-411232483

-1840324437
I assented.
-1555972162

-1840324437
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
-635978271
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
930607916
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
693221181
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
-157077021

-1840324437
"A little."
-766907418

-1840324437
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
660822551
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
1257072628
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
-1316984941
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
1441993510
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
-471201493

-1840324437
I departed, obeying his directions.
-1934654355

-1840324437
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
-748514978
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
-104942275
not well."
214022543

-1840324437
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
1702585574
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
1281093663
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
-1553147600

-1840324437
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
756556900

-1840324437
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
-746408601
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
834147801
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
-358911451

-1840324437
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
940213965

-1840324437
I brought the portfolio from the library.
-154547151

-1840324437
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
969305794
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
-566770294

-1840324437
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
1736966992
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
2030489463

-1840324437
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
-2094115201
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
982591995

-1840324437
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
2029148787
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
-2016835641
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
1711485601
hand yours?"
202459802

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
919898874
some thought."
504476268

-1840324437
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
1254464206
other occupation."
-409789654

-1840324437
"Where did you get your copies?"
-1201399922

-1840324437
"Out of my head."
-1330011872

-1840324437
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
-743361413

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
-1415402119

-1840324437
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
-614027703

-1840324437
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
2045394652

-1840324437
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
502400126
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
-1211242724
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
-143042423
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
2067218560
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
-414097205
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
-568437329

-1840324437
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
-1606492612
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
1392470137
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
2077473892
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
-1261130541
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
1453403241
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
-511181786
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
1254816821
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
-412589676
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
-1362115353
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
190628654

-1840324437
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
-405094395
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
1646346089
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
224734712
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
439151353
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
1286938769
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
-273011573
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
-1058424268
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
1957350299
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
-1574852099
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
525680893

-1840324437
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
1300502373
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
2004397062
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
206126844
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
1420819836
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
384193784
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
-90778144
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
908683572
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
207795471
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
-1772453498
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
958365770
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
-1937722046
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
-1482079109

-1840324437
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
1061968632
presently.
1986038171

-1840324437
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
1880658930
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
-1259258917

-1840324437
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
399992365
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
1365148265
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
-640091312
each day?"
-854756245

-1840324437
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
455825407
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
978792338
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
-573939454

-1840324437
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
-849383746

-1840324437
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
2114666765
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
262173360
powerless to realise."
1143586151

-1840324437
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
-277531781
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
-465164876
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
1007633884
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
701733623
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
-492893917
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
520750450
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
-1588874481
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
-1686963598
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
58106891

-1840324437
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
1774311932
watch, he said abruptly--
-1821538151

-1840324437
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
95984653
so long?  Take her to bed."
-551744701

-1840324437
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
-2068347491
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
-112502535
much.
1225336459

-1840324437
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
-1694553499
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
-1602324916
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
1077216822
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
-878408608

-1840324437
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
216520958
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
-417871640

-1840324437
"Well, is he?"
-1651838043

-1840324437
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
685643240

-1840324437
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
-1175672069
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
-1409031946
temper, allowance should be made."
-2068834691

-1840324437
"Why?"
500216564

-1840324437
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
-1008514321
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
1941454306
make his spirits unequal."
1643705429

-1840324437
"What about?"
488119074

-1840324437
"Family troubles, for one thing."
331581754

-1840324437
"But he has no family."
375522019

-1840324437
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
-1831011252
brother a few years since."
1048432919

-1840324437
"His _elder_ brother?"
490536205

-1840324437
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
1953231752
the property; only about nine years."
1670864950

-1840324437
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
-893484408
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
-756296005

-1840324437
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
-1101444207
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
-770999303
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
797766780
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
1380067551
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
-1958051481
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
-859421271
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
-1168555242
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
-1985146967
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
2076896603
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
-1807167826
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
1256709399
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
1074628463
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
1603088762
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
-1385834782
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
-492854939
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
-1483270928

-1840324437
"Why should he shun it?"
62159435

-1840324437
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
2036936418

-1840324437
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
-1240977408
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
-792151036
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
897983319
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
1811552891
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
-1416318769
subject, which I did accordingly.
1332961151

-1840324437
CHAPTER XIV
-757609608

-1840324437

-1840324437
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
1941931726
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
-310039870
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
-530848215
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
1408241976
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
-919242195
generally did not come back till late at night.
452292323

-1840324437
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
1647931189
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
-1545493561
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
1500312516
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
-2039193310
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
361516670
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
-1016609660
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
643660035
causes quite disconnected with me.
1058240089

-1840324437
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
1950565785
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
1918262179
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
941603018
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
-1193599123
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
-1915354774
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
-348245229
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
-113945509
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
-25016365
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
1392620075
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
137332386
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
-1121496083
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
50509247
She appeared to know it by instinct.
-1610355449

-1840324437
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
2083816973

-1840324437
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
-884159453
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
-1858737528
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
29176650
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
644658444
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
1148212112
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
1067642206
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
-1741551312

-1840324437
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
1701810261
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
590222233
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
-1438030514
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
658814466

-1840324437
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
-1900878195
contemplation.
2043328505

-1840324437
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
-1453616064
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
-732333623

-1840324437
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
1550462712
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
1336779754
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
-576373947
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
1460841107
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
1103483835
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
-1014931185
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
-1860760466
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
2088694587
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
-1213246952
said to be thicker than water."
995831747

-1840324437
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
915683506
knitting-basket in hand.
-16868809

-1840324437
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
-21888255
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
-1377836312
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
-1103395321
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
1220936522
performed."
-130244770

-1840324437
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
-1742047431
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
282718966
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
2134052690
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
-1840233285

-1840324437
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
-141549396
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
161608008
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
-1374913311
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
1668954046
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
-205387094
mind to do."
-809307502

-1840324437
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
1987178718
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
-254993036
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
-1754544626

-1840324437
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
-434236294
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
-600086650
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
163667887
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
-185709209
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
-173095591
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
1026305713

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
-363202366
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
1975397476
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
109071350
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
-772432914
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
1952688730
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
-1865797722
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
463699385
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
604799216
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
1315560656
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
1652142239
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
1711816542
feeling.
354596443

-1840324437
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
-289118654
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
1452991222
fastened on his physiognomy.
-1213050552

-1840324437
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
-299575932

-1840324437
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
-1249837110
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
-1943318875
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
-678214350

-1840324437
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
424708760
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
19541512
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
-451043050
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
1381472673
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
1842152663
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
-348357013
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
-476783496

-1840324437
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
-1926265861
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
-1349794528
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
-123445962
consequence, or something of that sort."
-1870120106

-1840324437
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
-1057940043
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
1720260529
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
543161247
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
1821793925
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
1841648326

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
-1485093829
repartee: it was only a blunder."
532839516

-1840324437
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
39394692
does my forehead not please you?"
2049946025

-1840324437
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
250456767
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
-1335559909
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
-533445291

-1840324437
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
-494999925

-1840324437
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
268479731
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
-1629761791

-1840324437
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
1494273208
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
-1096672601
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
2043758426
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
-1672370098
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
-1450641803
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
1665233975
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
1255003305
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
1334460499
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
1456705012
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
-1886638767
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
487629300
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
-570476760
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
763070219
me?"
2081976871

-1840324437
"Hope of what, sir?"
1685950358

-1840324437
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
-1350680002

-1840324437
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
519869060
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
271657121
capable of being re-transformed?
990909860

-1840324437
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
-2072585808
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
-1704209791
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
9712864
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
-1097405369
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
-588332453
to-night."
-675978351

-1840324437
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
1847632901
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
305370028
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
358270925
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
1148593589
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
-1884553887
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
1493905577
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
1569174904
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
554396440
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
1716675844
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
244465399
confidence.
748213114

-1840324437
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
1485876009
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
1118228742
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
-1459044521
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
-697886219
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
940081804
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
-239312047
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
835902555
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
252271462
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
2056737883
you--therefore speak."
-403276691

-1840324437
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
-1836490447
smile either.
-1946803355

-1840324437
"Speak," he urged.
1037426903

-1840324437
"What about, sir?"
926783797

-1840324437
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
-521470673
treating it entirely to yourself."
-1021348503

-1840324437
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
1547333525
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
1011176965
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
1989904830

-1840324437
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
-87499386

-1840324437
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
-101442764
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
612645281

-1840324437
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
-1493447038
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
-1255070264
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
325471271
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
-636097790
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
978174450
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
423951752
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
233667660
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
1932900971
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
915656913
rusty nail."
-1272597156

-1840324437
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
320199503
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
-549997096

-1840324437
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
115525921
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
481617686
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
1659663230

-1840324437
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
-871536160
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
-508351564
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
53480171
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
-1125563690
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
-1630644680
people in one house?"
-1205663224

-1840324437
"Do as you please, sir."
-61565023

-1840324437
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
-1764683690
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
783221346

-1840324437
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
-1842123827
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
564927890
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
-1727627011
and experience."
1761747238

-1840324437
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
217031477
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
-1700101709
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
-1611205606
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
-460407373
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
256700698

-1840324437
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
-404797894
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
-1638960023

-1840324437
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
2017990340
expression; "but speak too."
1756324999

-1840324437
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
727178654
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
986284616
their orders."
58370755

-1840324437
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
-336587607
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
-889130689
you agree to let me hector a little?"
-1852353358

-1840324437
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
-1766286422
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
1079490458
dependency, I agree heartily."
968172050

-1840324437
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
194537695
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
69488411

-1840324437
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
1787389713
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
1841353966
salary."
-797476343

-1840324437
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
-2135424740
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
884484141
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
738797565
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
-656448885
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
-1248921335
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
-316721375
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
1193062348
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
-1384366373
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
275172276
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
-1641702064
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
1665036436
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
851883985
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
-192863630
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
1498379881

-1840324437
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
-538962314
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
1256741111
as well as imagined--
211806851

-1840324437
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
-1953191084
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
87123892
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
1246793687
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
191198716
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
-1180226349
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
727278455
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
-2107341167
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
-426636212
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
1264531316
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
869316145
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
-1245219628
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
1331272303
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
1504657887

-1840324437
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
1169310265

-1840324437
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
1410499452
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
688791304
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
2009569149
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
-1624595656
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
-1218778410
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
-147952638
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
-1042992110
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
950029861
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
1834034709
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
827098394
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
1173616499
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
-571443563
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
-1785289762
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
-375344417
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
554434661
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
-115844138
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
-921096429
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
-459889770

-1840324437
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
367833347

-1840324437
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
-272642421
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
1902419014
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
-156187409
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
124668611
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
-172876738
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
-1977988648
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
871816839
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
-2131086292
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
-2087553054

-1840324437
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
-1632051554

-1840324437
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
-710545673
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
-741741754
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
-2127277428
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
-520211023
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
1215808722

-1840324437
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
-1681385861

-1840324437
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
-457603232
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
402215448
moor."
631970873

-1840324437
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
-863165327

-1840324437
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
-125955339
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
464447973
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
53464985
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
2103844609
unacquainted with its mysteries."
1163651502

-1840324437
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
-1605299632
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
-1381724016

-1840324437
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
-1718223013
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
-1440525297
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
1596374134
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
484611868
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
-1174013732
when it asks entrance to my heart."
-1994348306

-1840324437
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
-597729665

-1840324437
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
525811826
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
1032634097
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
1944638708

-1840324437
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
1159308077
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
-555672254
misery if you listen to it."
293928487

-1840324437
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
477946827
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
-633248409
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
952505957

-1840324437
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
777876851
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
1800932396
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
414992776

-1840324437
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
1842725142
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
2126864626
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
-1624286115

-1840324437
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
409584469
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
-1886746005
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
425154071
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
-1804996056
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
526584165
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
-907762103
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
-1688633188
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
-770516723
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
-1965711726
which you might revert with pleasure."
-1819513778

-1840324437
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
1832356828
paving hell with energy."
172941656

-1840324437
"Sir?"
-237475588

-1840324437
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
-1982506945
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
279265643
been."
-1339295427

-1840324437
"And better?"
1179890936

-1840324437
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
-997467888
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
-849872050
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
1885818505
and Persians, that both are right."
2004505208

-1840324437
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
-1331000258

-1840324437
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
-474494864
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
-1850434150

-1840324437
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
564469784
is liable to abuse."
-2119023413

-1840324437
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
-687266512
abuse it."
494489979

-1840324437
"You are human and fallible."
-1268864447

-1840324437
"I am: so are you--what then?"
450824702

-1840324437
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
-2013756771
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
-1398166455

-1840324437
"What power?"
-1800536033

-1840324437
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
861274434
right.'"
1439060222

-1840324437
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
38917763

-1840324437
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
875347519
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
-1455648848
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
-650270156
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
-303398676
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
1364335434

-1840324437
"Where are you going?"
-692143222

-1840324437
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
2016214617

-1840324437
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
-65485422

-1840324437
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
1056223844
certainly not afraid."
-1952154795

-1840324437
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
1380569936

-1840324437
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
475224907

-1840324437
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
-1135703878
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
-1552368970
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
1754343179
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
-1399522714
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
-199455718
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
566627815
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
-43054926
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
698773771
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
2090552388
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
758256132
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
-1256839091
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
641511598
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
-1015504456
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
-773740692

-1840324437
"It has struck nine, sir."
-1729549526

-1840324437
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
-1055328523
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
-1181502176
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
1508160970
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
348791439
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
1096172354
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
1277952584
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
560638994
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
-555551153
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
1620678601
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
1450549482
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
1949412031
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
716595410
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
-1896015777
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
804775558
will be realised."
1876598576

-1840324437
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
-53311971
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
930903387
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
-12708818
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
-1618572563
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
-407015472
and small white satin sandals.
-336251197

-1840324437
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
-337951039
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
1344810017

-1840324437
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
1898972816
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
-174833733
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
-8071841

-1840324437
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
-1658657084
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
-765656653

-1840324437
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
417433945
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
-238461477
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
-1784167613
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
1008737776
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
1982809104
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
-58340924
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
-658450878
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
1008206914
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
-549689895
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
496440380
Good-night."
1931934718

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XV
1655063520

-1840324437

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
-32005340
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
-1579610625
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
774097625
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
-575535443

-1840324437
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
280400764
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
-884878719
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
-879737411
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
276602832
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
518658120
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
-1782827883

-1840324437
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
-1931498227
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
1671301034
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
-35292135
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
-796011068
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
1439445392
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
1692927907
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
-701980450
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
-349056676
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
-152713704
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
2000237440
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
129340578
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
-1975958185
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
2112448855
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
436011501
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
668449609
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
967326314
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
1491237283
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
-904664566
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
-1984390869
now, if you will excuse me."
1168938089

-1840324437
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
-1600711897
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
14090531
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
1517336078

-1840324437
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
2067337525
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
499473210
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
-1916893280
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
990509745
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
1232108712
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
-1280842392
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
932075950
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
-717687448
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
-750154665
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
-2012119833
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
928350747
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
573885904
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
-1514923671
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
1684851031
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
-911782578
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
-1376436041
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
597728399
cochere_ of the hotel.
1706246512

-1840324437
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
1531446184
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
-1141845105
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
459089416
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
2091865363
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
1144231522
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
640139272
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
1483500349
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
1068293284
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
996993263
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
997697494
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
-350553705
current--as I am now.
1149932161

-1840324437
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
1358585740
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
801328784
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
-1347358989
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
1799565047
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
-1733357945
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
-171167215

-1840324437
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
95874728
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
-1530326676
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
1444829212

-1840324437
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
-1519858712
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
-1812883972
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
2041947486
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
2049457020
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
1458027682
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
-267390946
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
-848474950
his countenance: he went on--
-194537196

-1840324437
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
825049664
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
1098795940
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
-1808051331
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
1138632296
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
-1563251720
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
-1033799286
if you dare!'
-1474095269

-1840324437
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
-2050233153
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
-251364752
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
504101964
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
-1769699366
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
-147883400
but straw and rotten wood."
1198199715

-1840324437
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
-605400389
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
87440425
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
1201696749
whence he had abruptly diverged--
-1181915292

-1840324437
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
1555207166

-1840324437
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
285147017
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
-660212276
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
-899554941
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
-425152930
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
1527498319
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
-2050227006
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
2118053760
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
1957112227
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
1329984733
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
-1851051125
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
1567088436
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
-1355107368
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
1371243321
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
-318383547
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
-879571698
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
-473557363
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
1877190502
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
1166953233
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
651194796
After this digression he proceeded--
-1753354572

-1840324437
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
-292405588
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
-1275372932
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
-264754809
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
763410493
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
-47954940
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
471837573
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
-2062982650
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
-297280142
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
-930026705
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
1120451719
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
-2031283693
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
218999361
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
-1995099085
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
-1234744032
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
343118762
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
-494557730
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
1944155629
who had been her dupe.
-966932963

-1840324437
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
-635155448
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
-160694122
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
-1281740660
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
1201483449
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
-1294488767
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
-2121609520
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
16166535
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
1126712503
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
1382319314
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
326896862
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
-1393917844

-1840324437
Adele here came running up again.
-154968583

-1840324437
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
1293411375
wishes to see you."
-1204047954

-1840324437
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
1631584847
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
-1763398032
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
-94212060
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
-161813193
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
-1589374425
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
-418156642
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
1835864846
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
-822071490
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
1844790107
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
1977485555
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
-119168833
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
-487115397
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
-1325836897
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
-1421956182
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
1291322835
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
782174715
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
-1280435429
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
-874758837
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
-1041574995
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
1681807855
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
645365581
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
888304029

-1840324437
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
1463694273
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
-1659739116
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
-1578739397
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
2034918650
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
1929561161
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
1954507008

-1840324437
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
-1847414627
you too: it darkens."
-37178949

-1840324437
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
-711505174
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
524648796
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
330090268
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
129585351
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
-1416547013
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
-1265476121
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
1872659920
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
381064515
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
4398291
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
24957468
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
-1776130252
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
-771728585

-1840324437
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
-440053561
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
-1335048278
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
-760854109
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
159036785
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
1865438609
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
1671627416
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
1429320181
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
1318350038
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
-251557071
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
-930486064
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
-2060075767
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
2329406
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
-792365524
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
-116631978
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
1742137654
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
-1609061375
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
1010792670
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
1894835980
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
870629600
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
-540669258
benefit.
-188945985

-1840324437
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
1631103220
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
-12857243
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
-1622610349
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
-1054633289
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
-1924690437
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
-1356124348
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
2110923746
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
1127912000
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
-175707612

-1840324437
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
-1047380405
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
595455381
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
2049244278
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
-456214706
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
1603019668
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
1052868280
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
-20019670
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
-1363059286

-1840324437
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
-2106067222
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
136250623
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
1439725187
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
-428848947
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
-1370207868
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
647936066
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
1462725559
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
1305992054
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
1471790842
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
733981569
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
-159048044
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
1369480337
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
-295914687
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
-374654037
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
-370354662
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
90455917
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
-2111069978
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
-1835150932
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
903854260

-1840324437
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
1665107386
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
674576015
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
627779406
Thornfield.
950286166

-1840324437
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
767512452
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
2065556340
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
497045600
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
-1912025804
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
1374531504

-1840324437
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
180997765
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
-826151350
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
-1429570217
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
1169517295
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
187042567

-1840324437
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
-1874412659
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
1947720285
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
178157875
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
86486280
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
-1176269814

-1840324437
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
-708131830
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
-2076137635
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
274285392
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
-361945339
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
1261932466
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
-1681621948
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
-717207353
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
1233073439
enough.
1429883754

-1840324437
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
547035746
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
-1939461660
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
1185632239
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
1729403331
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
-85240297
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
146051542
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
-347446550
there?"
-1229394892

-1840324437
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
-1618470626
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
987331486
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
1569769202

-1840324437
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
-245872204
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
420379788
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
-454915150
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
-214932129
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
-1231944167
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
667269835
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
-663262011
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
1014495800
burning.
1421139401

-1840324437
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
-2081391133
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
-1773039529
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
677715048
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
864390012
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
965054086
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
695780227

-1840324437
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
-156309835
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
-1358532670
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
-1027432451
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
832577454
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
2074045097
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
749540426
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
894395916

-1840324437
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
472768644
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
-913221731
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
-2088575731
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
-1174258469
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
-260626052
water.
347887500

-1840324437
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
407713882

-1840324437
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
-578386139
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
-2014091057

-1840324437
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
-431614714
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
-784949858
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
-862438129

-1840324437
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
1498770778
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
38818743

-1840324437
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
557056123
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
-2010500938
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
-855402295

-1840324437
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
275437135
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
-360820890
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
-461703688

-1840324437
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
672594641
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
-543337214
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
-1082468689
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
1180226190
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
-178484769

-1840324437
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
-292325822

-1840324437
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
-987571535
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
779811698

-1840324437
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
1799489601

-1840324437
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
-12336525
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
880123298

-1840324437
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
-639796574

-1840324437
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
-1532801389
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
445570661
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
1161046068
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
974272137
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
-1609607907
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
1955057371
move, remember, or call any one."
-1574535911

-1840324437
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
1487879112
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
129683041
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
1106766841
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
-1154888333
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
1237038292
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
-934312568
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
1764056832
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
-339497468
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
-790262590
"and not something worse."
206463296

-1840324437
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
942221909
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
-1140131694

-1840324437
"How, sir?"
-283874636

-1840324437
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
340182410
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
-983585738

-1840324437
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
-981355300
door."
-1025558422

-1840324437
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
2022593652

-1840324437
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
915046170
think, or something like it?"
1904096875

-1840324437
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
617371978
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
811531540

-1840324437
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
-779830196
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
1854637128
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
1372191565
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
406545317
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
-722412420
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
-944668083
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
1019668107
hours the servants will be up."
-1658208659

-1840324437
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
-2030044063

-1840324437
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
1218046244
go.
-1059690755

-1840324437
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
-171061738

-1840324437
"You said I might go, sir."
588280596

-1840324437
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
987524928
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
-1041761693
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
1205325897
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
1251526024
At least shake hands."
600820650

-1840324437
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
-424057906
both his own.
-721769921

-1840324437
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
2032108675
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
1850511215
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
-12818130
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
379877272

-1840324437
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
1367880075
his voice was checked.
1273220865

-1840324437
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
-1554923075
in the case."
638758095

-1840324437
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
1865367450
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
540922069
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
-291487046
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
-1430907650
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
460244557
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
-322042352

-1840324437
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
-1915855358

-1840324437
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
1171352816

-1840324437
"What! you _will_ go?"
1630656681

-1840324437
"I am cold, sir."
-1120032378

-1840324437
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
1449579297
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
-1804187360
expedient.
-1801465909

-1840324437
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
821383036

-1840324437
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
-1521987479

-1840324437
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
424417782
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
1009524281
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
-986502731
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
1259180153
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
1273386569
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
1126040147
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
290486611
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
-922208251

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XVI
1845021873

-1840324437

-1840324437
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
-726664512
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
808247104
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
1005540730
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
-1054499934
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
-1185846411
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
1424444257

-1840324437
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
1649610735
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
1347078097
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
717456553
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
713084812
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
296150921
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
-2023079971
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
-558907740
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
-1251122841
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
-987280205

-1840324437
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
2122507616
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
-354248629
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
741026767
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
531106784
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
-1793400099
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
-1041728562
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
1329563310
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
1926200651
no other than Grace Poole.
211899312

-1840324437
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
2118239691
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
2118015905
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
1115311929
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
-100810249
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
1332732055
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
8496134
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
-454014451
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
289718436
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
-431991651
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
2070876711
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
1550091308
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
2026336938
went on with her sewing.
-284323723

-1840324437
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
-961303534
is past comprehension."
329713420

-1840324437
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
985607032
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
-1406147733

-1840324437
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
278147944
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
-1356761761
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
1934670757
the flames with the water in the ewer."
29908089

-1840324437
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
-1468568401
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
-503442084

-1840324437
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
1903085458
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
-790059831
she answered--
-1346265187

-1840324437
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
961659512
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
-973838283
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
1024040815
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
-1406001476
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
1906396601
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
2008211894
a noise?"
-1193381956

-1840324437
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
590846648
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
-1928552030
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
871427303

-1840324437
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
1999715601
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
1469718234

-1840324437
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
809646146
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
-22736450

-1840324437
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
-1222008842
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
521338680
conscious eye.
-941521152

-1840324437
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
-2024392555

-1840324437
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
988676253

-1840324437
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
-1279585057
gallery?" she further asked.
-688839347

-1840324437
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
1331079317
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
-1364378463
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
-192571456
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
1750424897

-1840324437
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
170061219

-1840324437
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
448120773
you get into bed?"
-1030862102

-1840324437
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
-968020616
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
1620887990
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
1272864885
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
-2110583883
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
-1726420486
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
1165205068
lie down."
842961403

-1840324437
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
-955961276
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
321571801
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
1397043433
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
-1570576403
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
-1220585731
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
1868506188
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
305935961
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
-937707049
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
510841459
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
-649618518
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
-1764375102
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
-1523186802
demureness of a Quakeress.
1175216071

-1840324437
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
-1685242581
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
1077720525
entered.
379795275

-1840324437
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
910616859
be ready: will you come down?"
577532439

-1840324437
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
811615247
carry it upstairs."
431606206

-1840324437
"You'll have some meat?"
-759540587

-1840324437
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
1586749847

-1840324437
"And the sago?"
1569391509

-1840324437
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
-738776229
make it myself."
1616573270

-1840324437
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
587674483
so I departed.
-253231735

-1840324437
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
-1445263948
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
-866008364
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
-859958706
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
-1049460355
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
-1618013346
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
-544854686
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
117725225
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
-2105785814
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
406059943
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
-939323545
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
628672371
attempt, much less punish her for it.
1495249214

-1840324437
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
1404981226
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
504236907
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
-248468027
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
1312016419
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
-1669312402
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
-1284340853
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
93099708
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
-228542621
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
-58483535
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
-1854798182
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
-135373208
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
-1227582301
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
1922468920
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
-356764494
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
-1133713511
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
-86104474
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
-137076274
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
-400180135
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
-1476745115
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
-1487351249

-1840324437
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
-274280138
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
-1593254314
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
1261036870

-1840324437
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
1929733873
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
504922428

-1840324437
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
-41246601
thinking.
1396834030

-1840324437
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
-2121410280
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
-1382858369
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
-740234088
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
-773521032
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
689761467
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
-2040028490

-1840324437
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
1691341151
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
-471927868
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
-1459682939
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
-312335655
impatient."
601906288

-1840324437
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
450166171
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
-1633206561
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
-232453805
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
877556535
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
1958934933
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
667141548
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
592881262
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
23429848
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
1460468977
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
588050984
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
-588294052
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
-131848466
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
-2131176220
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
16799371
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
-1539654636
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
-1755558341
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
-952215640
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
1289379783
restraint; this suited both him and me.
-1783059006

-1840324437
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
684497664
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
793116126
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
-1792643789
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
-2137280522

-1840324437
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
95859224
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
-49428728
day: you look flushed and feverish."
-97533353

-1840324437
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
1646158612

-1840324437
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
98065747
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
-697622075
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
-831800169
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
388256430
deepening into total obscurity.
361921003

-1840324437
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
-1060477596
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
2142688198
his journey."
961674352

-1840324437
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
546379891

-1840324437
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
51139294
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
-754501055
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
-1719442869
Colonel Dent, and others."
508432093

-1840324437
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
1904763347

-1840324437
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
1085749190
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
-2107167714
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
698614999
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
773658790
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
-580290717
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
-601919500
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
604397808
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
29974317
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
1422217337
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
-854656744

-1840324437
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
-359610366

-1840324437
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
1640812339
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
-161427477
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
469636971
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
-1692209019
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
1154044086
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
-1421779221
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
208422053
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
1186536590
the evening."
-1969506827

-1840324437
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
1511436315

-1840324437
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
-21885723
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
-544176325
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
1332444220
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
392967184
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
-1961414891
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
449778620
was certainly the queen."
2082351968

-1840324437
"And what was she like?"
-2000019335

-1840324437
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
566318665
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
-703395782
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
-38222886
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
308608540
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
11582804
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
-1143444300
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
1716405718
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
956031964
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
1236301756
jetty mass of her curls."
-760656761

-1840324437
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
1521251334

-1840324437
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
352643957
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
-1513763154
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
1158490772

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
-2121130707

-1840324437
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
-1793763898

-1840324437
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
1059597821

-1840324437
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
1859369505
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
-587918607
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
604434141

-1840324437
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
-1553330262

-1840324437
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
-1825487550
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
1425245536
eldest son came in for everything almost."
1174036247

-1840324437
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
805122071
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
1700739542

-1840324437
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
-319324710
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
-876718898

-1840324437
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
525868789

-1840324437
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
-1797341834
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
-740866671
began tea."
-391614641

-1840324437
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
-238317048

-1840324437
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
1778715971
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
-458585323
conversation was turned into another channel.
-1789826245

-1840324437
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
-2020132721
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
1124560707
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
-534833297
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
1965716064

-1840324437
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
577682988
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
-1441913255
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
-709767031
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
-416723655
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
595242161
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
246858149

-1840324437
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
309431776
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
1410215864
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
388465894

-1840324437
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
-1900015009
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
-91332507
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
-2015737700
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
-446619236
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
-97604476
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
-1701881581
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
1865344352
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
1851546870
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
-580373538
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
-912262262
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
-1600306284
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
2081377269
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
998844890
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
2000481964
is no extrication.
705263678

-1840324437
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
775379630
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
-114126378
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
564469486
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
1276557556
poor, and plain.'
-722084521

-1840324437
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
-1212090187
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
-82101986
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
-142123647
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
-333425464
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
-2073705635
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
893662828
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
-1894739497
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
317929616
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
1211418582
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
2032470810
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
-1989820483
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
1482885874
accomplished lady of rank.'
-322350869

-1840324437
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
1397823183
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
276488698
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
409403845
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
2017964497
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
-926230872

-1840324437
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
2091990361
calm, and fell asleep.
245774434

-1840324437
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
-2075952572
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
1625743079
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
-1215139154
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
418248324
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
139378557
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
560842955
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
1640603069

-1840324437
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
-1264011645
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
591997111
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
-374782386
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
1175738927
maintain, even externally.
-726130635

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XVII
-937217260

-1840324437

-1840324437
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
1184253123
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
1443829902
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
-1152722996
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
-660250797
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
445412616
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
892111214
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
-462716590
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
-1920941636
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
-845137047
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
-506878551
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
1768013388
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
1908468106
on the contrary, I just said--
-1999864785

-1840324437
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
1342842905
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
2107977463
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
-317000948
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
-1044161203
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
1721035929
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
-959851462
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
904140584
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
1024927481
wanted and would be despised."
-972708983

-1840324437
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
-1198559310
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
1927890627
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
1329437090
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
503616563
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
-611078437

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
270768677
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
244474383

-1840324437
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
805144803
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
-653144104

-1840324437
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
920883458
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
1181560849
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
1712952225
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
1922099492
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
-484473675

-1840324437
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
197982399
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
-2013823161
holding the note before her spectacles.
1270339142

-1840324437
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
452995336
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
1418400319
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
894529735

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
1111141585

-1840324437
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
1087179955
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
-555560097
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
-2104375656
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
2051577133
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
-1356908173
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
1794371224
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
601462277
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
2029720647

-1840324437
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
-1969142702
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
1364009199
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
-1242065794
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
1006327433
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
-1775844281
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
-1099576010
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
1709334806
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
-1816885027
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
-1356790444
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
1724420387
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
-1854704482
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
-1352201430
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
1113674623
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
-459357064
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
1762017140
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
1563253615
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
-359912348
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
1959909476

-1840324437
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
348904843
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
-160428499
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
941577677
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
-920584183
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
41017261
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
-2069998320
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
1736036297
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
-169176139
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
-1645666158
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
-1078191410
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
184658923
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
1773540031
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
1260898641
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
-1789473314
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
361645356
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
-2033337477
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
1145727419
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
1757291244
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
-842569933
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
-637472907

-1840324437
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
1571212441
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
1645357447
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
723378231
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
1094780823
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
-1383173356
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
1688394898

-1840324437
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
1366811680

-1840324437
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
-1557269488
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
1443489357
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
-920172211
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
-1028195606
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
-814578672
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
-929735719
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
1384967919

-1840324437
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
-525080118

-1840324437
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
1243439192
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
-735896348
the money she gets."
-1765724265

-1840324437
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
-253834399

-1840324437
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
1229316272
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
250982732

-1840324437
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
1056860925

-1840324437
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
294042657
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
-1265737486
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
802849076
excluded.
691673188

-1840324437
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
-1843621476
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
1637727078
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
-460367904
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
1594909219
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
1627152838
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
-1042921345
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
636574743
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
1242246718
sides.
2038747250

-1840324437
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
1254763052
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
474792829
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
471969533
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
-115187795
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
1787764483
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
-263982456
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
1616403001
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
-1778902222
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
691429230

-1840324437
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
-1742871200
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
1201254264
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
1932782800
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
-631905995

-1840324437
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
570752631
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
2121909138
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
-1375594696
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
381388251
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
1676691703
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
274104715

-1840324437
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
1551931609
minutes."
448400142

-1840324437
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
1996262117
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
-1551384474

-1840324437
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
-1314203255
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
1884988037
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
1978728815
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
-780097789
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
1744316569
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
-864773546
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
1505622101
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
-2093685609
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
1787198529

-1840324437
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
-1222403197
below.
1058154079

-1840324437
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
49957325
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
1215871492
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
1791881322
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
-429394381
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
582723252
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
1143063632
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
809470329

-1840324437
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
-1280675237
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
2099264561
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
1949476510
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
642683805
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
-922293528
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
-2065704132
and, for a time, a hush.
-146944333

-1840324437
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
2007569862
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
-1601402945

-1840324437
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
-1717224584
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
365229712
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
1813991895
on apprend."
-1444917791

-1840324437
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
124326693

-1840324437
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
-1123929246
mange."
-787791577

-1840324437
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
-501380130
get you something to eat."
649623686

-1840324437
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
-1818583586
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
1279044657
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
-1260764534
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
-520327406
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
13874022
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
-1879132950
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
-1262916406
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
308355503
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
999151579
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
1773322161
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
1660159470
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
1992775598
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
1893103220
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
-514237666
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
906070729
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
465233408
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
-693584115

-1840324437
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
-1350638
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
358815276
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
503032112
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
-1347087598
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
1365414100
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
-1175562654
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
-1229371332

-1840324437
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
845867353
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
536338882
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
109281254
dinner?"
-659637978

-1840324437
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
-1207744707
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
-1883001077
is your dinner."
41448444

-1840324437
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
-1049152504
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
1332563700
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
1158347803
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
1987810512
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
-1388467306
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
1453536532
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
1846998932
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
-1848184539
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
-1763708266
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
1115565278
quel dommage!"
971413249

-1840324437
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
187136157
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
1111454937
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
-1867180679
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
-842782277
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
1605481639
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
-166421755
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
22403963
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
555690805
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
99303800
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
-1809060615
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
-1992882430
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
504548389
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
1457089874
by distance inarticulate, into words.
-451267470

-1840324437
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
-1257851352
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
-1651805835
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
1677110896
sought their chambers.
-1122295364

-1840324437
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
-2070610600
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
-482293317
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
-675913653
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
2034732463
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
1851761730
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
247234409
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
-1132757579

-1840324437
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
-949104441
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
1943514498
ladies."
694153770

-1840324437
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
-196665025

-1840324437
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
125235248
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
-1427287608
never had a glimpse of it yet."
-91465868

-1840324437
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
-755663745
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
416860532
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
617032899
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
562949423

-1840324437
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
963173140
answered.
-1318817467

-1840324437
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
904557059
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
-1630700385
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
-996781782
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
-1191155558
case of contumacy.'"
1444290808

-1840324437
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
1430357488
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
53881514

-1840324437
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
20826527
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
-1781707689
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
1543021127
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
-1548692246
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
1540935264
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
1894912748
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
-31747474

-1840324437
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
-1906031205

-1840324437
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
1013074410
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
-1551784103
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
1769342998
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
-1580329906
stay at Thornfield."
2025716922

-1840324437
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
365982273
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
1831233125
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
-1699488878
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
647988301
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
35547129
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
-615996504
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
-382914254
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
1250164979
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
166046871
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
-774141535
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
382191412
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
-2035397766
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
1147626938
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
-600245376
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
449618206
descended.
2078987027

-1840324437
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
1169982069
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
-676345411
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
452228606
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
1239385190
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
-1865541762
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
-1672350878
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
-745138171
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
985590730

-1840324437
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
1528669418
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
-91304842
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
1289024939
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
-987570124
touched my knee.
643356932

-1840324437
"What is it, Adele?"
-361414464

-1840324437
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
1984603452
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
-938571672

-1840324437
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
46396386
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
2074722676
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
-1712489871
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
-56828068
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
1432774470
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
612380539

-1840324437
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
125565873
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
-944200561
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
-650590021
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
1562812330
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
-666690838

-1840324437
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
-633387250
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
-237542768
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
-1586293151
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
329203133
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
851950702
stared at me.
372523518

-1840324437
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
1124407672
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
1871393600
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
858804623
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
-789810425
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
674126
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
-656701410
and may as well mention them now.
-715199531

-1840324437
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
-992220940
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
1273346277
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
-1465412916
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
1066895824
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
-576934992
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
-329444789
both sisters were fair as lilies.
1361166819

-1840324437
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
693125448
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
-1738272340
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
624885205
within the circlet of a band of gems.
1071158281

-1840324437
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
-893937384
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
1781857059
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
973039801
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
1917477050

-1840324437
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
-752664606
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
1676280415
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
-896182615
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
-1474024053
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
-424864321
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
226993317
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
739946662
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
209269459
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
447719242
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
1863553664
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
-931609457
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
-1580516221
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
1267541068
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
219155151
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
-1381618563
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
-784082253
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
1037894535
truly imperial dignity.
-1238203083

-1840324437
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
-593771102
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
-64924077
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
-806414401
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
-606143454
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
-1084485957
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
-2071050260
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
159364718

-1840324437
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
371260055
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
318269263
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
1114609647
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
-303071584
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
-124943265
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
434597110
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
631524333
haughty lip.
-743153055

-1840324437
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
634297284
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
2044053333
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
-1528800655
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
1185580513
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
-1843413162
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
-992107841
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
1286437908
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
1301476990
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
-272114507
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
-170535565
with fluency and with a good accent.
113770811

-1840324437
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
-23208889
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
-479589559
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
379928201
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
-814311094
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
9317839
in spotless white.
-1300304509

-1840324437
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
-2140770217
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
1978412415
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
1226293862
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
-47999924
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
1058079548
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
814362178
together.
686934114

-1840324437
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
-1782829242
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
-3366028
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
726513003
gravity--
-737499302

-1840324437
"Bon jour, mesdames."
-603359641

-1840324437
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
-950592050
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
-1636820490

-1840324437
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
-1981071152
little French girl he was speaking of."
-628025289

-1840324437
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
1844601645

-1840324437
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
-1948814655
child!"
626907422

-1840324437
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
-487828519
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
1465697105
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
1442047581
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
689968597

-1840324437
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
-241337994
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
-1325488338
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
572192830
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
-865895502
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
468546721
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
1965648973
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
1698707981
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
248065589
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
-10335306
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
2022676917
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
-1995408251
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
444708433
blood or vigour of brain.
2141104810

-1840324437
And where is Mr. Rochester?
-440808347

-1840324437
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
2113146725
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
-1006238553
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
1172814985
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
-1103117547
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
-1778167842
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
-1246928535
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
1494397977
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
-138554663
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
-534793285
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
530172584
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
-71712559
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
1909542835
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
1067891455
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
1707329870

-1840324437
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
1931640364
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
1017764913
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
-1697735950
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
2010262818
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
783015454
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
931175638
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
-455720762
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
786548908

-1840324437
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
75710895
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
1453000934
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
371169188
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
807800274
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
1681109775
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
-995441561
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
2145665852
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
-911078401
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
2029220662
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
-553469507

-1840324437
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
-1042797865
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
1966460588
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
1706758749
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
-55298923
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
-613652961
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
-14126831
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
-1930136874
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
1361467290
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
-308354654
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
1434017647
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
-1772181456
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
484536079
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
1342818287
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
1079061101
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
957294499
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
-88314535
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
-812063172
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
-1105033764
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
437979098
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
1031200687
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
-468029195
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
64522885
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
1457748989
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
-371633390
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
-148188193
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
-760307090
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
-2026358661
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
1919242297
breathe and think, I must love him."
2058739777

-1840324437
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
979478088
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
-608084245
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
400738301
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
439006596
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
426628741
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
1467392563
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
2050491362
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
2119562671
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
-585897951
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
1605955072
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
1726932881
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
-595541761
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
-163315079
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
-1825438040
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
-1139493272
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
1388137452
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
-2134818622
selects a mate.
-1999404008

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
-975328033
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
-1954421817
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
885237824

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
-1679354828

-1840324437
"Nor am I."
-1042714141

-1840324437
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
1824113866
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
1578375336

-1840324437
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
-2088267056

-1840324437
"You should have sent her to school."
987057770

-1840324437
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
617702387

-1840324437
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
1007591356
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
897551331
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
-264083727
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
-1591345302

-1840324437
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
-1286448747
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
-2021338555
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
316612541

-1840324437
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
-1518018491
straight before him.
-1042880082

-1840324437
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
-1575333096
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
859145050
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
1182838377
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
389847401

-1840324437
"Did you speak, my own?"
1296190211

-1840324437
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
-1807850032
her question with an explanation.
-219182700

-1840324437
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
-1373669844
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
-1648024698
Heaven I have now done with them!"
-245164890

-1840324437
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
-1424934825
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
-1017060532
the anathematised race was present.
-670975133

-1840324437
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
549935739
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
334662328
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
1249362896

-1840324437
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
1933389074

-1840324437
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
-2103687522
three times with portentous significancy.
617136053

-1840324437
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
-946587909

-1840324437
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
-559061985

-1840324437
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
-654302978
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
-1103175822
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
-1345696709
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
348585358
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
1904476466
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
-489856168
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
603372834
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
-1599813311
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
-632543687
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
-102291629
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
2008163322
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
406013855

-1840324437
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
1673062495
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
-2071764668
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
-2102637100
when she was herself so ignorant."
1665374747

-1840324437
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
-1310456680
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
539468318
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
584735562
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
710122353
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
-799415996
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
-1382962116
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
-1114585076
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
-1354380334
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
-30248408
lady-mother?"
1428996326

-1840324437
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
-960821042
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
918694024
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
1055605912

-1840324437
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
-1898428026
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
-13028591
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
1997442071
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
464860770
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
753420764

-1840324437
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
1664714613

-1840324437
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
-2004619653

-1840324437
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
645235989
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
1679817242
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
-1563162399
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
1683486626

-1840324437
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
-240078138
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
-147878774
she would give us anything we asked for."
415043203

-1840324437
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
114920926
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
-1242503251
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
-592497271
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
-209237795

-1840324437
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
-1889808057

-1840324437
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
1701510785
in voice to-night?"
727104954

-1840324437
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
-1099626197

-1840324437
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
-103033597
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
668472809

-1840324437
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
603182454

-1840324437
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
-1236581732
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
1771920451
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
-844438984
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
-823988579
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
-589894952
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
-1920754222
hand."
-107080765

-1840324437
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
846030610
Mr. Rochester.
-1285059857

-1840324437
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
1725848247

-1840324437
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
-736397459

-1840324437
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
-791825290
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
-288429440
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
-495553849
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
1339030062
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
1405813101
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
-1766352308

-1840324437
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
-1220215680
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
2041580452
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
677929087
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
-2107627391
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
-611922823
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
227607538
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
1142995903
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
1622667989
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
-356382326
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
152096782
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
-199506926

-1840324437
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
-2140436352
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
823951597
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
-1250297449
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
-1956179374
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
1677535822

-1840324437
"I am all obedience," was the response.
280513170

-1840324437
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
510197226
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
1052553142

-1840324437
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
-2040356894
water."
-1614115770

-1840324437
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
1019651572
such things _should_ be done."
127447140

-1840324437
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
-435190775
fail."
-2002016944

-1840324437
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
-792718397
proportionate punishment."
-1619891294

-1840324437
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
742683297
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
-1715254055

-1840324437
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
-1423429741

-1840324437
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
1412975123
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
-1536508567
capital punishment."
1687758207

-1840324437
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
275435549
accompaniment in spirited style.
1474350046

-1840324437
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
-1452294715
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
1696598086
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
-1397818259
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
-272921773
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
182579517
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
-494587614
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
1171042897
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
1523808507
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
1690773797
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
972708219
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
433248974
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
-347479372

-1840324437
"How do you do?" he asked.
-1726999924

-1840324437
"I am very well, sir."
121805556

-1840324437
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
-1212983194

-1840324437
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
-1541169605
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
-1796264329

-1840324437
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
-867221993

-1840324437
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
-1614618501

-1840324437
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
446187707

-1840324437
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
-57987922
What is the matter?"
941096656

-1840324437
"Nothing at all, sir."
316115636

-1840324437
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
1050887288

-1840324437
"Not the least."
851654677

-1840324437
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
538979

-1840324437
"I am tired, sir."
-188375469

-1840324437
He looked at me for a minute.
-193106609

-1840324437
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
-904983062

-1840324437
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
478956842

-1840324437
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
-155482302
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
-805411612
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
1860903696
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
-314659905
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
-1304701031
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
1555554786
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
233454074
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
-189525443
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
-803790423

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XVIII
-1855904610

-1840324437

-1840324437
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
1620311908
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
-137578041
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
307725944
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
1225307895
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
585631864
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
1916311738
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
-1233017557

-1840324437
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
-1135042172
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
-908321277
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
1648007618
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
324447252
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
-1518955941
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
-355651843
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
1672481294

-1840324437
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
-1455378146
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
1862736378
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
385957131
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
-755477147
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
-294630502
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
587364590
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
628421142
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
-1930521521
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
-1132763971
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
682625019
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
-613913981
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
785200006
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
-2099067776
drawing-room.
455991563

-1840324437
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
-1070712027
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
1061569654
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
1521545264
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
-1217528149
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
-1895199239

-1840324437
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
-1530910105
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
110601792
usual seat.
1558024494

-1840324437
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
1366018916
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
251512595
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
-193409358
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
2136652885

-1840324437
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
1399908780

-1840324437
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
-930141844
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
2013211705
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
-1533593816
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
904796070
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
-379593665
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
-1000377557
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
1874049592
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
-1430590827
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
2083313485
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
2081028589
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
27959076
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
-336221196
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
-599018879
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
-2106083596
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
400187802

-1840324437
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
-1485808110

-1840324437
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
-961674630
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
1629873252
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
1352857110
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
1478832169
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
977547970
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
290555601
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
-1133915653
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
-593067770

-1840324437
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
863238477
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
938897120
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
810569055
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
-2083462027
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
-565135745
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
-2099552312
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
603300312
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
-2143718492
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
-1933711429
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
-44376637
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
-1515635581
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
236987464

-1840324437
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
-407012336
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
-72338742
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
-1067347108
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
-1100340365
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
520659772
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
-88687378
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
-66699141
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
-1924470557
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
1587665608
wanting.
2458066

-1840324437
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
28750780
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
-1566948159
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
1382417059
curtain again descended.
-183390688

-1840324437
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
570118316
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
365447753
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
-1944082314
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
-996864248
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
-17073163

-1840324437
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
62709354
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
1175496412
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
2023177759
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
-289802866
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
171161900
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
1384072341
attached fetters.
31776961

-1840324437
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
-342065273

-1840324437
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
1945323036
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
-1046476946
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
-529466906

-1840324437
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
490941757
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
982178245
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
766294751

-1840324437
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
1733690296

-1840324437
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
-262132644
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
-2022804137

-1840324437
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
1252853998

-1840324437
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
2016502550
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
1029388131

-1840324437
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
-1120718766
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
-840498207
colour rose.
593730552

-1840324437
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
-1536585123
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
1225554141
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
-1647930817
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
-967921836
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
-370365173
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
-1175011895
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
999983211
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
-877235732
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
-1225331670
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
-1574702336
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
-1465822057
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
1903869003
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
-904609540
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
-1803034775
returns in memory at this moment.
312961301

-1840324437
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
-1370581223
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
1656049366
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
217283493
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
847465623
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
-128071108
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
574730120
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
-1618076833
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
1330759223
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
-1599334900
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
390141561
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
-602436392
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
-1426348259
very pride, irresistible.
1355149015

-1840324437
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
931585636
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
-1894279795
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
-1815501592
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
175650459
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
2127493034
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
-1444079339
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
1942230281
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
797370484
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
156919976
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
-2000933329
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
-1904758271
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
-1425210986
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
79908331
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
1709110708
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
474974916
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
882687042
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
-836894136
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
-414668227
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
-513668625
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
1329770653
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
884537716
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
-959055191
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
109253958
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
1587281363
torturing pain arose.
-941310826

-1840324437
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
-126554053
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
-1023190444
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
1345390736
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
1681071941
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
-2099143028
not charm him_.
-404240981

-1840324437
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
-1899170502
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
178418281
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
-112262257
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
-2122361815
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
-632192797
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
164231848
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
-906502754
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
-1186567282
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
902300459
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
368719388
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
-753877056
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
-540164769
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
1805182932
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
492523898
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
238507241

-1840324437
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
-1157514901
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
-295707002
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
-430922466
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
-2046358566
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
-255617813
silent conquest might have been won.
251807048

-1840324437
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
1812787771
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
789984582
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
356657997
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
-883365190
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
-531022093
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
-813290792
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
-1526536301
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
505158029
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
-1321201762
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
1333722174
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
1947774446
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
409341187
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
-637487335
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
1014986451
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
-545680456
shines on."
-316060818

-1840324437
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
-1020937461
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
-1677570522
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
-1777261296
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
-982636846
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
1768955791
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
-1173299075
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
2115075631
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
153411651
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
2090983462
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
-2001800335
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
-333331581
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
-1738547163
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
1616109720
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
-1153843993
as I wished to act.
-1137867372

-1840324437
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
1913164151
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
-1453280302
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
969059504
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
1037720637
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
335252756
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
98673371
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
-54323125
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
1521412592
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
1043643923
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
-685316218
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
975766462
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
-1346332945
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
1366764387
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
1823425646
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
667158526
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
-678746801
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
942089168
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
-1256418071
nature.
-1730832873

-1840324437
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
829958237
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
-616022502
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
-1575674553
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
-143693417
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
-2048260021
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
-1842159531
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
-750963032
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
-155844157
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
-1533225797
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
1132113594
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
2073861195
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
-1938299367
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
2050268968
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
-1591793721
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
1843900565
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
2005960506
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
-689609289
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
1949238602
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
622827562
vivacity of conversation.
-26869340

-1840324437
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
646202572
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
908876317
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
-401640835
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
-980863453
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
757292724
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
-1969015594
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
-1633933907
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
-1106327596
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
-1172742933
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
-1800108437
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
-2030095698
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
650665657
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
-410678561
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
396012961
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
-911433746

-1840324437
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
-705080061
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
-1169543964
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
2073457114

-1840324437
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
556543137

-1840324437
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
-419247056
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
1018741895
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
-223273319
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
-55599726

-1840324437
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
1858794372
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
1868056073
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
-241489274

-1840324437
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
1564390744
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
299109968
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
1859453008
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
-276203245
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
187858917
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
1435220152
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
-266410202

-1840324437
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
1751198406
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
1428819958
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
-541511272

-1840324437
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
-1694291478
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
-222311928

-1840324437
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
-1905046976
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
-390991335
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
1548251775
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
530370811

-1840324437
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
516087206
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
1824470553
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
920634442
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
805237897
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
-1885339750
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
803195645
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
589347926
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
1215872818
least so I thought.
626527007

-1840324437
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
-531517489
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
1374055782
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
-1247296372
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
-1167165914
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
178822526
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
599850489
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
327028390
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
-1655672437
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
-1449096298
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
1461846756

-1840324437
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
12773779
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
757203846
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
1335027558
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
1585769997
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
1569646829
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
-1711608172
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
1186383688

-1840324437
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
80135028
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
2123428107
that "extremes meet."
1459186876

-1840324437
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
-1743929790
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
-1052462360
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
1262166017
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
825873707
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
780978969
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
-291707759
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
575628290
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
-1843494889

-1840324437
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
-1244264943
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
1361100061
a placid eye and smile!"
777034047

-1840324437
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
-2096718952
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
-103180087
Hay Common.
-1531843817

-1840324437
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
1233752859
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
1052470901
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
-451754774
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
1475140593
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
1652666434
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
-578969031
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
709764754
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
1991650358
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
451678770
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
-1175570894
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
-821000965
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
655832251
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
-698124330

-1840324437
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
1045570181
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
1454785660
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
-1843742275
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
-15821362
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
-364868204
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
-307067600
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
-1982875209

-1840324437
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
-896748211
off," replied the magistrate.
1344869116

-1840324437
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
-791737700
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
-1973463559
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
-1486420010
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
-624715066
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
-186186923
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
1523016373
see her?"
-799242191

-1840324437
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
1654303569
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
1450531879

-1840324437
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
1599223124
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
738800470
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
-1693795795
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
706200593

-1840324437
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
1075738875

-1840324437
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
1073050118
must and will do it."
-9082896

-1840324437
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
225289495

-1840324437
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
-598208828

-1840324437
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
41434078
in, of course."
1439135248

-1840324437
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
416903506
throw away such a chance of fun."
-760547755

-1840324437
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
-144970134

-1840324437
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
156002011
in the Dowager Ingram.
-391220348

-1840324437
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
-1634252724
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
-1903038686
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
-1062616050
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
-2061839410
forward."
1407606060

-1840324437
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
-1669355277

-1840324437
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
731235315
Sam!"
-270140034

-1840324437
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
1436030528
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
71225985

-1840324437
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
1424236319

-1840324437
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
1266441399

-1840324437
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
707047458
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
-757368922

-1840324437
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
-1260687374
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
1283914481
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
1323775257
one."
-160307961

-1840324437
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
-863543428
advised, my angel girl--and--"
-1460169596

-1840324437
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
-101946250
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
-1592262414
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
222495935

-1840324437
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
-927468803

-1840324437
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
-775127304

-1840324437
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
1390414882
once more.
-102642222

-1840324437
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
514761177
know who will be her first visitor."
-927103730

-1840324437
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
-276775049
said Colonel Dent.
-1867620745

-1840324437
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
1146653865

-1840324437
Sam went and returned.
-119207592

-1840324437
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
604797390
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
-1371366955
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
476748659

-1840324437
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
1521569893

-1840324437
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
-1302160520
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
1943749816
of his men.
-412112054

-1840324437
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
-1514766658
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
1313404459
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
12150017

-1840324437
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
-1555936982
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
-2014837313
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
-1116563016
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
-1716486267

-1840324437
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
101068881
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
-605508014

-1840324437
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
-1288892038
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
-546723889
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
133425453
her seat, and took it in silence.
-1765232566

-1840324437
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
2022792653

-1840324437
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
-600204590

-1840324437
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
-1297881924
demanded the Misses Eshton.
-927670968

-1840324437
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
-1154190529
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
-507200819
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
1319919322
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
293622770
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
-48676918
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
-1481047819
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
-353392822
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
-1065852680
morning, as he threatened."
892249388

-1840324437
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
1861793710
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
-1184227443
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
1403249757
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
-1877586746
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
-1617405067
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
-974385982
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
-1460883796
whatever revelations had been made her.
-907711893

-1840324437
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
1599919873

-1840324437
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
2099774937
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
-1136318972
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
-686842905
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
907754152
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
1088848451
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
-1473865554

-1840324437
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
-527469883
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
-1283395981
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
1291903356
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
1403579645

-1840324437
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
-1613652897
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
-881957861
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
-2120616138

-1840324437
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
218602317
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
-1812013651
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
-1716899200
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
1432677565
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
-1786623159
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
99538232
they most wished for.
-304959096

-1840324437
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
-721984315
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
856684052
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
2024822281
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
-168213171
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
-1318954371
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
-592452200
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
-1668132293

-1840324437
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
1399849220
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
1300822158
saw Sam.
-1191555295

-1840324437
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
-1341761792
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
-981101061
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
-1063063594
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
-1504301037

-1840324437
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
1936485621
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
518735808
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
-1601375410
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
-1018176149
quietly behind me.
-1967388997

-1840324437
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
-2089953291
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
1191442096

-1840324437
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
-1835429171
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
960085592

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XIX
-1844003647

-1840324437

-1840324437
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
-636464411
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
896120930
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
1691162009
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
-1570806989
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
-2126075546
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
215153735
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
520242084
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
1884216362
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
441224715

-1840324437
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
4625950
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
-759362866
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
103018017
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
1995304363
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
62251962
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
-695262025
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
1941585692
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
1553014132
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
-587077774

-1840324437
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
-765233540
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
-1726458280

-1840324437
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
-609093803
warn you, I have no faith."
-1042872559

-1840324437
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
539728749
your step as you crossed the threshold."
1584354323

-1840324437
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
-1690383098

-1840324437
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
-70618851

-1840324437
"You need them all in your trade."
-1060757974

-1840324437
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
1002203790
you tremble?"
1145739122

-1840324437
"I'm not cold."
1649059459

-1840324437
"Why don't you turn pale?"
2085592284

-1840324437
"I am not sick."
1329749785

-1840324437
"Why don't you consult my art?"
-1502991795

-1840324437
"I'm not silly."
-395740917

-1840324437
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
2026723391
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
1347015375
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
1972417294
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
-346581177
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
-2047857006

-1840324437
"Prove it," I rejoined.
-701165564

-1840324437
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
-1174896011
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
1080839959
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
-97907208
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
-1136408433
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
1408029472
you."
-1924209165

-1840324437
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
-1956432125
with vigour.
1090292844

-1840324437
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
444997445
solitary dependent in a great house."
426977254

-1840324437
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
1210470423
one?"
-1257888036

-1840324437
"In my circumstances."
-1657802916

-1840324437
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
1933171058
placed as you are."
-693138849

-1840324437
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
137761337

-1840324437
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
2142286278
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
1171430403
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
-29843203
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
2025315913

-1840324437
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
-993255169

-1840324437
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
-948635401

-1840324437
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
-1225927555

-1840324437
"To be sure."
1697097820

-1840324437
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
-438436685
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
-610709819
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
-1149341552
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
1382357792

-1840324437
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
-1959443488
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
-1747937804
there."
-1337809096

-1840324437
"I believe you," said I.
1948757282

-1840324437
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
-1117970060
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
1143974275

-1840324437
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
1766927569
begin to put some faith in you presently."
-395771844

-1840324437
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
337825362
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
1209234712
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
-1107839046

-1840324437
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
-841709311
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
1198786272
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
786712608
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
-1294171065
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
-1908125767
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
1069108860

-1840324437
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
-806471813

-1840324437
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
-388288211
whispers of the future?"
909148677

-1840324437
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
651770576
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
-314622473

-1840324437
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
1892357056
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
1097215761

-1840324437
"You have learned them from the servants."
1168544776

-1840324437
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
-1211118119
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
-1805659327

-1840324437
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
1971123779

-1840324437
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
-1762526767
after all, then!"
10149375

-1840324437
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
-754630443
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
646609279
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
2059577434
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
1750671440
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
-242105751
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
-1313764477

-1840324437
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
-1978547756

-1840324437
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
-1972384092

-1840324437
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
951554089
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
2070834419

-1840324437
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
-1228827349

-1840324437
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
-1124430124
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
-573174340

-1840324437
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
844076873

-1840324437
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
-177890443

-1840324437
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
1650308726
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
389801003
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
453704585

-1840324437
"I what?"
-985592871

-1840324437
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
622376574

-1840324437
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
-815019881
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
-2067257702
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
-1498136125
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
1099641855
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
2053018696
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
2045246786

-1840324437
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
-344423530
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
1449907318

-1840324437
"He is not at home."
982015929

-1840324437
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
-2018753067
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
36048956
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
-481863275
it were, out of existence?"
1726312041

-1840324437
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
1018481246
you had introduced."
2123844358

-1840324437
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
-1329098362
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
-1315448083
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
705854592

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
-864890163

-1840324437
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
-2123114618
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
-987709401
the most lively and the most continuous?"
-1542778047

-1840324437
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
1684424668
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
2047057448
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
852026576
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
1705728058
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
-1872581525
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
339228972

-1840324437
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
-131854136
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
-955542276
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
-1281712498
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
234711551
noticed this?"
1072161863

-1840324437
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
1220972676

-1840324437
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
-1176246736
gratitude?"
-1973181149

-1840324437
I said nothing.
431875847

-1840324437
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
-1738764488
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
1759811775

-1840324437
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
496519421

-1840324437
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
-13669420

-1840324437
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
-1220805728
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
814197882

-1840324437
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
409592904

-1840324437
"Shortly?"
1663020616

-1840324437
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
-1741313039
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
-194571085
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
1487926073
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
773591233
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
-47631560
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
476810237
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
1737798608
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
-970524071
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
-817356187
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
1458115403

-1840324437
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
1162773361
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
-561981509

-1840324437
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
660131219
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
-2050815321
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
931649933
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
-2108988280
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
-1098634801
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
-1061645116

-1840324437
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
-2072328008

-1840324437
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
990917931
p190.jpg}
-1459534761

-1840324437
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
15371629
her chair.  She began muttering,--
-1895845681

-1840324437
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
-1006078307
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
-1514348942
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
515259558
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
1811521489
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
-443315611
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
164262916
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
-1263640428
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
2095122480
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
-861226253

-1840324437
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
-1622935107
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
748216724
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
1531415392
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
-1416225060
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
-1029176413
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
-27779372

-1840324437
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
779041716
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
-73669691
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
1509808977
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
492826933
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
1851962490
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
859570703
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
-644447770
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
-1268567377
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
257362611
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
1892813238
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
1262640809
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
-24662941
dictates of conscience.'
204440510

-1840324437
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
1426767380
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
121563897
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
1088542024
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
-1535948651
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
-40220602
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
1056192077
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
-1876858105
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
767215196
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
-1304294058
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
-919803242
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
-1966671007
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
-1077356159
me; the play is played out'."
1891963537

-1840324437
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
2104302638
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
-662278187
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
1355583996
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
1309097531
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
777019907
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
-711316407
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
-2050094682
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
225131305
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
164372476
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
1907602200
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
939699697
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
286165779
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
1983363625

-1840324437
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
1536302660

-1840324437
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
-1651760041

-1840324437
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
-1847380828

-1840324437
"Break it, sir."
1972320313

-1840324437
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
-1614847818
disguise.
235850036

-1840324437
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
466242668

-1840324437
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
9709120

-1840324437
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
1130941336

-1840324437
"But not with you?"
-1743064770

-1840324437
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
2045015953

-1840324437
"What character did I act?  My own?"
-617223462

-1840324437
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
-1057310053
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
-1529987688
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
182614740

-1840324437
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
-36883515

-1840324437
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
474800924
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
1408082790
but it was not right."
276722995

-1840324437
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
-338293894

-1840324437
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
-705102208
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
-1684568991
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
-550732459
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
1046794527
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
1531092732
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
-273305528
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
-545487622
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
-1831600790

-1840324437
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
599887369
signify?"
-1264863353

-1840324437
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
-1848317538
now, I suppose?"
630489456

-1840324437
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
-2056693826
yonder are doing."
-71836793

-1840324437
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
-830253322

-1840324437
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
-283872863

-1840324437
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
1005728142
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
-383921675
left this morning?"
-748479597

-1840324437
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
764808996

-1840324437
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
-1706994850
installing himself here till you returned."
386380893

-1840324437
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
-1544389890

-1840324437
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
469783868
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
-107903511

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
-542714283
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
241768807
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
499188962

-1840324437
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
814562875
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
-15155921
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
-1966989322
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
1623043021
seemed to know what he was doing.
1717127727

-1840324437
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
-1434010968

-1840324437
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
-1306923924

-1840324437
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
518785494

-1840324437
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
1011546041

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
1097349828

-1840324437
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
1716112449
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
-146999768
and dreary look.
-659388256

-1840324437
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
-353092299
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
1658673507

-1840324437
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
-2124494619

-1840324437
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
-2135077224

-1840324437
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
-1848552669

-1840324437
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
-116576712
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
57181073
doing."
-1621319940

-1840324437
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
479474264
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
1936658793
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
-1736447170
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
-1867426611
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
-772004729
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
-1010978294
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
-132128270
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
-1419119816
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
278796016

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
248206288
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
-1104701462

-1840324437
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
-207214744
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
-209410685

-1840324437
"Laughing and talking, sir."
-150008962

-1840324437
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
-706088411
strange?"
-1137731971

-1840324437
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
56923122

-1840324437
"And Mason?"
-785136123

-1840324437
"He was laughing too."
459591869

-1840324437
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
102389634
Jane?"
-1035289317

-1840324437
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
-1945200521

-1840324437
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
1076701711
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
721323159
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
-1242595327

-1840324437
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
-1298745090
you."
-1924209165

-1840324437
"To comfort me?"
-780099588

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
-853493185

-1840324437
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
-968966664

-1840324437
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
856816715
care nothing about it."
1172786448

-1840324437
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
-1774467748

-1840324437
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
426365413
you, I am sure, do."
642198643

-1840324437
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
1286832339
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
1696761603
and then leave me."
908698854

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
-1284244339
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
1876247198
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
-392089945

-1840324437
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
806528635
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
853001703
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
-1297421497

-1840324437
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
1043809741
asleep.
-41439777

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XX
1849616908

-1840324437

-1840324437
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
-1153950336
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
-1395323521
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
1714729752
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
1354050729
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
831297255
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
-1569626849
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
842495852
the curtain.
-665174496

-1840324437
Good God!  What a cry!
-1667617361

-1840324437
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
608488406
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
-1291749603

-1840324437
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
-320352398
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
-444411915
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
2023189970
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
775291738
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
1118294965
it could repeat the effort.
-438790629

-1840324437
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
574500470
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
-1080999506
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
2137728002
voice shouted--
657220280

-1840324437
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
-1805708084

-1840324437
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
1300491502
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
1265056994

-1840324437
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
1515164375

-1840324437
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
1680102406
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
-69956179
was silence.
1456286328

-1840324437
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
-764484444
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
484078030
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
798873720
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
1805536201
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
2035809682
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
-825783692
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
761827248
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
1141557925
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
2123153830
confusion was inextricable.
-1416824411

-1840324437
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
103537165
in his bed."
-528827945

-1840324437
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
-1008785058
coming."
1353488850

-1840324437
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
-565822924
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
680585884
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
1895794261

-1840324437
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
-1049879602
worst at once!"
375835526

-1840324437
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
256413406
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
-1455783212
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
1734154487

-1840324437
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
-549168229
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
516243626

-1840324437
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
-339634055
by an effort, he added--
-656941104

-1840324437
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
-297337717
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
-558437781
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
388266055
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
-1243498792
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
-644687507
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
1022843532
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
-1815077483
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
902940709
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
-521866354

-1840324437
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
1637423705
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
1405878523
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
607593750
had left it.
-2099884369

-1840324437
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
1697879056
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
369822512
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
214187072
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
-860037848
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
91599796
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
-29374573
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
1220485986
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
1374996230
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
1884796387
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
262106531

-1840324437
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
315623927
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
669948726
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
-316601113
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
1502616759
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
49344927
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
-2111651395
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
-1269052568

-1840324437
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
-1989530408

-1840324437
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
-1503418053

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And dressed?"
-2100625743

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Come out, then, quietly."
1127005755

-1840324437
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
-789313707

-1840324437
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
2050667270
noise."
1996622855

-1840324437
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
1127446472
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
2016414220
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
1826519760
side.
1277715153

-1840324437
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
-487838744

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
505123191

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Go back and fetch both."
2050134348

-1840324437
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
-571227583
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
-74079853
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
1598338472
he paused, and addressed me again.
-1064891580

-1840324437
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
1837280529

-1840324437
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
-1610575495

-1840324437
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
42776328

-1840324437
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
-717679926
fit."
1825824899

-1840324437
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
1561475471
the key and opened the door.
-870408506

-1840324437
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
-1395151368
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
-1058008374
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
-506460755
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
364969239
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
-480601220
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
-1277148882
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
1911138855
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
1238905197
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
770934317
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
-74236317
came out and closed the door behind him.
1104713630

-1840324437
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
848367249
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
-453533508
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
-1890179971
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
-846151575
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
971011360
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
-1810593460
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
253062800
blood.
-205002847

-1840324437
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
-2091730650
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
-1349491459
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
162527910
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
-2132303123
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
1570187619
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
-955648917
blood, trickling fast down.
1537400943

-1840324437
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
-1340016182

-1840324437
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
-1462298211
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
-1301397037
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
1854930435

-1840324437
"Sir?"
-237475588

-1840324437
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
1154707373
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
-1771767317
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
-2104711306
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
-1504231447
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
-280927338
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
1587584358
consequences."
-442192667

-1840324437
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
391512247
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
-2062890329
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
-1121928929
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
-581140891
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
74405598
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
-1415824544
step ceased to be heard.
155309297

-1840324437
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
-178952341
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
1283444220
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
-1456171026
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
-2132792154
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
94616841

-1840324437
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
1897287620
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
421806067
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
-702482573
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
-2088688848
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
-322752438
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
2123870341
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
-1304761074
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
-717552194
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
744067534
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
1535179564
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
1264034606
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
1268624008

-1840324437
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
-1114336696
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
-927547119
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
-9741207
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
-4257032
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
-1337309452
subordinate's form.
-1302432809

-1840324437
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
-1545151095
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
-1710366349
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
-1480612954
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
442205339
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
-767249932

-1840324437
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
1716151807
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
1763036123
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
775454318
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
1135883729
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
330322696
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
708774282

-1840324437
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
694401212
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
-1349355697
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
-191708898
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
-201771000
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
-760565461
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
-175032486
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
-1308203493
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
-2102826298
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
-62064747
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
-416134713
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
-1925641618
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
-1417941976
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
-1103277722
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
-1747154029
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
-2086445268
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
-1496539078
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
1749975988
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
261043589
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
-1130769001

-1840324437
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
-481814732
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
413621182
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
376638824
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
490136826
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
1884358758

-1840324437
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
-456560090
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
196066376
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
954607721
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
-1973690276
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
373660783
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
-1656743258
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
-1990293574
I might not even speak to him.
1820207553

-1840324437
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
766328945
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
-710093446
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
-1525035384
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
-1334463415
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
968415366
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
-266400947
shorter.
-520743892

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
1477088508

-1840324437
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
699498866
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
154796721
patient downstairs and all."
-651558927

-1840324437
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
-930406979

-1840324437
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
-2041466246
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
-63576006

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
1934043921
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
-2083702171
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
316975802
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
-2008860014

-1840324437
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
1298588488

-1840324437
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
-153024137

-1840324437
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
1281880866
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
-1299419043
there's no danger."
-634863520

-1840324437
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
-1875610492
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
-1790596499
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
-633681941
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
-2002564234
here!"
887628359

-1840324437
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
-1322833907
Rochester got the knife from her."
1699318458

-1840324437
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
1093820171
said Mr. Rochester.
1356424265

-1840324437
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
1825031379
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
463041257
looked so quiet at first."
1957226752

-1840324437
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
-1948423548
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
1466690968
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
133878003
alone."
1657495620

-1840324437
"I thought I could have done some good."
-17295182

-1840324437
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
-237446878
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
-1166321381
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
-685668791
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
1803524240

-1840324437
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
1459378804
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
1142574193

-1840324437
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
53429423

-1840324437
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
-905713953
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
-524611492
said--
2060708905

-1840324437
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
126289015
it."
-1310628268

-1840324437
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
706814934

-1840324437
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
-1894496846
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
-777270121
think of her at all."
-245823235

-1840324437
"Impossible to forget this night!"
-1151396517

-1840324437
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
-721940219
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
-1417110778
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
-217616322
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
-430273003
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
-1935221899
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
-1298308343
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
2136843177

-1840324437
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
1361822236
and returned with them.
641455381

-1840324437
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
1430744237
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
-1043377841

-1840324437
I retired as directed.
-1001606397

-1840324437
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
2127021542
Rochester presently.
2027300803

-1840324437
"No, sir; all was very still."
896787641

-1840324437
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
2131480251
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
-1771150478
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
688024273
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
-923100796
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
1738470299
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
-1273455135
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
551504354

-1840324437
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
-1946763054
edged with fur.
1158684703

-1840324437
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
-1679604833
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
2120745560
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
-385503963
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
-1360825836
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
-741068822

-1840324437
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
-299190939

-1840324437
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
-348428289
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
-1734737957
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
-1774995833
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
-768011820
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
-1313393480

-1840324437
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
2089430065
the washstand.
-615576670

-1840324437
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
1932070779

-1840324437
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
2104113143
to Mason.
1347207899

-1840324437
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
849692076

-1840324437
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
-2062714050

-1840324437
"Drink! drink! drink!"
-1393040643

-1840324437
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
1990717316
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
-352132794
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
-614920081
liquid; he then took his arm--
732808810

-1840324437
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
248925890

-1840324437
The patient rose.
594590892

-1840324437
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
397652334
step out--that's it!"
-860205257

-1840324437
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
503279087

-1840324437
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
382854306
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
1483755193
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
-45926862
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
1521100374
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
-763713016

-1840324437
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
546807674
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
-293304310
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
-1481328545
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
-1648967562
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
-1967574183
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
867985276
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
46990110
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
-1212889817
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
267445196
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
1898595606
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
615633857
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
-1098844199

-1840324437
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
-416459534
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
-118009158
chaise; Carter followed.
-1448243857

-1840324437
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
-851221326
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
-1214173064
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
1002026932

-1840324437
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
-1206069702

-1840324437
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
1189757005
Dick."
-181892726

-1840324437
"Fairfax--"
260778211

-1840324437
"Well what is it?"
-1996498021

-1840324437
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
311613500
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
-296365894

-1840324437
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
1375103898
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
1857216410

-1840324437
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
550090540
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
805700828

-1840324437
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
-768391170
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
106173473
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
650996099
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
1500055416

-1840324437
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
757496614
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
-1248645710

-1840324437
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
-51538846

-1840324437
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
1834090761
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
-908129107
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
180943894
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
-959665024
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
1993970028
pure."
-100098058

-1840324437
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
-1440934846
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
-1411205344
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
1322428412
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
-1774778364
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
836029847
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
-241707043
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
-1065000166
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
624798879

-1840324437
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
1677746233

-1840324437
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
1474777689
me.
597905161

-1840324437
"Thank you, sir."
-1660011811

-1840324437
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
1767388899
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
996503065
atmosphere?"
1785819283

-1840324437
"I do, very much."
1280114195

-1840324437
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
1925984921

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
1558285868
with Mason?"
1049663916

-1840324437
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
-1340219137

-1840324437
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
-46087500
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
1376836230
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
743553364

-1840324437
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
-1938566055

-1840324437
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
2134370731
thoughts."
121022426

-1840324437
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
-465763890

-1840324437
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
-317444571

-1840324437
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
2137763889

-1840324437
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
-798442539
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
404702929
spue fire any day."
-1064982494

-1840324437
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
-318658022
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
-749929137
you."
-1924209165

-1840324437
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
-2091257805
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
-1187361538
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
402168764

-1840324437
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
1204210707
how to avert the danger."
-11630926

-1840324437
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
-1859201787
from him.
-1625458065

-1840324437
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
-1930441129
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
-2069151531
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
856269501
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
-184716871
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
357841959
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
636922484
friend, are you not?"
-1265581048

-1840324437
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
1923298192

-1840324437
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
1081425702
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
490748433
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
52176943
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
143911553
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
-1329338647
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
1082976579
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
1187783366
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
1065676096
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
-1946622408
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
-769472538
me at once."
-1492581043

-1840324437
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
-166000130
you are very safe."
-1330086682

-1840324437
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
240169153

-1840324437
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
1409422345
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
-1969593947
before him.
507973401

-1840324437
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
-278558296
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
1503519034

-1840324437
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
558993107

-1840324437
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
-1932090463
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
-36990835
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
-1882658543
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
1806373834
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
1078493069
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
1140968225

-1840324437
"No, sir; I am content."
-1732510953

-1840324437
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
-1240710657
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
68805861
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
1234377448
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
418597540
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
891516223
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
-852454745
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
-1134446205
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
-384604580
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
-1551999971
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
-1518468355
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
-1894673894
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
613521449
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
1921625837
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
-903104776
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
723625216
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
977312939
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
-1143125692
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
-377065435
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
-1759290807
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
1468109537
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
-539549366
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
-1011179756
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
1616556758
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
226176590
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
1608841760
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
-253006360
judgment approves?"
-1803928261

-1840324437
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
-627451087
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
-1182907577
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
1997937154
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
-122589710
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
1038708847

-1840324437
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
-1254140934

-1840324437
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
1446051126
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
-116972548
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
1574343088
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
-1310724784

-1840324437
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
-520736192
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
-1125236816
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
1211874442
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
-1010428981
amend and solace to heal."
-1680536410

-1840324437
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
1276226411
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
-1132361156
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
-257809088
instrument for my cure in--"
-445985133

-1840324437
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
-1628974730
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
-907041386
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
1886897378
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
-1499410391
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
1318722998

-1840324437
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
106255801
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
-1800857842
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
711386666
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
1025344316

-1840324437
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
-1377237198
came back he was humming a tune.
587981391

-1840324437
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
1142250220
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
-1750398495

-1840324437
"Curse you?  No, sir."
2053755662

-1840324437
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
263718221
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
-839833939
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
-1801553908

-1840324437
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
-1687411349

-1840324437
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
-1996426338
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
-1407715385
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
-491067497

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
-1719408297

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
-496205463
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
5011644
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
1640443803

-1840324437
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
73561867
cheerfully--
887926673

-1840324437
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
-823247274
I rose at four to see him off."
-1704356173

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXI
-1939174059

-1840324437

-1840324437
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
537700806
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
765473921
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
549324953
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
749434775
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
1722423172
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
2116953193
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
-195682623
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
-213616039
man.
189476210

-1840324437
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
-657378492
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
2088788917
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
1883168401
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
1545298959
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
1687074349
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
1281566044
little sister.
-1894118375

-1840324437
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
115270989
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
-208654291
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
1229429341
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
-1676120131
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
-767784230
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
-2039773225
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
-2090705593
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
-2125089957
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
-278308052

-1840324437
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
479928182
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
-364361551
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
-1143598891
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
-1969613029
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
-726393698
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
63616892
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
-1292272942
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
-1148133808
was surrounded with a crape band.
2050875824

-1840324437
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
-1549062188
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
-1116469867
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
305841845

-1840324437
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
802616214
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
687331170
are married to Bessie?"
-1241046141

-1840324437
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
1482306400
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
-491115948
child are thriving."
335007443

-1840324437
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
55860241

-1840324437
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
641947331
badly at present--in great trouble."
-1380813830

-1840324437
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
1586897483
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
1422334250

-1840324437
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
-885019441

-1840324437
"Mr. John?"
1590950844

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"And how does his mother bear it?"
559107651

-1840324437
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
1491326092
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
-1632708487
his death was shocking."
1806440036

-1840324437
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
-850722061

-1840324437
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
-1718910536
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
183648965
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
1840519734
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
-1005071304
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
1319991110
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
-48868080
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
-1232777397
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
392777017
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
-707943776

-1840324437
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
435245636

-1840324437
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
1458338746
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
205236352
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
569952522
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
-1459344216
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
612867834
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
-361702047
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
-2126365207
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
-1673581362
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
546123534
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
-1296100148
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
-444478560
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
512114964
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
-383267899
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
-918977060
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
646562449
morning."
778725168

-1840324437
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
-1527335146

-1840324437
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
-1550332697
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
-327843149

-1840324437
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
293265061
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
-1793228922
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
2009212959

-1840324437
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
-997727670
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
1693015782
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
-1131506281
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
-1863671329
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
184174822
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
92565526
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
-1466269736
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
-1476338095
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
875403463
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
-1968365148
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
43759520
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
-1094168619
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
-620376319
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
-1412160941
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
1340996273
lineaments.
646967913

-1840324437
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
-1676749389
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
771627482
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
-926934948
cue and followed me from the room.
-1460018231

-1840324437
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
-644252181
which he had shut.
-1672455045

-1840324437
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
-148491578

-1840324437
"What to do?--where to go?"
1982975522

-1840324437
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
-1139968702

-1840324437
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
1172079273

-1840324437
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
1665661431

-1840324437
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
686429875
people to see her that distance?"
-1153847362

-1840324437
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
-1092897641

-1840324437
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
-1609178163

-1840324437
"It is his widow, sir."
234256090

-1840324437
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
-1849460716

-1840324437
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
-641201560

-1840324437
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
1339574359
had no relations."
-808627530

-1840324437
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
700546969
off."
1539827831

-1840324437
"Why?"
500216564

-1840324437
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
1520887597

-1840324437
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
-1595355434
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
-1049020738
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
-1202594341
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
-1385160193
in London."
-649342995

-1840324437
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
1110160626
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
1883639204
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
-2043535625

-1840324437
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
-1315934820
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
1773998054
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
-833066897

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
1713360099
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
1124904456

-1840324437
"How long will you stay?"
234399414

-1840324437
"As short a time as possible, sir."
-950160688

-1840324437
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
643390023

-1840324437
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
1822679232

-1840324437
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
-649776731
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
-979445953

-1840324437
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
-329937811

-1840324437
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
1145280870

-1840324437
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
-1866717253

-1840324437
"A person to be trusted?"
-1381215813

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
-186582722

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
-2035520939

-1840324437
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
800082047

-1840324437
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
-1607579641
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
-336239841
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
-144225884

-1840324437
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
-1958571408
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
-1883790548
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
1952420216
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
293901827
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
-155369406

-1840324437
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
-441124618

-1840324437
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
-1709852879
if recollecting something, he said--
-1440404923

-1840324437
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
1440446847
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
1681552788
plenty?"
-1066672582

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
11916147

-1840324437
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
-1657122876

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
-2027727254
while I have the opportunity."
725203568

-1840324437
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
97063410

-1840324437
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
264655695
married?"
145320150

-1840324437
"Yes; what then?"
2022918983

-1840324437
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
-109782315
perceive the necessity of it."
-2097981985

-1840324437
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
307863635
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
-720833444
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
-1979742371
straight to--the devil?"
1386904497

-1840324437
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
66238604

-1840324437
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
1954077010
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
1740116843

-1840324437
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
1161583432
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
1112550719

-1840324437
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
-418129471
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
-1420131919

-1840324437
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
156121376
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
27479543
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
1311991894

-1840324437
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
685946749
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
-91756544

-1840324437
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
1196019189
five pounds, Jane."
1476791276

-1840324437
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
-1525168945

-1840324437
"Just let me look at the cash."
-46357185

-1840324437
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
367522112

-1840324437
"Jane!"
857528667

-1840324437
"Sir?"
-237475588

-1840324437
"Promise me one thing."
878081120

-1840324437
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
729629733

-1840324437
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
-1071524426
find you one in time."
-1788100384

-1840324437
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
318217676
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
-682689631
it."
-1310628268

-1840324437
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
-1301581023
then?"
-1837121143

-1840324437
"Yes, sir; early."
-1298461640

-1840324437
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
-1942132469

-1840324437
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
-209984421

-1840324437
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
1345629164

-1840324437
"I suppose so, sir."
-1474381888

-1840324437
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
1711230640
not quite up to it."
738368404

-1840324437
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
1499710806

-1840324437
"Then say it."
-1320759356

-1840324437
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
1865349365

-1840324437
"What must I say?"
-2093042781

-1840324437
"The same, if you like, sir."
103055902

-1840324437
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
-1312762008

-1840324437
"Yes?"
135840407

-1840324437
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
612389643
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
2073533683
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
-792302477
than say Farewell, Jane?"
-2113601921

-1840324437
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
-188617957
as in many."
-317362698

-1840324437
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
-135558851

-1840324437
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
1895402520
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
-1547726667
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
-465395673
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
512644306

-1840324437
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
-1228631304
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
371408197
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
-292091480
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
132423335
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
-6017722
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
902829757

-1840324437
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
-972750332

-1840324437
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
-1465366081
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
1403992300

-1840324437
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
-1784214759
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
1274726508
will finally recover."
-822692657

-1840324437
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
-1526683652

-1840324437
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
724404325
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
-1748594451
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
-201078753
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
-1180160409
and then I will go up with you?"
613538418

-1840324437
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
1991857062
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
-1218170146
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
408699125
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
-447210510
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
724778649

-1840324437
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
-200026601
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
532975612
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
1045605768
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
382302835
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
-1782926535
looks.
-1587282997

-1840324437
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
1859370462
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
1680393881
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
-1202621184
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
-747879125
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
1398096210
obeyed her as in bygone days.
-5808207

-1840324437
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
-1574500590
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
486002098
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
-714199668
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
961497845
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
1356924809
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
367306653
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
390671743

-1840324437
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
1635339459
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
1265824970
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
1874051699
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
-683387122
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
1263918137
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
1935799225
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
1618324104
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
1208994863
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
349115004
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
-1209017518
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
-692009541
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
992439492

-1840324437
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
-885555904
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
1673002945

-1840324437
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
-1889373590
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
-1939003073
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
416003043
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
1656946887
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
-1524810003
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
1398772490
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
-878535656
past recognition.
775250957

-1840324437
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
1812438428
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
-506106681
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
-1649272321
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
432059253
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
-2081801869
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
-1575347072
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
228912352
colourless visage.
-1467004497

-1840324437
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
1634079489
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
1129355403
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
-675945419
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
-720218357
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
1080560416
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
245857286
other's looked puritanical.
-41278083

-1840324437
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
-726370065
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
-51214686
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
-1150975574
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
-1423030874
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
-429393309

-1840324437
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
-317682149
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
-1997446284
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
607331407
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
-348439831
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
-355629143
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
1876587984
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
-863793816
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
1801133251
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
679665597
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
-327185458
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
-1194822080
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
-128858597
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
825053952

-1840324437
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
1997999729
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
1961173466
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
267427511
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
-566764382
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
30921151
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
-948656931
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
-1550797558
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
1404654944
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
-2109284485

-1840324437
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
1844848824
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
107026503
liberty.
-1017119856

-1840324437
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
-1210171100
can see her to-night."
-690404072

-1840324437
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
242544107
should be much obliged to you."
-1511610289

-1840324437
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
-1055747935
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
-2099876525
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
1350392095

-1840324437
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
-406869305
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
220414669
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
-177899523
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
-1774243217
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
1122732250
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
1560685540
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
1621793413
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
-384971693
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
839751840
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
-648435495
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
862898122
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
-1213630485
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
-1853557526
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
1188112985
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
1070514306

-1840324437
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
2017058992
us see if she will know you."
-2040419279

-1840324437
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
-353663350
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
246003539
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
-2001506996
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
375055018
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
706619506
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
860701707
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
1583727491
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
-776354745
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
-1432954387
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
379246625
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
-586011370

-1840324437
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
-337872308
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
2008117379
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
1036089141
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
-695899392
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
-1478135749
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
-541382254
amity.
-868634437

-1840324437
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
-1217196782
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
-2048189712
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
1390225753
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
1405192813
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
661856749
she looked at me.
-416746401

-1840324437
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
1000033705

-1840324437
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
1430100587

-1840324437
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
1966427708
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
-595156957
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
-1984948273
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
1116750193
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
-1239964317
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
184920749
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
1978237872
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
-1549479472
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
131663905
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
-1546134573
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
1708854624
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
-1414823566

-1840324437
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
1911075142
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
481437156
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
-1607200032
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
-2082668193
the pillow.
-296435101

-1840324437
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
-698323970
till I see how you get on."
-1208081840

-1840324437
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
899037423

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
-1980846118
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
-1119438935
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
-1994220712
say--let me see--"
648953532

-1840324437
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
194336769
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
-1995318320
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
-1134470910
was at once irritated.
-223646325

-1840324437
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
-1148414292
you Jane Eyre?"
2108684779

-1840324437
"I am Jane Eyre."
-248986154

-1840324437
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
-77716057
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
-1889383316
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
1159626647
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
-628160580
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
-806299678
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
-776638787
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
1110543958
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
2066259621
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
-346357238

-1840324437
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
-237155529

-1840324437
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
1977233359
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
1041976856
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
-675912822
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
210947142
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
-1821107120
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
-1269579023
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
1902325674
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
-251362385
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
106252044
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
758533978
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
-48707391
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
389953896
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
-1499838137
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
2039350605
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
-1306693540
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
-111769310
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
1964997150
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
-1560669933
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
901966828
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
-1877191586
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
-2073425780
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
-823558482
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
-1157859922
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
1882655924

-1840324437
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
-1549473537
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
-1808846686

-1840324437
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
1157916378
the morning she is calmer."
1382057684

-1840324437
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
-155132601
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
808924188
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
2146083029
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
-1469985437
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
-1655965874
had?"
-214612371

-1840324437
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
907405469
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
-990081920
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
-1141791713

-1840324437
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
-1294368215
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
2121069122
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
-737375366
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
971311162
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
-705144254
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
1362280232
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
732403659
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
311642093
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
1583422190
for both.
-1026522314

-1840324437
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
-1799632680
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
1244679946
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
91042599
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
1766525624
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
373746419
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
-660016233
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
860297857
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
1113733294

-1840324437
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
-1562740830
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
239381499
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
789300013
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
-2103753250
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
-1236620185
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
2057452531
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
642074411
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
1367698758
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
-996648015
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
-1463817020
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
1758674976
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
-748058945
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
-579985819
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
2106610297
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
-157502870
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
-1319505360
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
-1038075471
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
785853260
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
-1120402604
and content.
1565938953

-1840324437
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
-30164302
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
1184037229
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
968079666
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
-741089841
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
-1069480791
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
662471641
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
1450386318
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
-1347662728
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
-63996782
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
1696921737
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
-1317779161
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
-579015668
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
1094385235
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
-361298239
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
-815007931
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
-362281963
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
-721278355
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
-1206179354
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
-224260551
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
987136274
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
1952857221
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
-244600109
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
-1164436014
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
-346021256
mother's sick-room, and no more.
2011428172

-1840324437
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
864656760
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
-2019121933
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
698156491
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
271952396
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
-1624448012
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
2027250490
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
-1893545644
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
2139897668
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
2140745692
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
90388134
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
-2097949832
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
1987538526
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
735244305
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
298590257
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
-582974390
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
-1115546865
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
290817190
vary its clockwork regularity.
556752375

-1840324437
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
438906762
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
-1368166708
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
-1114456473
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
1151730530
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
-1733172946
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
-1052624804
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
-1929275195
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
-1702582701
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
962198944
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
-1616231605

-1840324437
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
1114954547
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
835967011
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
-1827086308

-1840324437
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
1946634552
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
-964067198
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
-1864852870
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
-1937962938
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
183340009
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
-1721476395
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
-608059707
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
2097667470
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
-1658780053
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
1913650242
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
1856906596

-1840324437
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
1407688157
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
463329636
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
1102046699
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
1764616348
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
1809127444
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
1372022184
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
842404206
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
64638951
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
-1937235474
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
-1709057063
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
1158034169
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
1635965756
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
1339752994
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
-1717471930
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
-3129012
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
-966386993
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
1934923274
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
-1964716190
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
-742711065
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
1783449279
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
2000179532
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
1321919928
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
-1696752064
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
-226291670
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
-1465680363
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
1403100443
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
1420178800
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
-644810168
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
1240058418
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
-1293866620
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
-2047246923
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
1338943026

-1840324437
She closed her lips.
364811587

-1840324437
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
970811029
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
2045556021
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
2112457017
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
1892915495
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
1498819490
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
674220648
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
-644733203
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
2864023
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
1111146438

-1840324437
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
-548157639
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
315771219
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
-910245838
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
1607621024
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
269127678

-1840324437
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
2064938707
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
-1586446539
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
1521876963
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
167391496
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
699587375
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
1704289421

-1840324437
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
34188978
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
-1375061991
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
36934891
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
1013335109
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
-1942990554
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
1269303484
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
155575245
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
508251382
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
-1768258345
me, and then I moved away to the window.
1120620857

-1840324437
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
-1754685514
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
1166821189
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
-1149580774
tenement--flit when at length released?"
-1616486999

-1840324437
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
860425793
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
-976623071
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
-1738375157
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
1605845336
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
764096758
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
-1931532497
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
-1536310662

-1840324437
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
1240332999
her.
-285984867

-1840324437
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
-289870707

-1840324437
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
-1153429358
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
1879981192
me--where is Bessie?"
-77711707

-1840324437
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
1860596671

-1840324437
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
-1795722688
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
810804764
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
922411967

-1840324437
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
-1203623690
identity.
1282028980

-1840324437
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
159009657
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
-341905483
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
-150792390
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
1422066641
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
-1657256872
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
987787926

-1840324437
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
1584217196
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
1167279529
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
711443161
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
-451859163
or is there no one in the room but you?"
-1411614479

-1840324437
I assured her we were alone.
77463421

-1840324437
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
-1348424994
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
2001560670
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
68354699
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
-831661559
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
1568389287

-1840324437
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
-645072037
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
-1819736960
of the last pang.
1220497775

-1840324437
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
-371563397
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
-371459965
there."
-1337809096

-1840324437
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
1848617135

-1840324437
It was short, and thus conceived:--
-241107152

-1840324437
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
-800452725
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
2023189480
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
1070363177
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
196841528
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
-82137005
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
1856386650

-1840324437
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
378590883

-1840324437
It was dated three years back.
42790818

-1840324437
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
250768322

-1840324437
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
251145858
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
-1156890381
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
353336654
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
-1448426400
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
168834916
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
1241810743
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
1877369196
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
396658963
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
-959780314
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
1856668882

-1840324437
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
-1963901256
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
1970438392
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
1248174266
passed since that day."
-485467308

-1840324437
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
1791986255
drawn breath, she went on thus--
468959628

-1840324437
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
118471705
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
415856719
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
-1666876902
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
987962964
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
1243547853
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
1892805849
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
1282751218
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
-574347275

-1840324437
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
1524943289
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
-959728946

-1840324437
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
897583465
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
-797980556
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
-518145253
violence, I can never comprehend."
718200208

-1840324437
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
1162409803
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
-1053299459
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
95699590
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
369519677

-1840324437
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
-2137120054
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
1844300715
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
-1190683471
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
-1680121614
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
497955706

-1840324437
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
-1871709610
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
-33944096

-1840324437
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
389424599
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
53487642
she must hate me still.
-515520508

-1840324437
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
1712882155
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
1679977871
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
-1864663033
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
-1754695259
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
920336676
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
-64272589
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
-1143050550
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
-797030388
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
-109892772
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
-1147502175
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
-1392215092
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
494674061
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
1216221142
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
1525718066
form.
-529421066

-1840324437
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
970332077
observed--
1771203752

-1840324437
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
-475779023
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
-30053452
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
1723092614
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
-1554612683

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXII
-774808204

-1840324437

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
1234269166
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
-1811672641
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
-1898296270
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
741728033
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
1793161197
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
1679170133
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
-1442044275
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
1810816910
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
915974270
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
738128251
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
1648740717
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
1553932995
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
1474230512
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
2119862328
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
1238456723
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
2028568055
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
293628138
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
-344515986
patient and compliant on my part."
-1229859244

-1840324437
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
1251340891
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
1256988768
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
400337756
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
2042822342
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
1390507849
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
-862021664
notes of condolence.
-914863095

-1840324437
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
868348092
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
1277288879
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
-1552868111
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
-1492029446
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
-1342830405
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
266490230
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
892089230
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
1622165448
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
-1024719578
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
-927379618
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
1211359577
veil."
-1826248386

-1840324437
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
-614035712
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
-2132819200
good may it do you!"
53918055

-1840324437
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
-2026639213
you have some sense."
6925011

-1840324437
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
1808943577
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
-2009779063
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
-198367955
much care."
-655751420

-1840324437
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
2030493555
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
-384979387
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
-1248643170
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
1417290867
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
796405336
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
-1274898176
fortune.
1944574129

-1840324437
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
841106733
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
2077804820
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
-244936819
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
1380895449
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
1782083337
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
-1242188890
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
257723433
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
1335759241
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
551476399

-1840324437
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
744706683
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
948185390
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
216417807
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
-651737193
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
-203137022
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
60401850
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
-373738556
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
-1882650343
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
-1843247275
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
-1365091353
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
-7091915
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
-952185968

-1840324437
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
-167797775
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
-1278999488
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
1115778849
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
1713093692
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
-1126438878
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
-1575143855
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
1780256647
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
2076546293
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
182449194
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
-1224360510
don't doubt it."
-184401426

-1840324437
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
-482367176
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
1409082695
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
81812690
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
-367709867
both her and me.
-665194811

-1840324437
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
-280279312
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
-1200733017
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
-1610770749
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
-1681927816
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
-1038750154
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
-606077600

-1840324437
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
-79113049
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
-1029151740
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
1668288736
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
1958946812
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
-125287471
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
-1903739733
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
162132777

-1840324437
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
304515360
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
88293682
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
1493616064
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
784476283
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
-1019753557
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
1628023049
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
1701560039

-1840324437
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
309787079
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
724938169
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
-811250824
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
1464932997
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
-866930024
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
-569811528
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
-925966800

-1840324437
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
129647527
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
-278779453
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
-1352044918
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
1810516682
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
-334727501
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
2129360115
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
-719772182
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
603619704

-1840324437
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
-2032416928
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
678902956
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
572086310
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
-1454159733
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
-1458884560
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
-2097383325

-1840324437
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
-1524532374
are!  Come on, if you please."
-1653323873

-1840324437
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
-1898021847
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
2099350809
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
-713242984
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
-764997897
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
1851699492
behave with decent composure.
1694434270

-1840324437
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
1350439105
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
-1359926186
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
1169369156
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
-429404637
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
1024847067
month?"
-1836111505

-1840324437
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
-305951047

-1840324437
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
-1283779430
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
-91696062
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
-2138184050
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
-752628848
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
1630651851
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
1327303574
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
732575058

-1840324437
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
1846299402
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
-812628357
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
366835514
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
-153198470
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
1895386723
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
-1235977442
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
274607024
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
196499907
that it were my home!
-1494928121

-1840324437
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
1539607584
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
-1363245927

-1840324437
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
-447379066

-1840324437
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
-1835530448

-1840324437
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
-1529111970

-1840324437
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
687203691

-1840324437
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
-1867323602
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
-323152794
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
1126220743
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
-264317363
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
-857709089
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
49093706

-1840324437
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
-1502206375
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
138400183
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
2074338894

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
175139343
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
2042205647
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
-537075021
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
-216251933
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
-1603282072
shed it over me now.
-1511124221

-1840324437
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
-446573386
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
-1678696371

-1840324437
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
1083536069
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
370228800
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
-72657917
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
2039573941

-1840324437
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
-1394237692
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
1681747817

-1840324437
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
-1969055249
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
707476842
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
1608513655
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
69685378
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
875992975
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
244803159

-1840324437
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
247878757
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
2058883027
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
-1582732089
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
237186569
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
-1300068966
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
-1121530798
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
1679196651
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
2143871266
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
-142679358
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
-1220918426
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
-1060938275
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
-1691509511
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
-1131985796
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
1981609907

-1840324437
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
908075419
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
864718750
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
-1073035956
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
1639729818
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
1381022000
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
2013061537
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
-187788437

-1840324437
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
-1623313382
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
-49788809
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
938340706
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
-418135326
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
1300723802
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
-1513846742
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
-465197891
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
-1740842475
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
-765838423
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
-125567388
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
-1367526996
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
-1603879623
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
-1529375317

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXIII
-1630965433

-1840324437

-1840324437
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
953933417
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
1838987319
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
1321651865
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
-1494302387
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
1232663043
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
629978094
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
2139242749
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
1094001728

-1840324437
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
500170807
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
-1134459068
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
-111665745

-1840324437
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
1000382291
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
452546726
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
809596739
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
802258196
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
20539971
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
-1790224715
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
-1210929422
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
-1520242809

-1840324437
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
-1971926702
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
1139731523
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
1645748785
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
-978881217
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
1117492806
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
-1140899054
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
-1830835108
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
774252189
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
-1933459550
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
1839879233
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
564620720
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
-2040444439
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
1797052204
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
2087455846
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
-308324413

-1840324437
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
1527029698
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
-476516552
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
-1443543821
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
-987498147
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
552705443
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
565185103
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
-1047577515
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
894798554
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
-990166389

-1840324437
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
1235454754
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
-833878180
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
1235053200
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
-1258495416
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
-630779554
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
-825435683
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
930399339

-1840324437
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
-844883274
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
-797319713

-1840324437
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
-366360898
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
-62622264
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
2035547911
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
1354936730
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
1001886724
turning--
-1462378355

-1840324437
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
-255310497

-1840324437
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
2134062181
started at first, and then I approached him.
-1622247489

-1840324437
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
-1284531592
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
1440533704
there! he is flown."
692760025

-1840324437
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
1516958103
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
1909590505

-1840324437
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
-190245649
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
1404327322
moonrise."
759891476

-1840324437
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
937875690
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
507341172
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
-1087846278
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
-1135601409
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
-140501385
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
-1762227543
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
865265475
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
-1020777437
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
469378714
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
-170479822
mind was unconscious and quiet.
-1918275695

-1840324437
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
1712831017
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
147381949
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
925817556

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
-1670869255
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
-726029204
Adhesiveness?"
1336382188

-1840324437
"I am attached to it, indeed."
-1704074344

-1840324437
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
-698770475
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
-1723415870
simple dame Fairfax?"
798434707

-1840324437
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
649811155

-1840324437
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
247085359

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
-1127431607
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
-312649792
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
19552246
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
582277818

-1840324437
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
-1459168984

-1840324437
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
-2097612498
must."
-234705614

-1840324437
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
1686518324

-1840324437
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
1167767626

-1840324437
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
-1761481401

-1840324437
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
160080170

-1840324437
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
247102160
straight on the head."
1390694850

-1840324437
"Soon, sir?"
503137707

-1840324437
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
-510046963
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
-1043910247
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
1041836614
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
693542637
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
-1498387552
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
1601672671
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
1854261029
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
58769829
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
1937803906
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
807334871
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
-911609149
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
1890322521
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
626999351
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
1016387617
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
1685374867
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
380113425
Eyre, must get a new situation."
-1548591897

-1840324437
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
802529987
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
1449737243
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
-2012310316
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
1139262893

-1840324437
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
837693933
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
730988672
for you."
1432986497

-1840324437
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
1130261879

-1840324437
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
-498773812
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
-178755297
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
1587427309
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
-846724314
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
949410155
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
-1612048583
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
612470368

-1840324437
"It is a long way off, sir."
412079422

-1840324437
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
2053585331
distance."
289024630

-1840324437
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
-1268902707

-1840324437
"From what, Jane?"
-171358854

-1840324437
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
-290343047

-1840324437
"Well?"
-1332934482

-1840324437
"From _you_, sir."
1987391516

-1840324437
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
-816564063
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
-161907678
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
1336702062
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
-1399260090
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
673475924
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
-1005606116
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
-1406171154
loved.
1791623333

-1840324437
"It is a long way," I again said.
-718900817

-1840324437
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
1466167024
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
1536292802
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
2124421883
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
-1557912670

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
2072112133
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
2113257761
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
319199449
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
1240529968
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
-262587505
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
-151914293
there together."  He seated me and himself.
525545656

-1840324437
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
773089936
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
49960880
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
-1949066954

-1840324437
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
866063789

-1840324437
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
215884296
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
474025893
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
1611500889
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
-1679888487
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
1977605452
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
1539793839
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
-692188660
As for you,--you'd forget me."
1016190121

-1840324437
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
1330102521

-1840324437
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
-568050001

-1840324437
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
-1965203341
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
-2032783669
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
-1297496793
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
-296625330

-1840324437
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
-1738818429

-1840324437
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
1918149518
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
1561517251
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
1161100111
speak.
-973402210

-1840324437
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
966691717
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
1385027372
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
1445289696
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
1457869600
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
-103057070
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
-1942203466
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
1850605927
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
-164662504
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
1473512050
on the necessity of death."
1070409032

-1840324437
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
1988005657

-1840324437
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
601595507

-1840324437
"In what shape?"
-981766419

-1840324437
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
-1072429064

-1840324437
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
-2133344915

-1840324437
"But you will have."
2100993476

-1840324437
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
1255768159

-1840324437
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
-1578376588

-1840324437
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
298149862

-1840324437
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
-279101999
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
-1966792638
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
-2022743984
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
-1903403466
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
-250866067
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
-1896021130
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
-547986697
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
-15971617
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
-1575047186
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
568950721
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
519253022
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
-811737841

-1840324437
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
-1603744663
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
-259108293
Jane!"
-1830746480

-1840324437
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
-1992461331
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
-2122910540
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
978183152
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
-1849281138
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
-89839603

-1840324437
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
490672593

-1840324437
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
240152001

-1840324437
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
1871962577
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
-1288163995

-1840324437
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
-1908974985
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
1828340633

-1840324437
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
1102388691

-1840324437
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
-1608992654
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
-2017911903

-1840324437
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
2061093747

-1840324437
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
-1615103888
best earthly companion."
-846209231

-1840324437
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
581951211

-1840324437
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
461522260
too."
-1448595403

-1840324437
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
1232275295
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
-1232288407
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
1400708563
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
-801852380
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
-1984385576
said--
2060708905

-1840324437
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
1115250792

-1840324437
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
-1337071290
return."
1054377539

-1840324437
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
513564077

-1840324437
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
-779276680

-1840324437
"Come, Jane--come hither."
136459044

-1840324437
"Your bride stands between us."
713298132

-1840324437
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
1916207927

-1840324437
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
-1496605677
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
1703374739

-1840324437
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
771131165
was still incredulous.
-1987239734

-1840324437
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
-1122115858

-1840324437
"Entirely."
-404228021

-1840324437
"You have no faith in me?"
-6202327

-1840324437
"Not a whit."
-1414014556

-1840324437
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
1640939792
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
-818559574
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
-53888123
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
741365423
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
811043564
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
942475692
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
-1086219325
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
1496540708
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
1642665294

-1840324437
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
-2110780400
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
1363248812
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
1027182989
given me?"
-1390159890

-1840324437
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
681800334
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
-216876903

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
-1694238985

-1840324437
"Why?"
500216564

-1840324437
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
815922538

-1840324437
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
2022716398
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
-1620022866

-1840324437
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
363161178
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
-1170205493

-1840324437
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
2035186844
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
730183134

-1840324437
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
1131214163
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
423561106

-1840324437
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
1285517260
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
-2026464581

-1840324437
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
-224294220
be your wife?"
1014052917

-1840324437
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
550783717

-1840324437
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
-207799632

-1840324437
"Edward--my little wife!"
-1263527944

-1840324437
"Dear Edward!"
1682514171

-1840324437
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
-384642776
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
-624247850
happiness--I will make yours."
-1726891793

-1840324437
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
-737549077
have her, and will hold her."
1116167601

-1840324437
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
-665255845

-1840324437
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
-328404171
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
1716120986
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
1785228918
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
-2005131603
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
-261781134
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
-1320944219
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
593472894
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
-782172670
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
1555126819
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
636254034
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
-46606469

-1840324437
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
1466046130
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
1253119180
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
1783900742
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
-2003506313

-1840324437
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
847980538
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
1001211307

-1840324437
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
-1244927648
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
-597308316
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
851244826
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
180386938

-1840324437
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
925748002
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
-150816683
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
2049439799
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
-61215225
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
-891995743
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
-1958125591

-1840324437
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
-1922716796
night--good-night, my darling!"
1114573195

-1840324437
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
553064887
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
-1277106984
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
-263064231
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
-744336328
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
983092642
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
-1363859218
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
-423482982
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
1576341264
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
-397252037
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
589437836
strength for anything.
-29288552

-1840324437
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
-550183161
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
205183343
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
390111767

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXIV
-1647069851

-1840324437

-1840324437
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
1096587373
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
-749881113
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
-243966698

-1840324437
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
555358735
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
-1612249528
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
203012315
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
1375752077
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
1214357880
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
1451047126
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
1361894885
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
1139694906
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
-1888132278

-1840324437
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
-1489054720
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
641385113
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
1144877550
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
-542061247
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
1388265515
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
924358978
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
1611955334
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
-257207278
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
-8341728

-1840324437
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
1695106980
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
1716705454
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
-523304063
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
-15078405
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
-2017189259
schoolroom.
-765017805

-1840324437
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
-995338657

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
436294184

-1840324437
"Where is he?"
-94696930

-1840324437
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
-268695289
there he stood.
-891327105

-1840324437
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
-743336006
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
-894335098
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
-147691102
well loved, so caressed by him.
-735182817

-1840324437
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
1541466369
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
1764607634
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
-1720289979
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
-1097356197
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
-1166594437
new-dyed, I suppose.)
82776971

-1840324437
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
1736540539

-1840324437
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
-1287463334
more.  Do you hear that?"
-229191816

-1840324437
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
670513474
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
-779141809
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
-2076337118
think almost fear.
-324504579

-1840324437
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
1735711747

-1840324437
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
1174681560
strange."
-675688253

-1840324437
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
1144289750
Rochester's girl-bride."
-1266109282

-1840324437
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
-1287774102
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
1071707295
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
1358836228
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
-1458722117

-1840324437
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
-1073491676
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
63199938
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
-270202394
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
-1712151252
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
-1476519754

-1840324437
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
1296048202
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
-1857671099
have them."
1948394561

-1840324437
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
556337157
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
1131354974
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
969913774
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
-1385577455

-1840324437
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
82697110
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
-1857907732
Quakerish governess."
-1251345596

-1840324437
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
259970271
heart,--delicate and aerial."
-176702630

-1840324437
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
405301167
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
1371283906

-1840324437
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
-1139067818
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
880811115
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
-900217353
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
365659451
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
-416677736

-1840324437
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
562021212
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
1216688526
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
-1550369923
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
-1121662601
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
626550443
flatter me."
-206255534

-1840324437
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
-44718504
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
1668998840
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
5112948
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
1293007521
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
-159799504
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
835943976
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
-120043184
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
-1433667309
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
59548981

-1840324437
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
-1935217263

-1840324437
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
-979866036
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
1221147294
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
-875480696
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
1786953548
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
2110718783
as my comforter."
-1327065381

-1840324437
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
-760572109
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
2058557041
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
1302053024
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
858860735
anticipate."
-1593141572

-1840324437
"What do you anticipate of me?"
1942929458

-1840324437
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
132431478
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
-1136649415
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
232686011
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
1203667283
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
1593653217
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
489573438
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
501549117
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
531620922
dear master."
1451569922

-1840324437
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
166841145
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
1775904402
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
167819284

-1840324437
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
-1946507461

-1840324437
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
1717075562
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
99367315
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
-600834828
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
636495822
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
1054761210
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
-70162926

-1840324437
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
-647499228
such an one?"
621478686

-1840324437
"I love it now."
819071417

-1840324437
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
560940480
standard?"
-1666318681

-1840324437
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
98061932
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
1889422279
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
1799242681
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
404417579
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
1763284682
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
-1762095765
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
1974017818

-1840324437
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
-1846907531
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
699267021

-1840324437
"You were, you little elfish--"
-481872393

-1840324437
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
-2116360609
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
-24058905
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
-500624713
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
-506567995
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
-2035747020
pleasure to grant."
-1796741328

-1840324437
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
-506834294

-1840324437
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
-1420874069

-1840324437
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
-956624209
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
277133957

-1840324437
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
780239371
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
-2108695851
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
-1876796779

-1840324437
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
-881825045
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
-562878165
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
2101364887
withdrawn: try again."
1473857050

-1840324437
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
-2120412785
piqued on one point."
-2136179937

-1840324437
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
463058351
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
-23707071
request--"
1089604925

-1840324437
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
1546717751

-1840324437
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
-171784109
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
786960188

-1840324437
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
-1598040287
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
881184651
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
817402930
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
-1328100696

-1840324437
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
1387121407
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
-819875623
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
77740185

-1840324437
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
-904807205
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
-472718166
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
2088148918
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
-1392198985
of my power?"
-2089367677

-1840324437
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
2060161118
up."
-867082685

-1840324437
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
-304211379
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
2063909112
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
-813753450
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
1993577046

-1840324437
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
-1982473724
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
2105230532
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
-435358041

-1840324437
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
744960867
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
987765604
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
-944839300
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
-175248962

-1840324437
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
-1676489844
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
802046290
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
1770471528
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
1054723414
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
434529172
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
1615380660
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
-439704487
made me the offer."
-1696788090

-1840324437
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
1625806338

-1840324437
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
293671735
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
1123785369
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
-4066703

-1840324437
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
124677285
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
-1481186259
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
1720077744

-1840324437
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
791749455
Were you jealous, Jane?"
-162865113

-1840324437
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
632710393
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
-29379289
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
171535273
deserted?"
1726623038

-1840324437
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
467048988
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
-731781697
moment."
-518251521

-1840324437
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
1582103570
principles on some points are eccentric."
1124636733

-1840324437
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
-1417935628
awry for want of attention."
1981061192

-1840324437
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
-559957671
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
-1315283293
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
-809729881

-1840324437
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
2004205573
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
2100606433
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
-777804387

-1840324437
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
-779462981
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
-914382117
express.
430311250

-1840324437
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
-1818132545
entreated, and to yield."
-1983550104

-1840324437
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
-1335130588
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
231363999
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
-1201309796
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
213950357

-1840324437
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
-1470129735
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
-1670540321
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
1255001896
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
-1245689582

-1840324437
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
2118400152

-1840324437
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
1590872999
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
-1097387364

-1840324437
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
1844295648
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
-280761269
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
1036680810
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
-1795464246
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
-25157547
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
-823003314
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
1249605787
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
17035130
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
1981898984
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
-966904758

-1840324437
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
549837580
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
479679456
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
95981483
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
-1415194863
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
-1977333201
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
-1553836709
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
-981448148
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
469997727
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
546947002
you would be his wife."
1827451682

-1840324437
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
1421938189

-1840324437
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
507872054

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
-409682017
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
-2119206157
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
-649477406

-1840324437
"He tells me so."
262270641

-1840324437
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
-147550670
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
1091902700

-1840324437
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
1857716921
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
-724141141
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
754387122
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
-1279716877
father."
-76674663

-1840324437
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
-1646353082
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
1240380377
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
-1872833633
twenty."
-215833128

-1840324437
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
2045593168

-1840324437
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
1119866965
eyes.
1711648589

-1840324437
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
2106627916
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
976184784
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
762988344
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
-1917082580
I expect."
1421120900

-1840324437
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
-837926419
should have a sincere affection for me?"
1761180047

-1840324437
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
1363638739
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
1019375155
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
-1892914935
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
-1880384121
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
-774283290
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
-1945891523
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
1070493805
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
503036490
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
-1635144009
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
-224164643
him."
1894163625

-1840324437
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
-381779210
that all was right."
167508586

-1840324437
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
-1564283347
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
1339765442
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
-400752406
accustomed to marry their governesses."
1463588158

-1840324437
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
1403254539

-1840324437
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
1195323483
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
1897604521
me go mademoiselle."
1506017474

-1840324437
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
-599596456
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
1480799485
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
-1781227689
backwards and forwards.
950834788

-1840324437
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
1571811186

-1840324437
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
1168429741

-1840324437
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
-1535822518

-1840324437
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
31771472

-1840324437
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
321499247
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
-945468342
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
-248190974
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
734033365
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
1284833397
my face.
-934460363

-1840324437
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
1338510589
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
-1204572568

-1840324437
"I would far rather she went, sir."
1257456604

-1840324437
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
-845266842
to Adele.
-15479466

-1840324437
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
-1563199536

-1840324437
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
888961192
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
552411430
company--for life."
524815138

-1840324437
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
-293312961
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
813994144
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
-2010580330
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
-200913934
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
1455460659

-1840324437
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
-189512375
there is plenty of room on this side."
-980436929

-1840324437
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
-741561495
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
-200180737

-1840324437
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
-1802893607
mademoiselle?"
1928046783

-1840324437
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
-1742573419
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
534145241
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
-1950862747
there, and only me."
-886654115

-1840324437
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
1871062249

-1840324437
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
821736390
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
202801290

-1840324437
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
561340535

-1840324437
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
-1871767963
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
-814461067

-1840324437
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
335666311
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
-496945681

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
922248365
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
-1137386955
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
2000047207
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
582916328

-1840324437
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
-1129985658
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
-391741173
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
622713529

-1840324437
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
1310894559

-1840324437
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
1220984333
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
-1860555729

-1840324437
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
-2005454537
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
-1144897114
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
1693807206
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
-526860237

-1840324437
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
1021155657
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
-398122867
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
-784351159
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
1440147471
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
-105626710
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
1391800959
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
598692629
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
1173170408
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
-1879736169
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
-225243690
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
-1075365042
effect--
1717461424

-1840324437
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
-454234127
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
-1163144657
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
1007171435
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
1483842960
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
-457448365
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
1148409433

-1840324437
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
-745255800
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
-1421272753
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
50308912
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
723433351
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
1411298349
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
-329480184
again."
-610574896

-1840324437
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
497959538
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
612728042

-1840324437
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
-1673623453
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
165222735
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
-2092101733
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
662041383
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
1380349557
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
815584042
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
-834416871

-1840324437
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
1643237178
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
-427062442
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
1649524350
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
-1446140241
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
-2025705599
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
-1120758327
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
103317648
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
297457518
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
1441487519
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
1596401540
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
1792346030
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
-1346763964
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
12163293
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
-1602679201

-1840324437
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
-526752049
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
254538243
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
-1487658360
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
1535514350
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
1610082099
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
-630649283
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
-1630997017
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
1981816546
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
174680656
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
1829676310
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
-163522909
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
-1182701803
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
-1645837265
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
-1341523244
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
-733863679
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
-187558102
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
1280130118
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
1511614468
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
-765370197
passionate pressure.
77562626

-1840324437
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
-1210260216
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
414016539
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
-295074378
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
-443429969
satin."
1933498938

-1840324437
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
50275902
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
-1918840325
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
741683529
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
117222548

-1840324437
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
-1846005002
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
1657545232
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
-640024301
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
1898668650
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
2100621084
satisfactorily here."
-1393211788

-1840324437
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
-1424920479
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
2062755637

-1840324437
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
-634881214
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
-107047198
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
-1401031549
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
1151102673
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
-1363561407
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
1036715406

-1840324437
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
1383570328

-1840324437
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
-1668883662
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
-1163684358
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
-2067462595
would be to violate its conditions."
796833637

-1840324437
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
1068355807
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
1730507280
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
-994731573

-1840324437
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
-1292060136
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
-1642488747
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
164808551
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
-1114870725
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
-1553679781
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
1720412274

-1840324437
"Well, but what?"
1803349035

-1840324437
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
-1830130240

-1840324437
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
626548452
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
1693739083
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
-1723518828

-1840324437
"No, thank you, sir."
-1139637017

-1840324437
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
-272432117

-1840324437
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
1555700042
till--"
-274372176

-1840324437
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
-516412124

-1840324437
"Till I can't help it."
2000750105

-1840324437
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
1618956630
companion of my repast?"
-2035534902

-1840324437
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
445886980
usual for another month."
-32206895

-1840324437
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
386543689

-1840324437
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
1749867371
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
-412654040
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
-722998387
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
624913788

-1840324437
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
-785286407
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
295594967
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
1836638988
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
-1092628814
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
1698088000
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
425312044
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
458778978
my jewel I should tyne."
1663162256

-1840324437
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
1095792846
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
-1938311730
retreat upstairs.
-30932016

-1840324437
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
1261251478
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
-625601532
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
825713037
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
731815925
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
-201183208
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
1270660250
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
226951264
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
-112594173
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
-1931943541
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
1245839931
the present.
849379401

-1840324437
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
-1661049417

-1840324437
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
-895491318
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
-1032137799
stimulate it.
-56747994

-1840324437
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
439143433

-1840324437
"Very well, sir, I will try."
-1825584727

-1840324437
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
1080567368
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
-1646146444
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
-2056921185
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
785315378
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
890151033
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
-1043443792
strain:--
675727812

-1840324437
   "The truest love that ever heart
-208447278
      Felt at its kindled core,
1686224500
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
-1258406233
      The tide of being pour.
402873430

-1840324437
   Her coming was my hope each day,
1013348158
      Her parting was my pain;
-107402701
   The chance that did her steps delay
-106098956
      Was ice in every vein.
1524538736

-1840324437
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
2124235029
      As I loved, loved to be;
92414348
   And to this object did I press
-1513442760
      As blind as eagerly.
-219534309

-1840324437
   But wide as pathless was the space
-321575775
      That lay our lives between,
1151227818
   And dangerous as the foamy race
-1310492086
      Of ocean-surges green.
117242973

-1840324437
   And haunted as a robber-path
-1047220574
      Through wilderness or wood;
677277640
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
1068911985
      Between our spirits stood.
-330258167

-1840324437
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
322095854
      I omens did defy:
-1243961647
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
-1052070984
      I passed impetuous by.
-1588066471

-1840324437
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
-1824746934
      I flew as in a dream;
1855677067
   For glorious rose upon my sight
1730389638
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
1068802967

-1840324437
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
-419262381
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
1486100999
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
-253724422
      Disasters gather nigh.
-2092291561

-1840324437
   I care not in this moment sweet,
697821278
      Though all I have rushed o'er
817450136
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
-1248507442
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
527394380

-1840324437
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
-1491469921
      Right, bar approach to me,
-1932533247
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
948448202
      Swear endless enmity.
1689550506

-1840324437
   My love has placed her little hand
-35081057
      With noble faith in mine,
129946061
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
1657204029
      Our nature shall entwine.
1578038634

-1840324437
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
507158330
      With me to live--to die;
-1478205260
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
-323459657
      As I love--loved am I!"
174695197

-1840324437
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
853630383
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
-869268252
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
1367615740
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
379080935
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
1108372561
"whom he was going to marry now?"
-236557392

-1840324437
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
1824112745

-1840324437
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
162615426
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
921521350
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
1267572640

-1840324437
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
1134734260
Death was not for such as I."
703089178

-1840324437
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
1781616588
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
-839730258

-1840324437
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
1338516441
reconciling kiss?"
-1998746978

-1840324437
"No: I would rather be excused."
1425664378

-1840324437
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
1342510805
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
1249060685
stanzas crooned in her praise."
1410258158

-1840324437
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
-852008497
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
-1991018105
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
-1345332288
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
-1685269697
time to rescind it.
740375565

-1840324437
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
125215194

-1840324437
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
-1507831099
myself I was doing that now."
249702725

-1840324437
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
490330770
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
722790978
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
1486969127
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
1000068961
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
-106067293
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
249803386
advantage."
-1925170735

-1840324437
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
-29667503
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
804678699
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
-576716379
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
1176158024

-1840324437
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
-457850087
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
-1127606829
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
137475489
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
1494418030
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
352011626
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
770856308

-1840324437
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
775967759
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
349198423
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
-1892415274
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
-2045538344
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
823148765
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
214200208
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
1256499040
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
-15521923
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
1780989933
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
-494034161
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
51863504
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
-1186606983
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
1357692991
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
-2091910015
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
-344027494
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
1028676138
virtue, another must be devised."
-1176100797

-1840324437
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
625254559
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
-2140642531
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
421534513
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
1908381909
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
1847312484
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
413586635

-1840324437

-1840324437
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
945614285
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
-596648017
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
524325140
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
1254368842
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
1089730136
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
1393725712
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
-1699602544
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
800388753
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
609313809
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
-578507248
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
-127728657
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
-303870751
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
1084736301
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
-1998028230
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
1457512381
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
-635337020
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
917582462
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
1839780850
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
-723306250
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
-1679640625
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
-2060566601
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
-344292100
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
181604103

-1840324437
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
-137943164
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
-694070434
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
-2037985272
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
844022440
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
-2136835077
more than they.
-333394974

-1840324437
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
-401257281
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
372348044
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
-1283402270
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
1224688587
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
-387239198
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
-1364894450
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
1036607605
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
-325579495
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
-1756144969
to him, you shall share the confidence.
-1120694379

-1840324437
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
353426339
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
-1417356217
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
681482324
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
1278789684
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
55435513
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
-6262244
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
-959631840
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
401933031

-1840324437
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
-378513816
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
-1676448039
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
1426749105
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
-1205863581
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
1264210363
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
363838829
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
2002952669
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
1458566118
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
1819665990
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
1857934466

-1840324437
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
-1459701834
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
-1431996339
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
113617607
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
-1934889952
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
-1890125113
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
309917841
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
-163509942
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
1434566147
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
1318480852
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
-1475082811
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
-1862434265
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
-1888308014
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
141108749
listen to, and I ran off again.
2087750369

-1840324437
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
868754338
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
-1550003811
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
-181656326
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
-978712942
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
-1261613730
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
20935044
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
-1151010389
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
-1778362825
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
-598807752
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
563824908
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
-757603056
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
1876739872
simultaneously struck ten.
-1963305305

-1840324437
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
-671042749
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
809708467
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
865431608

-1840324437
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
423618796
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
1031823710
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
-1463391225
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
-523208907
by one moving speck.
313040695

-1840324437
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
1808549457
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
-1448159001
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
-1921780496
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
-1440326316

-1840324437
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
-749390465
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
2117020126
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
-110186167
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
-1889479298
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
-1235700801
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
-698231530
meridian, and must now decline.
1203835805

-1840324437
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
1946421402
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
-574529770
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
-1837900123

-1840324437
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
-1902326365
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
-349998272
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
-429199679
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
1521013588
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
2139799130
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
-273955172

-1840324437
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
801267352
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
1785651548
give me both hands: mount!"
-1147049330

-1840324437
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
-1808645453
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
1684088018
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
-935452616
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
971853269
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
-745800746

-1840324437
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
-1921688256
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
-2137223059

-1840324437
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
1984635138
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
607901803
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
459619397

-1840324437
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
-1908668150

-1840324437
"Then you have been both?"
-217879435

-1840324437
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
397610473
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
-671999336

-1840324437
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
-1977582837
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
-829598210
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
2117741223
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
969263376
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
-1065811916
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
-469697488

-1840324437
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
-273584317
get down."
1627991672

-1840324437
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
971482831
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
-1493967055
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
-362292519
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
-1272587520
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
133658896

-1840324437
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
512467650
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
-1999952104

-1840324437
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
-865434671
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
-316327435
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
510021386

-1840324437
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
146093950
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
-916530990

-1840324437
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
1415603891

-1840324437
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
1568429088

-1840324437
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
-45319335
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
-513662641
as a long, strong arm.
-691880547

-1840324437
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
-458137439
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
1442448825

-1840324437
"Yes, Jane."
-51121087

-1840324437
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
-601642643
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
-2138766631

-1840324437
"It is near midnight," I said.
-1087001648

-1840324437
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
-2056522165
my wedding."
-1694496589

-1840324437
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
-506073236
no wish to go to bed."
1181190112

-1840324437
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
-1421023656

-1840324437
"All, sir."
-794200750

-1840324437
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
1466403052
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
-1011192528
from church."
-1828250882

-1840324437
"Very well, sir."
1766879345

-1840324437
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
-1197362007
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
-954113828
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
496956519

-1840324437
"I believe I am."
-1608079675

-1840324437
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
263782524

-1840324437
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
-802299729
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
-1022962829
charged?"
1646559072

-1840324437
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
-32657838
over-fatigued."
517316434

-1840324437
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
-942451025

-1840324437
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
776059290

-1840324437
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
613058891
and flushed.
-1109950462

-1840324437
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
-1169075225
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
1978433983
I shall not prove a good husband?"
627413624

-1840324437
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
-1912500245

-1840324437
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
-292671779
new life into which you are passing?"
2006146714

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
-1492949584
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
-1668862923

-1840324437
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
-1387264719

-1840324437
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
-656168255
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
-351510107
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
423760974
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
-845973789
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
-470520829

-1840324437
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
1320509285
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
-90755523
proceeded.
-1641045730

-1840324437
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
-1280236316
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
-1697796066
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
-1370968696
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
724140330
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
-8551236
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
-234506488
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
1888423641
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
-838066060
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
632979116
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
-1771924480
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
1413208940
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
-1795106267
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
652594229
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
-1152074086
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
-1998805540
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
-280547020
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
1534372610
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
-2047516997
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
645889147
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
-1928768098
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
-774289673
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
1071245625
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
1655041228
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
1571638465
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
163089123
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
1923211213
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
-669170005
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
-1892161013
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
1910545595
coronet."
228430720

-1840324437
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
-1743623535
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
21095236
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
844309992

-1840324437
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
656646018
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
1525056502
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
-1740692690
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
950577976
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
740578804
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
-212157275
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
-1085096240
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
-892334375
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
1958066461
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
-1821048442
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
-1408829637
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
1832757270
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
-1602484746
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
-2110345529
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
-2135175529
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
-1198172916
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
-594671844
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
-881656428
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
-428476289
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
-480802773
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
-1366000280
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
538979547
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
468868902
moment."
-518251521

-1840324437
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
-1800271146
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
-1706443115
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
-1463851919
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
-1224423419
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
-994050181
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
-1722132218
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
-467159138
Jane?--repeat it."
1603488369

-1840324437
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
894769626

-1840324437
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
-129893614
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
-2082847799
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
-1208559742
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
-1705360499
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
1214423753
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
228624554
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
-2039208961
incensed than saddened."
-824762434

-1840324437
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
-112811444
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
-361386662

-1840324437
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
1161818777
of your melancholy in a dream."
-260987257

-1840324437
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
799065134
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
-1730953474

-1840324437
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
-1958391082
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
-1688650646

-1840324437
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
-1153790988
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
-1186079798
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
583920184
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
493797703
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
-2075470938
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
-368682819
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
966628768
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
1628025038
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
-516402883
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
-1354236263
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
344085154
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
1842028253
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
1915763546
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
1437697676
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
-1128656666
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
1061399703
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
1887083247
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
1865315720
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
1829428942
woke."
-570764738

-1840324437
"Now, Jane, that is all."
1562966032

-1840324437
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
-1389146016
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
-1552027906
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
-592882277
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
1750069629
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
-1926360998
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
-1240857841
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
460521534
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
-825008240
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
-1019960236
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
549649116
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
1723465562
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
815324810
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
-1777884345

-1840324437
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
-725944231

-1840324437
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
352357950
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
882878113
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
1229813100

-1840324437
"Describe it, Jane."
-1563492985

-1840324437
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
-1399482419
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
-488958682
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
905176878

-1840324437
"Did you see her face?"
1195509089

-1840324437
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
250158360
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
-721132703
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
-2064845083
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
91558624

-1840324437
"And how were they?"
-7883509

-1840324437
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
-1040721621
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
1598215193
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
174243080

-1840324437
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
1841414407

-1840324437
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
1155218672
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
1866168210
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
1462222708

-1840324437
"You may."
-539962813

-1840324437
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
-1512670974

-1840324437
"Ah!--what did it do?"
-343179683

-1840324437
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
-332156451
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
2099822492

-1840324437
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
1103825936
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
614239524

-1840324437
"Afterwards?"
-401118348

-1840324437
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
-1042149758
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
1022645715
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
-1525740039
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
-1259716201
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
-465119437
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
-1292274180
from terror."
-705600225

-1840324437
"Who was with you when you revived?"
-734096128

-1840324437
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
1205439228
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
-1539832904
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
980070053
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
1316980188

-1840324437
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
1754636866
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
198105950
handling."
-699055827

-1840324437
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
-1552663693
transaction actually took place."
-594120786

-1840324437
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
150696351
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
-1451623190
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
759209802

-1840324437
"Not yet."
1539244519

-1840324437
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
-57112159
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
-478971127
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
701046508

-1840324437
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
100550677
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
-799235384
mystery of that awful visitant."
1137789807

-1840324437
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
-1407923599

-1840324437
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
-1602989864
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
-1680348990
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
-270019977
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
455022381
to bottom in two halves!"
-119657417

-1840324437
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
-203751114
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
-1661917101
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
874308396
might have happened!"
907051431

-1840324437
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
-2133159138
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
101717155

-1840324437
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
-898623739
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
140199098
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
-65906792
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
-796895126
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
2082893841
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
1853704707
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
415985173
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
-1145255610
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
-441038107
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
922594734
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
-1467403372
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
642219390
solution of the mystery?"
-680483584

-1840324437
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
-1934831552
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
-40230950
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
607851512
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
1855014152

-1840324437
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
-1492708513
candle.
298803196

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
-42586737
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
1203335721
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
-1547501988
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
-1586380604

-1840324437
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
774035412

-1840324437
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
-757076803
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
-2018303395
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
-798293906
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
-816966651
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
274414400
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
-1967800884
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
1327639894

-1840324437
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
-1306545919
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
2063468521
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
-698356224

-1840324437
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
-181210622
Janet now?"
1047605021

-1840324437
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
1640389026

-1840324437
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
-1215493279
love and blissful union."
282134345

-1840324437
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
-363050286
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
1411477372
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
1972259698
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
2139131220
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
1203596785
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
1244461251
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
1215806404
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
1990336347
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
-1550671245
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
-793908201
day.
-1415695375

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXVI
-1158670546

-1840324437

-1840324437
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
-2013218411
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
954932674
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
432973274
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
-2139254046
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
-1203160979

-1840324437
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
-1667722077
not taken one peep."
-248725265

-1840324437
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
752262375
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
-894904780
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
-1534757022
by Mr. Rochester.
2114498208

-1840324437
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
1289892809
so long!"
987871716

-1840324437
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
354517077
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
-1803864784
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
-1423987526
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
609198372
footman, answered it.
-854271879

-1840324437
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
-95701818

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Is the luggage brought down?"
1077471536

-1840324437
"They are bringing it down, sir."
-565009410

-1840324437
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
997696916
there: return and tell me."
253241340

-1840324437
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
-773804526
footman soon returned.
847913713

-1840324437
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
-860806891

-1840324437
"And the carriage?"
-697255653

-1840324437
"The horses are harnessing."
810136394

-1840324437
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
-798956467
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
-40999374
coachman in his seat."
162946661

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Jane, are you ready?"
-1649464396

-1840324437
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
-1183510750
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
1542432324
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
524517768
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
407778934
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
-872344266
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
1675276142
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
729668612
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
-742081688
and flashing eyes.
1522945093

-1840324437
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
1363498053
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
-828156182
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
1936476899
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
-1492286335
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
-988340385
seemed breasting and resisting.
-1920282219

-1840324437
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
-2078444318
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
733811811
me, Jane."
2075010472

-1840324437
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
-286073383
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
-489984289
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
-765968311
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
1504416221
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
-1813685237
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
-54630330
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
66853982
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
1808642726
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
-1345500629
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
362687109
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
-1482072933
path to the porch.
456028110

-1840324437
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
64769932
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
770249074
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
1871126938
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
-2031618338
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
2012306676
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
724694688
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
-1143310315
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
240452574

-1840324437
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
1822215595
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
-556503462
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
-76013687
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
796248538
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
652355427
Rochester, went on.
-1023711146

-1840324437
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
797743011
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
2039036607
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
-1048815364
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
112271847
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
71762587
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
-5309685

-1840324437
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
289396115
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
-1968613619
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
-732048854
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
-1631735662
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
-831271764
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
194142039

-1840324437
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
1192785762

-1840324437
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
682316245
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
1884392889
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
579312991
said, "Proceed."
-147288754

-1840324437
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
-969667874
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
-1487017195

-1840324437
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
706014830
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
927564371

-1840324437
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
-194968685
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
1345370832
marriage exists."
-1469420598

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
-2003895223
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
440333039
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
1269708018
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
2001328722
beneath!
-1467840422

-1840324437
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
-422480550
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
1639365120

-1840324437
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
-518604520
advisedly."
1397028206

-1840324437
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
1170223831
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
980526531

-1840324437
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
-1173222833
Rochester has a wife now living."
-2065961090

-1840324437
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
-625392326
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
798427201
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
-497481318
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
-988658153
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
1017842220
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
-696644906
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
1569459064
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
552139226

-1840324437
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
-1862562888

-1840324437
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
2060509573

-1840324437
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
225663217

-1840324437
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
-422618671
recognises, if you do not."
-132468992

-1840324437
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
312247246
place of abode."
479603271

-1840324437
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
1476213138
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
1965274182

-1840324437
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
-624222065
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
1763749677
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
1582952570
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
1995541755
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
462941689
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
-234769949
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
-160194185
Mason.'"
366395579

-1840324437
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
225083150
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
1759632000

-1840324437
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
1708936514

-1840324437
"How do you know?"
-348242592

-1840324437
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
1322758746
scarcely controvert."
-642352029

-1840324437
"Produce him--or go to hell."
1149311459

-1840324437
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
-298452501
goodness to step forward."
1480933122

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
-104898736
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
1678374929
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
-1567187781
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
-475447779
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
-1482209114
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
-992208950
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
-201831676
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
-1186095602
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
72636013
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
-1544629237
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
1507653254
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
-1101189651
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
752054086
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
-625297408

-1840324437
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
-978167465

-1840324437
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
-1826868932
what have you to say?"
-1976096532

-1840324437
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
308838145
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
713253815
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
1100319928

-1840324437
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
-406825640

-1840324437
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
1154409421
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
1747450409

-1840324437
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
-1358289069
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
759191709
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
-1389512857

-1840324437
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
1396530214

-1840324437
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
-673093339
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
875537243
formed his resolve, and announced it--
-434865777

-1840324437
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
-50114439
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
456844307
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
954806293
obeyed.
252277758

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
839919452
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
1475913032
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
-899895379
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
1761152077
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
1719395528
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
2110142852
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
-2142264801
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
-1295802270
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
-286425191
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
323106165
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
-1566566162
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
-1705123460
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
-1641370118
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
506273263
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
1210395316
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
-1675800783
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
-2076469840
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
-1639971460
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
1077159980
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
218332589
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
959151575
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
72656037
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
-1932104743
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
1672666552
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
-1551536389
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
556327827
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
286021855
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
-34459943
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
843114558
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
22109297
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
1557008271
you--follow!"
1895625889

-1840324437
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
2023488401
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
-1012266332

-1840324437
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
35140070
will not be wanted to-day."
485554668

-1840324437
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
723217746
greet us.
-808810294

-1840324437
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
412062060
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
-508656963
late!"
1506690374

-1840324437
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
-301856603
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
1401215048
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
-1670708330
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
-106912826
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
142087898

-1840324437
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
1896862301
here."
-113865861

-1840324437
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
312090857
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
2036807459
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
-1911607551
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
492691147
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
-1690666495
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
191309498
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
1938324112
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
2142401248
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
-174785868
mane, hid its head and face.
1200232042

-1840324437
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
-1124136291
your charge to-day?"
178848494

-1840324437
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
1081352468
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
346521658

-1840324437
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
-1146633770
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
-262169977

-1840324437
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
-2064591663

-1840324437
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
1563358078

-1840324437
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
-1087907767

-1840324437
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
700342222
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
1716114014
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
374558039

-1840324437
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
-1206574501
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
-104878259

-1840324437
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
1227035285
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
-1888380818

-1840324437
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
16676937

-1840324437
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
-1392370414

-1840324437
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
364209337
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
458898471
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
3256653
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
-888975492
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
-823256205
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
-1400419939
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
-1950487561
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
-27671297
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
2145776533
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
1678727555
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
-1926396991
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
1878255627

-1840324437
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
-352948580
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
-1181958003
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
-38820249
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
1574753306
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
974908493
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
-783289286
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
-1347983374
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
936330079
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
691279686
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
1138429116

-1840324437
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
-1026122638
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
-2015169293
the stair.
-182373040

-1840324437
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
1220645897
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
1002571010
returns to Madeira."
-1558423019

-1840324437
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
1649962106

-1840324437
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
-1084183667
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
-273736129
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
2057510124
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
-852719113
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
-805646185
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
508367411
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
-1542283057
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
2015488775
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
-1474444763
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
-1261430140
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
-1528378721
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
1317695600
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
1557676534
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
-1666369421
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
1563044404
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
1622341460
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
1323436443
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
-913802306
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
-934466715

-1840324437
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
-740368137
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
-790893576
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
-346054844
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
1294861032

-1840324437
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
819901959
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
474717701
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
238941569
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
50720195
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
-1640400895
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
-1138663098
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
-1270055281
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
685451450
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
-2043131011
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
-967915197

-1840324437
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
-74768250
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
-1808819658
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
-1770864834
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
-1704013815
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
-54024589
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
1597640602
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
1600705359
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
-2023423740

-1840324437
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
1031366421
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
-422034307
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
-1262581755
prospects?
1220873675

-1840324437
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
-1179003984
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
-865985115
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
657221920
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
-1857740560
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
18534376
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
-1436423161
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
-1026695057
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
1263957270
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
-1340733793
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
517955545
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
-2037625017
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
1549673533
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
-104913851
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
-263823859
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
-501866729
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
837936631
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
801453233
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
1608642165
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
-171926032
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
257099781
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
-2123926670
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
-1668734122
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
-1465742750
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
-759336575
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
16508967
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
932300958
conduct!
-548815463

-1840324437
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
-1096463898
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
1985017039
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
-1784602201
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
870471589
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
-848132463
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
-827149092
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
1177285376
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
-1093410234
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
-686359709

-1840324437
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
-395667458

-1840324437
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
2129301109
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
-1043956444
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
1402518034
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
541115332
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
37972983
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
-1492732323
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
-365651192
floods overflowed me."
-1268740520

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXVII
-1890343594

-1840324437

-1840324437
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
409318194
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
-1527541650
"What am I to do?"
485812238

-1840324437
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
1874672685
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
464663890
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
214164142
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
-1296537917
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
275658548
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
16024212
cannot do it."
-118937942

-1840324437
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
-57752996
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
289072489
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
1037829337
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
2027317868
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
-311369387
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
709407985
depths of agony.
784438563

-1840324437
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
-942290943

-1840324437
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
-191604904
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
-102403639
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
1558858489

-1840324437
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
-1699253846
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
-595719286
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
-838187508
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
-718998490
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
-1514124419
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
1917441276
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
1316178731
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
628755601
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
766149980
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
-484017872
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
674935577
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
-1208005305
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
635974447
threshold.
-965172434

-1840324437
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
-837575035
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
1071062847
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
2127430736
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
-1139900210
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
-730711253
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
680034871
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
-1875952874
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
-286831572
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
1202322679
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
-2094613430

-1840324437
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
1088476612
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
-322555671
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
-1256285947

-1840324437
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
864432197
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
798135954
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
-1762699981
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
-1770273206
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
812581474

-1840324437
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
1105628337
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
-1712507404
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
-1117294806
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
53735571
heart's core.
1243773729

-1840324437
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
-1529809642
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
259833964
the result rather of weakness than of will.
-221047814

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
-403434722

-1840324437
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
-1338597158
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
-2045322009
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
-171351569
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
-808046738
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
225441249
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
1437325754
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
-64798142
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
-1441425890
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
1394014924
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
1416277899
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
1627683427
him."
1894163625

-1840324437
"How are you now, Jane?"
-1552190010

-1840324437
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
1782387621

-1840324437
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
-268890547

-1840324437
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
1262873436
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
-831548076
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
1556122407
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
28117984
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
-411335930
put his aside.
314813648

-1840324437
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
-1765549371
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
1871699357
appropriated?"
-1457472126

-1840324437
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
-2140548548

-1840324437
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
1171318286
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
-1145527731
rightly?"
-1371894604

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
298861648
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
-1768706321
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
-63783306
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
129976118
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
-1804863491
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
509438240
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
1402395522
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
-590947152
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
571442605
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
-1749418935
know you--I am on my guard."
1104719166

-1840324437
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
204254121
warned me to curtail my sentence.
-1596328683

-1840324437
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
-924087916
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
1057120495
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
2063470647
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
1062348072
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
-1634984436
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
6784936
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
-111049590
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
-628129316

-1840324437
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
1913609390
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
-1954326764
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
-2060131065
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
1968902737

-1840324437
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
839212201
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
-623235008
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
-912581677
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
-899384693
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
-863849906
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
-1336345834
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
-1656146434
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
796111688
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
-733035326
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
-458217940
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
-1729847351
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
522156362
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
-1051225916
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
-479757384
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
-1934745383
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
-1688647075
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
-121673076
assassination, even of what I most hate.
-1440013596

-1840324437
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
-1986426094
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
1479841606
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
-836099480
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
-173312278
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
1714019354
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
1145958778
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
1455039693
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
1358412417
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
-395045914
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
1808413069

-1840324437
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
70775320
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
-563305167
cannot help being mad."
-1456194954

-1840324437
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
1207450575
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
-1166704353
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
952461494

-1840324437
"I do indeed, sir."
-516520902

-1840324437
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
1126107603
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
451997729
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
1194795635
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
1241757910
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
-1142986772
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
-471746134
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
-910365841
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
-806118524
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
-786660050
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
-2043491411
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
-639253753
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
-1020451020
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
1516161009
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
-2092412273
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
-325967653
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
1873837157
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
1948252055
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
850372301
falsehood and slander."
186755493

-1840324437
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
-1493796559
for you."
1432986497

-1840324437
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
-1010973578
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
1594150802
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
-135007015
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
991127428

-1840324437
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
-561937575
too dull for you."
-661365627

-1840324437
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
-1643874101
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
1743413554
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
-1907001396

-1840324437
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
-765673592
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
1639764132
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
1893177200
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
589598513
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
741296426

-1840324437
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
-1393185967
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
1506102216
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
-2055973883
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
-2047173412
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
-1457814699
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
1494369338

-1840324437
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
1544223229
before me.
-1650124957

-1840324437
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
343675631
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
-405441836
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
283464453
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
-1124329894
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
-1510805769
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
-264780777
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
-1825731997
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
-470675158
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
-495150098
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
-1884727903
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
1789793712
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
294234161
soothingly--
1761142867

-1840324437
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
-859028839
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
1874205004

-1840324437
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
1821106816
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
-350586149
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
-723468673
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
-1944053275
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
947613007
heartily.
1640892310

-1840324437
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
-1671039503
not while he was in such a passion.
1592841228

-1840324437
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
-931572605
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
2009451002
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
1886658180

-1840324437
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
1690752362
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
-1554951607
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
251646275

-1840324437
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
-594863066
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
1982092065
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
-1788560311
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
1216277626
were some toad or ape."
-2053362305

-1840324437
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
188365071
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
-47681255
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
299134854
where I had wounded.
1418986120

-1840324437
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
1201315516
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
1471466476

-1840324437
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
-1170955204
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
-678756296

-1840324437
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
926204128
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
1075322434

-1840324437
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
1191185928

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
-2028525059

-1840324437
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
1081900209
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
2131092975

-1840324437
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
1284002106
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
1900913379
scenes."
654926140

-1840324437
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
-923481552
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
-2013950166
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
-212209687
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
379441156
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
353872288
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
-1553825912
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
-233747225
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
1463748033
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
611772411
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
865767259

-1840324437
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
-1865230020
still I dared to speak.
-929689409

-1840324437
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
353688859
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
1550376757
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
-1008214956

-1840324437
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
526170761
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
-1374830542
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
-329917167

-1840324437
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
-298659877
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
37423339
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
534274272
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
644861566
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
967706934
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
1109290789

-1840324437
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
27857602
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
153789748
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
275383779
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
828005551
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
1761693242
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
1688091755
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
-187961958
case.  Can you listen to me?"
-1609900897

-1840324437
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
-470194232

-1840324437
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
1983661138
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
1558448919

-1840324437
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
-983106279

-1840324437
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
-167535078

-1840324437
"I have understood something to that effect."
456442336

-1840324437
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
-644977097
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
-1439802983
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
-706858877
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
1622336953
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
848455561
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
690843846
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
1337509651
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
1652440146
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
-1968488620
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
-952141793
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
-1576146467
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
-748728231
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
1443036898
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
-143675581
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
1267509363
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
1175025131
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
-713114513
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
-1388044482
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
1219855126
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
234016141
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
811499203
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
-1736784660
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
-1345319049
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
-180340965
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
-1335505146
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
251403423
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
-1967476222
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
-759483030
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
61823137
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
-770960467
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
1672208893
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
1325379999

-1840324437
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
1218717365
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
-691472639
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
1872840498
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
-1929235114
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
818679662
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
-1096831687
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
1941103633
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
-881390642
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
1996695648
plot against me."
68349813

-1840324437
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
-1758743431
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
111665225
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
-1201018740
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
-596706611
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
-250426417
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
25212478
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
438184994
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
76738049
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
1436665875
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
-802708249
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
-1367988347
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
1502141309
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
-1172957667
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
679844707
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
-326810828

-1840324437
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
230739189
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
163973833
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
-767262589
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
1165376550
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
-334670371
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
-441131722
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
-1654861421
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
-1586144461
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
1449096515
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
-2012296563

-1840324437
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
-1810322586
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
1200950856
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
1607388912
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
-311299640
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
2023413063
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
-1396981795
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
2077405651
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
2029369747

-1840324437
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
-438239497

-1840324437
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
-616461510
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
-1954813757
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
1363691754
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
-1407827596
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
-773210013
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
1321749770
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
-667372005
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
-1416903705
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
1176327146
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
697222182
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
1146457849

-1840324437
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
-1215825688

-1840324437
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
151149010
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
27615358
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
-131089905
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
489513689
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
1398351750
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
-266940519
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
1387988142
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
703997146
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
-2011422231
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
168351646
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
-415766623
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
1510416501
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
567507479
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
1775321636

-1840324437
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
-1092523120
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
638574328
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
-1107055276
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
-445040551
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
1721129844
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
-2129378221
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
90357093
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
899523758
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
234354567
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
-300555428
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
1129362098
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
-1228665708
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
-1572992337
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
-536264809
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
-1352797403
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
-1296250657

-1840324437
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
980440261
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
-167713100
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
-1250999799
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
-1623563943
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
2098897902
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
-807460549

-1840324437
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
239060652
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
-920046222
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
532198563
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
-1595647725
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
265529780

-1840324437
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
-1883476636
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
-1776201241
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
844104290
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
-1648061077
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
1939548411
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
1452720824
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
831936703
follow.
2013951061

-1840324437
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
1437283082
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
1910068983
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
-1420206590
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
1346574746
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
-87731169
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
-70252900
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
1400551099

-1840324437
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
-38096471
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
-1035958932
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
-466192090
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
-588538857
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
1164289207
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
-903712672
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
1017423670
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
-1625924986
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
-369310819
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
371564974
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
-748850447
and leave her.'
-1321920891

-1840324437
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
-591090396
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
-677168631
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
1738079818
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
107467573
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
1919043817
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
-999286109
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
-1926787310
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
1077948362
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
-1289825312

-1840324437
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
1203946048
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
1499807937
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
-1083336365
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
-2068493056
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
-1093440609
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
167150648
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
1050937833
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
-1414840568
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
-470193688
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
-1715322359
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
-1431537101
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
-1111347441
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
-11729968
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
288637788
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
1503025599
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
-844402398
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
943481734
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
1532531653
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
1491534759
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
1691240391
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
-1154634793
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
182845528
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
1950398804
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
-600708469
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
-1250090589
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
-1123684237
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
-1678431496

-1840324437
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
-42261665
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
1209734543

-1840324437
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
1329389904
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
430303225
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
-123066487
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
872750342
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
262530800

-1840324437
"But you could not marry, sir."
177511573

-1840324437
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
367370158
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
1373196862
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
1073279266
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
-1298346815
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
-1566683615
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
-782166042
burdened."
-1395733899

-1840324437
"Well, sir?"
849137291

-1840324437
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
1905926294
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
-782011533
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
-249070920
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
-1787865347
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
-709874299
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
-1609915336
don't very well know why."
-1194891313

-1840324437
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
-1608055205

-1840324437
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
1990699598

-1840324437
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
643208347
and what she said."
1789101500

-1840324437
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
-1516945743
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
-2094861678
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
-1450273202
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
1201484833
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
1570474313
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
273120170
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
1053134082
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
-353157848
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
542027118
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
1898661938
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
-1427000693
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
1854134588
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
1412942440
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
-1976563188
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
1813192149
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
-1575369297
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
464291763
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
2043959968
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
701586168
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
-371713843

-1840324437
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
275105590
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
-297422638
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
-1966292213
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
8391628
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
-1006704587
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
-414693210
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
1286745276
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
60240086
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
1876568197
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
590211250
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
1503269938
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
-239913926

-1840324437
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
545766817
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
281582121
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
-648443137

-1840324437
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
-187566039
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
1972335308
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
-1476924481
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
323945690
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
422006247
Giacinta, and Clara."
326542015

-1840324437
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
200413078
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
-553561439
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
-2059327403
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
792051821
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
1515294635
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
-891348923
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
1857045713
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
1155502957

-1840324437
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
998277487
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
952412254
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
-594168775
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
255799296
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
-940553350
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
944750782
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
-1257447948
back to England.
-666506648

-1840324437
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
73017400
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
395964724
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
-729461173
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
-189062002
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
1321793357
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
-1931696577
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
2085713336
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
944924494
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
-2010097297
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
-60168019
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
-1038019650
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
-1452001266

-1840324437
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
1358050850
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
-926248618
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
1661908646
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
-2013547728
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
-166585372
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
1102542510
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
43524445
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
-1545572529
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
-1687742110
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
-535650159
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
1306729208
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
-631850777
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
-96954585
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
-916139722
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
-1070655522
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
461907211
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
537105197
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
1859767565
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
-144761051
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
-137401524
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
72224507
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
2064799581
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
-1706003299
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
-1153471173
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
1240528254
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
-988293234
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
1153988814
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
-398723725
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
-994117129
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
1317913845
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
-259019935
out of my sight.
988803377

-1840324437
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
1137581145
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
14485723
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
294930517
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
-1824845013
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
-1762345380
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
-381770492
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
-2019072688
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
-1481029192
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
255519634
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
-1761326247
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
1000364903
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
-1239531775
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
-1665383946
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
-610757675
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
-28693173
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
1890308583
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
841436477
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
-1546421614
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
414915887
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
-434138327
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
-272213685
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
-1721074716
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
1058832970
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
709610956
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
1757642819
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
-431523335
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
1592238365
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
381098227
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
1112946633
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
1389821370
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
-408704483
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
108680249
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
-762039427
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
1212161006

-1840324437
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
-1017694601
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
-153237969
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
-344406671
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
1854799484
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
2044740741
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
-2022260364
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
1850278160
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
32239071
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
1270734011
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
385493230
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
962238834
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
-1759765818
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
-1785017766
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
-1054592736

-1840324437
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
590245280
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
-2040645773
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
-279058610
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
-101119529

-1840324437
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
179837745
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
-9029121

-1840324437
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
-439421677

-1840324437
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
-475984543
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
978172171
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
560999641
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
1800200893
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
-1977755433
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
1068071154
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
121706731
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
-355794694

-1840324437
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
-809106201
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
-2096237069
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
-71632347
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
-1374612421
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
2132172100
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
1313543512
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
-970615533
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
50844432
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
-106445474
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
132145176
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
662177930
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
385870177

-1840324437
A pause.
-1682144522

-1840324437
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
275166437

-1840324437
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
100912242
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
-1424066988
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
-1857674590
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
-1787294073
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
1690629329

-1840324437
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
-654720417
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
-1362965604

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
-2120562452

-1840324437
Another long silence.
1211271094

-1840324437
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
-1452612177
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
-2075882155
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
354248114
and to let me go another?"
-835176010

-1840324437
"I do."
1339324478

-1840324437
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
-1846362996

-1840324437
"I do."
1339324478

-1840324437
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
-336649313

-1840324437
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
-1613207833

-1840324437
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
34719095
to love me."
-1458916260

-1840324437
"It would to obey you."
-2007826439

-1840324437
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
-1345887921
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
-1479637129
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
-127434465

-1840324437
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
908979080
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
2005175499
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
1048468497
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
-529333474
companion and for some hope?"
-1616614213

-1840324437
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
368587769
again there."
1700213489

-1840324437
"Then you will not yield?"
-1945170089

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
1032848920
rose.
1693007528

-1840324437
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
-1646861426

-1840324437
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
1015834284
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
1721517951

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
2071884046
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
-1988371738
will forget me before I forget you."
1791548507

-1840324437
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
1758763420
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
-194231920
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
652255668
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
-1692398804
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
2129750554
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
1939327266
by living with me?"
646218248

-1840324437
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
1745207660
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
-2118167724
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
98101958
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
-1084855398
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
-846779830
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
-1249845781
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
178983210
who will be injured by what you do?"
1708972264

-1840324437
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
2110900699
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
813842505
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
-1907272330
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
-1830727294
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
1180398875
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
142107431
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
-378448942
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
1223556001
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
1245478008
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
-274030536
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
-694118261
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
-2124899846
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
-1178261563

-1840324437
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
1213373904
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
-67892500
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
2007420829
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
-119730563
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
761476337
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
1219594767
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
-485214160
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
-886914240
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
1372648711
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
-1966677886
strength almost exhausted.
579274473

-1840324437
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
264856073
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
-1539341919
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
-2084253894
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
-1117894387
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
-254091860
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
-815670514
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
-1769997379
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
1952944008
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
-1452940988
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
-302592283
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
-916062348
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
-1410271397
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
-1892290691
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
142235772
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
1603792341

-1840324437
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
1012622096
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
2127176533
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
354957146
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
1409325008

-1840324437
"You are going, Jane?"
-578425842

-1840324437
"I am going, sir."
-2031074628

-1840324437
"You are leaving me?"
-1081962658

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
-1172990268
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
2030398062

-1840324437
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
-1817996401
firmly, "I am going."
-1916209554

-1840324437
"Jane!"
857528667

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester!"
-1812005112

-1840324437
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
-503796256
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
-1041679641
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
-1126363618

-1840324437
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
1391782132
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
405491010
deep, strong sob.
1721270035

-1840324437
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
-1785772542
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
-1728934680
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
-1283787615
hand.
-2046500439

-1840324437
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
1545783298
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
-1322383160
me."
-909033979

-1840324437
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
-313422740
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
1147957291
yes--nobly, generously."
459079528

-1840324437
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
-1263921204
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
976077509
once quitted the room.
1802663752

-1840324437
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
1781392641
"Farewell for ever!"
-2031098249

-1840324437
* * * * *
597469952

-1840324437
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
1681851898
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
2074192092
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
1617163410
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
-1694855413
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
-63451730
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
1542518372
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
1995423184
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
-450934713
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
947354835
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
-1582688204
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
706915652
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
-800703060
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
1123080353
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
-432956484
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
426409530

-1840324437
"My daughter, flee temptation."
-775699685

-1840324437
"Mother, I will."
-1732210699

-1840324437
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
-586618668
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
-2081588863
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
1147333671
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
1085754205
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
-1475564318
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
586791324
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
-1397900672
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
-1499100390
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
-743280339
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
-1943947022
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
1786130796
from my room.
-886644206

-1840324437
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
1739631508
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
123903803
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
-1775810354
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
-1353167503

-1840324437
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
1430503964
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
36006965
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
443538198
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
589930980
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
1737970234
to go in and to say--
1771851627

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
-863535821
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
-1271474522
this.
-952403038

-1840324437
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
540019322
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
1426028567
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
584703582
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
-383661824
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
517860785
on.
1584696940

-1840324437
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
-1886175900
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
-653414524
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
-1570077894
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
1614048757
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
2021124701
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
762080720
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
-1009456283
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
448980132
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
1789715918

-1840324437
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
1285836539
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
-764928260
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
1141951532
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
-1208795639
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
859016732
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
880601573
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
-1876752537
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
1813227973

-1840324437
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
-1126051131
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
572499523
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
1328711825
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
-774811202
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
48971006
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
1444831609
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
-488012659
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
983109899
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
-1317382421
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
-247255867
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
-1827124022
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
-1811115177
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
650082880
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
543272946
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
-951660021
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
582295954
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
-1344296936
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
859871261
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
2112004548
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
-662168187
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
181906634
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
-1729333582
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
-1969416213
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
-1272102547
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
659006822
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
258622977
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
30168666
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
432779339
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
1047417787
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
-1162886777
ever to reach the road.
836592188

-1840324437
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
-1539568255
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
-641557736
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
1919855900
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
1933091815
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
2087318817
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
1734118729
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
-1884058571
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
2115894681

-1840324437
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
-1312843338
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
-748313060
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
1048823443
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
-1437901074
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.
1362186230

CHAPTER XXVIII
1577395334

-1840324437

-1840324437
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
1730233563
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
-908877699
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
-706749692
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
-1260827138
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
-1701035601
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
1728949674
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
-1714911126

-1840324437
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
-13239088
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
-1423818394
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
589744732
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
-499549299
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
-388237101
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
-735297414
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
-1157610072
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
-526720053
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
1698926008
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
-1875564739
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
-1865992855
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
432017053
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
-1045811679
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
-243679801
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
85489692
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
-1533430425
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
-1293188168
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
1668709787
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
-2003903925
will seek her breast and ask repose.
999433222

-1840324437
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
1969423130
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
-1076721221
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
-1310063811
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
-1131298603
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
-1063312481

-1840324437
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
1946617803
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
-1662826766
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
-1339321694
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
912712055
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
1695998068
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
-126961260
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
-1105361411
regained the faculty of reflection.
1754929842

-1840324437
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
-1699259687
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
1171203611
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
2060561187
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
-1362150097
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
1111158361
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
1050707633

-1840324437
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
1664032331
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
2065586920
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
1880292881
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
1031283168
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
-1559508047
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
1861080596
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
-125784012
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
1845571049
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
-940398279
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
-376459072
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
-1095461571
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
1052395311
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
-571626561
then chose my couch.
-972401143

-1840324437
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
-620453722

-1840324437
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
850926667
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
1973565855
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
725404905
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
1663418006
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
-1483674777

-1840324437
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
-290731945
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
-1843743688
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
505228096
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
1898621569
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
-351303928
attempts to seek him.
1520177971

-1840324437
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
-1465022569
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
1353791400
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
-1223636592
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
-2050096459
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
-1251465822
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
-1494919237
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
1075101514
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
382693150
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
356047741
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
1598869286
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
-1098892177
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
-1882838587
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
-1070981840
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
-613693230
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
-35567044
sleep forgot sorrow.
-1844519498

-1840324437
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
1977406404
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
-380055180
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
-731718661
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
1508040344
looked round me.
-812768311

-1840324437
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
1676595115
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
-332416645
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
1696707013
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
1814921819
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
2101492119
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
1199940382
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
193689150
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
-214825916
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
1928978350
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
1027044529
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
1363790543
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
728160694
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
1994208937
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
-173909373
out.
1884944723

-1840324437
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
-408433086
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
-1922637659
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
733169268
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
1732900471
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
-762600541
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
-1469471965
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
755138126

-1840324437
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
121551839
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
-2107202795
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
1317293793
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
-233288038
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
476908067
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
-349623851
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
-1278684344
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
728936628
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
81574742
like the rest.
1425252679

-1840324437
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
-1609529947
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
-921430442
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
980806732
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
1919836987
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
-855059059
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
1958608105
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
-1806509778
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
183746941
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
1294375466
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
842076821
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
-623134607
would not; but I must try.
-1334515659

-1840324437
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
-1098531489
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
-2105113967
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
1037785979
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
1758961389
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
920153208
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
1359195800
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
-998435923
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
-1792773866
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
-1331312980
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
2109480494
the village?"
978034710

-1840324437
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
1009609697

-1840324437
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
804020330
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
-1385077736
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
788461259
apply somewhere.  Where?
-1843419448

-1840324437
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
-1641480002
wanted?"
68828194

-1840324437
"Nay; she couldn't say."
-1993115469

-1840324437
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
-302648093
do?"
-1965500748

-1840324437
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
1830545270
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
-129196301

-1840324437
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
-2082794245

-1840324437
"Nay; it was men's work."
863809914

-1840324437
"And what do the women do?"
938709794

-1840324437
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
-1732461948
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
-1030904161

-1840324437
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
-181368786
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
-1515139701
wanted.  I took leave.
-762147383

-1840324437
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
-293456284
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
652250063
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
60190446
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
-1769212967
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
-1675406318
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
24876167
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
-405544166
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
399936449
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
396866469
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
-375998662
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
-413764436
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
-1264231879
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
-1106943964
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
1412427841
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
-138785431
if a servant was wanted here?
525400483

-1840324437
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
794344384

-1840324437
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
-690483921
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
1918147016
no matter what."
-1419155967

-1840324437
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
936012233
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
37011150
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
-1834973244
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
-48444097
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
910843864
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
884680061

-1840324437
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
1657428511
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
-2025465401
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
1052036086
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
-496508462
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
311358417
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
2120733919
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
-887752864

-1840324437
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
-405112007
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
578277367
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
-1596462628
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
-603453833
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
16831431
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
204126526
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
-923491102
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
1830442083
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
571835751
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
1432942513
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
1454673772
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
635800535
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
-1593548904
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
1267299024
this the parsonage?
735799752

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Was the clergyman in?"
-580312925

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Would he be in soon?"
-583710845

-1840324437
"No, he was gone from home."
-43948798

-1840324437
"To a distance?"
-1816739729

-1840324437
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
386636247
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
1529253756
there a fortnight longer."
-324088980

-1840324437
"Was there any lady of the house?"
830176082

-1840324437
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
1284861635
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
-928787919
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
-1995047431

-1840324437
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
-1537500308
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
654609249
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
-1453152615
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
-487408185
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
1885568422
for this handkerchief?"
-1361852145

-1840324437
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
-545809542
that way."
-1345125871

-1840324437
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
1714484517
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
-1479821365

-1840324437
"Would she take my gloves?"
1601246720

-1840324437
"No! what could she do with them?"
496217698

-1840324437
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
1946662492
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
4417712
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
255896304
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
-696107172
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
2015235736
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
652403466
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
-418996996
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
74625983
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
1319102914
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
1389822786
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
-806226090
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
-365893439
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
996660763
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
954335891

-1840324437
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
-180839241
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
-1556995476
said--
2060708905

-1840324437
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
675532086
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
1398556883
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
-685472247
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
-247633717
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
-2139476862

-1840324437
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
-349891042
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
-136581957
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
-2061102738
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
271451983
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
2081812233
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
2031997420
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
743078567
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
-2025774844
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
1339794589
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
-1464775703

-1840324437
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
393140195

-1840324437
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
-188937071
give her these porridge."
1721682067

-1840324437
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
1630384341
pig doesn't want it."
-1335627589

-1840324437
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
-383255387
ravenously.
370263398

-1840324437
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
1395464528
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
702700601

-1840324437
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
1262801527
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
1945760029
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
-474504386
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
565745213
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
946322138
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
-930468716
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
-2099009522
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
-1641677801
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
915450368
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
-81573849
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
-87316229

-1840324437
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
-1581486768
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
1125059239
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
1181652878
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
260037130
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
1138911616
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
183236223

-1840324437
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
-1669320524
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
-1878380108
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
116736125
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
-1073827379
grave."
-1634438084

-1840324437
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
283794730
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
4576805
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
-87494609
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
-1922299174
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
1885216681
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
1601857730
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
1246158465

-1840324437
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
-852488478
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
-1330130318
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
2128245839
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
-1858357225
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
-675186540
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
-220327107
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
1883093038
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
1564696982
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
-1765558498
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
1091240860
it shut in my face."
179095930

-1840324437
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
1382361582
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
-484076648
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
1004717332
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
303595475
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
-672850093
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
-1983610812
long.
377285205

-1840324437
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
-959947368
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
1332467719
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
-764189488
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
-280532666
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
2055180274
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
1215347875

-1840324437
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
1590716685
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
-916665065
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
540325649
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
-1894070353
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
-1261165715
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
238519681
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
322943315
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
-73938470
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
-116975209
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
-1171114669
sable bush-holly or yew.
-1021903426

-1840324437
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
-840109199
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
-740155037
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
-1834300787
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
1298813564
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
1548183008
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
68562238
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
-1661631170
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
927884084
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
-1596512313
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
-1752977901
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
-1644867157
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
-1517759877
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
-1668838820
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
-1779419339
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
-262340227
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
1147419665
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
-220754507

-1840324437
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
-1617683801
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
1971206859
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
596447486
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
-1260899730
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
1903786547
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
-2141990999
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
2116161570
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
-1429380179

-1840324437
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
-1081718666
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
1630761320
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
-894625494
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
-1654400104
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
641982954
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
-247280012
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
81975306
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
-171014071
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
383918369
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
-1056696567
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
382161493
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
-497499634
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
234550602
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
-444658296
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
-216862099
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
-388887523

-1840324437
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
-1799129815
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
-132140857
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
-20847507
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
1940516400
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
1187683777
German I could not tell.
44255706

-1840324437
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
668283627
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
1883006212
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
80492477
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
-1238138093
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
867871120
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
-1147506840

-1840324437
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
-1125075328
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
-118022575
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
-2144290845
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
-697777166
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
729263961

-1840324437
Both were again silent.
-1838533815

-1840324437
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
-889982539
looking up from her knitting.
-273775812

-1840324437
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
-1063548848
other way."
1957970998

-1840324437
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
362619757
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
-581798598

-1840324437
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
278155078
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
-1743687600
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
392275024

-1840324437
"And what good does it do you?"
-402713701

-1840324437
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
-496326341
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
2095466876

-1840324437
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
-611175759

-1840324437
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
1912748199

-1840324437
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
1458880014
master but a lexicon."
218701524

-1840324437
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
325810676
I wonder when St. John will come home."
1701471941

-1840324437
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
-72153996
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
-653137480
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
-920175441

-1840324437
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
-1389050525
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
578068562

-1840324437
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
1237256404
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
655155303

-1840324437
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
1881405448
sad now.
-637651914

-1840324437
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
-1885904554
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
770242126

-1840324437
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
-1310181707

-1840324437
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
-1233229880
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
1028092895
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
-976073302
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
-2096999335
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
1686333385
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
1814999514
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
2002585221
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
-980920625
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
25846998
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
783309758

-1840324437
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
919470625
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
-2007983920
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
-1844548852
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
-213231602
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
-1559819247
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
-1963820769
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
1612394127

-1840324437
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
-2014442997
St. John when he comes in."
-1299860453

-1840324437
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
-1497787568
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
963722446
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
1184295792
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
1632351765
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
-1694665013
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
189048568
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
-1536807034
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
-1554368290
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
71468782
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
2079652332

-1840324437
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
-1311739455
me by the light of the candle she held.
-1832100044

-1840324437
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
-1192851670

-1840324437
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
1282318325
from?"
839394740

-1840324437
"I am a stranger."
1095882454

-1840324437
"What is your business here at this hour?"
1911695466

-1840324437
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
-1627787551
bread to eat."
-1374002656

-1840324437
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
1126480002
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
-1751732723
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
1796959252

-1840324437
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
-303722156

-1840324437
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
1969902041
now; it looks very ill."
742016308

-1840324437
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
1990920590

-1840324437
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
772934183
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
1752629449

-1840324437
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
-73589201
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
-1872706902

-1840324437
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
-1911352404

-1840324437
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
630973859

-1840324437
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
-1769439018
make such a noise.  Move off."
1301477300

-1840324437
"But I must die if I am turned away."
1880122416

-1840324437
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
-1595840662
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
1375911501
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
977261586
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
-1928220461
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
1164523956
bolted it within.
-911146725

-1840324437
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
521395435
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
1296767545
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
-904312181
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
671561400
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
1742784421
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
384481912
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
-1959449326
endeavoured to regain.
138794765

-1840324437
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
706976134
will in silence."
-696909378

-1840324437
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
1389060933
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
-1309899171
and still.
-116133764

-1840324437
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
-1511789303
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
1961163873
if you perished here of want."
1711636398

-1840324437
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
1768482420
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
1512050793
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
-998008277
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
2013279753
to the door.
-695087588

-1840324437
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
1724589206

-1840324437
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
329914849

-1840324437
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
-1273496973
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
-1424607997
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
-11836589
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
1777821328

-1840324437
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
7400691
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
-1718745931
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
-1763446596
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
-530929898
house."
772685190

-1840324437
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
1299844774

-1840324437
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
1434485813
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
1352450977
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
-1543502497
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
1160818237
me.
597905161

-1840324437
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
-857145939

-1840324437
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
1480306764

-1840324437
"She does look white," said Hannah.
1223989162

-1840324437
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
-306264027
sit."
1700943101

-1840324437
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
11936983
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
-303082217

-1840324437
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
-1689124223
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
1803648853

-1840324437
"A mere spectre!"
-1508528691

-1840324437
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
-244198253

-1840324437
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
1557458058
bread."
1809702131

-1840324437
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
1338559895
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
625819756
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
-1921579314
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
536949109
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
-183781621

-1840324437
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
1825348592
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
-164457224
first, eagerly soon.
495683733

-1840324437
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
940233499
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
-668354441

-1840324437
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
1603208014

-1840324437
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
-414282745
name."
10883940

-1840324437
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
1487070320
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
-1506971483

-1840324437
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
-1214345531

-1840324437
I was silent.
-1059611303

-1840324437
"Can we send for any one you know?"
2113915966

-1840324437
I shook my head.
386990587

-1840324437
"What account can you give of yourself?"
544240503

-1840324437
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
758115813
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
-47752208
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
-162300309
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
-374682098
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
-613119354
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
63747284

-1840324437
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
-449748786

-1840324437
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
-939643530

-1840324437
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
492409544
took the word--
-223064880

-1840324437
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
1743303982
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
531626378

-1840324437
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
-84198307
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
733977714
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
-1330522654
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
639777869
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
-1199205798
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
-588029610
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
799457952
silent.
1173863855

-1840324437
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
598064325
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
975433
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
-336010803
matter over."
-1704203778

-1840324437
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
-816644759
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
-1335453763
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
-1075591437
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
-235248445
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
917695618
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
39740817
joy--and slept.
647239339

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXIX
-344743488

-1840324437

-1840324437
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
479429802
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
-887994699
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
1929943809
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
-174522287
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
-2111156939
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
346183338
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
-1148493485
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
-1822216001
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
1762542953
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
1791812808
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
-1820846383
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
1663121574
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
-1214396562
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
2049429644
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
-11432468

-1840324437
"It is very well we took her in."
1988275342

-1840324437
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
231976499
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
112354130

-1840324437
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
-774772019

-1840324437
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
-2039244454
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
-877442414
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
790039489

-1840324437
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
-102396102
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
-709428768
would be agreeable."
1272558245

-1840324437
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
-333609302
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
843961746
myself.  I was comforted.
-1985116827

-1840324437
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
9242727
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
-126066243
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
-1798762989
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
1738062050
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
-1885467162
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
-2144757766
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
-1607702516
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
-1413781147
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
92464289
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
580092814

-1840324437
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
310109587
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
470487455
her permanently."
-875562902

-1840324437
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
1301794810
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
288335256
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
-1023953817
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
-5323524
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
-1661126080
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
606812753

-1840324437
"She is so ill, St. John."
662829563

-1840324437
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
1317515575
are quite wanting in those features."
226431157

-1840324437
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
-522457737
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
281173602
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
27782482
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
550129869
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
-1821432076
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
1236960294
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
2138096577
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
-516204605
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
-352790551

-1840324437
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
-1701564163
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
2005992909
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
-1219737280
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
-1077142978
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
566731195
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
1159631416
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
-2127802050
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
1274229959
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
1268445067
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
-1510977638
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
-133946652
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
-2039733627

-1840324437
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
2064271233
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
-154901221
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
-322682332
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
-342970379
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
1743746667
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
-2142773742
well-dressed, she even smiled.
-865826164

-1840324437
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
-521720636
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
1058338141

-1840324437
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
-2021237135
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
1813393096
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
-924759557

-1840324437
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
-2042501004

-1840324437
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
-1482725001
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
-1929977578
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
452022661

-1840324437
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
-737277015
than yourself or your young ladies."
-286186954

-1840324437
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
-1450096594
nor no brass, I guess?"
-269499152

-1840324437
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
373716677
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
-1162647715

-1840324437
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
1751469618

-1840324437
"Yes, very."
1499658767

-1840324437
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
716665964

-1840324437
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
1384353229

-1840324437
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
679317206

-1840324437
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
1398488890
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
-558273676
basket of the fruit.
-1388359163

-1840324437
"Mak' 'em into pies."
-1580453957

-1840324437
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
-217649107

-1840324437
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
-1820431094

-1840324437
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
616495776

-1840324437
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
688652038
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
-1501089500

-1840324437
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
-1178423558
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
2127913137

-1840324437
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
1953159195
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
1081855070
are."
762559190

-1840324437
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
-1646369585

-1840324437
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
-1201068910

-1840324437
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
1106454466
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
-409354362

-1840324437
"That village a few miles off?
-976163396

-1840324437
"Aye."
-1007402520

-1840324437
"And what is he?"
774954435

-1840324437
"He is a parson."
-1404882590

-1840324437
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
741680361
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
-152651651
residence?"
1619945692

-1840324437
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
-1333054189
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
-1107188051

-1840324437
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
-1866974865

-1840324437
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
1350919873

-1840324437
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
1768370297

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Their father is dead?"
-2073744744

-1840324437
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
-1997128207

-1840324437
"They have no mother?"
1067832034

-1840324437
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
1234933298

-1840324437
"Have you lived with the family long?"
-49348116

-1840324437
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
-95699674

-1840324437
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
-1503593209
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
915238822
beggar."
-399136398

-1840324437
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
-1887281791
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
-1682167888
goes about, you mun forgie me."
-282874121

-1840324437
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
-2113861904
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
1147972666

-1840324437
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
1450203842
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
714478121
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
1975354733

-1840324437
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
110704233

-1840324437
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
1229258526

-1840324437
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
-1250052215
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
-1722542094
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
-1785089592
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
-1996101843
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
-1944691727
to consider poverty a crime."
-234029048

-1840324437
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
1287058862
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
-971568990
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
2075027331

-1840324437
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
1073243953

-1840324437
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
-368686238
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
1893683856

-1840324437
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
-620165960
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
-386577772
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
796388822
the young people.
41782871

-1840324437
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
1730056719
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
613681981
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
181235275
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
-1847074104
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
-72893914
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
-1939421618
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
-1039410196
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
1961356399
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
1849741052
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
913997113
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
-149611436
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
1875319466
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
-307556725
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
-1454123806
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
-346528462
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
-1951504000
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
2143725846
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
-1408750010
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
-1244406936
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
643861418
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
1010687550
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
2026280488
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
918717228
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
-1074699470
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
1381242539
for being united.
1565471061

-1840324437
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
-894811536
ladies and their brother were now.
-1516150306

-1840324437
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
1565245190
to tea."
-143684164

-1840324437
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
-42880595
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
-522447899
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
1086897622
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
-1055982887
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
1566289284

-1840324437
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
-845277495
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
-1131538370

-1840324437
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
-1531278192
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
1031773164
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
-2140465136
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
-225991676
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
-1988616669
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
1594079511
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
1120400289
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
-1750709529
will.
516274069

-1840324437
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
-1347011969
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
312075697
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
-297249727
parlour."
1060571415

-1840324437
"I am very well here."
-2133970307

-1840324437
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
-1707941479

-1840324437
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
1808588487

-1840324437
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
521851565
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
-451675130

-1840324437
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
1046347686
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
-576289542
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
33540154
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
-152562510

-1840324437
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
1664985644
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
-1882406744
parlour, and then its occupant.
-2125698024

-1840324437
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
-1858502286
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
649085244
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
2131385566
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
57332685
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
-1668111688
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
-1370173213
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
1482904533
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
-1910506937
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
-1178923286
and well saved.
143681978

-1840324437
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
-672844690
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
1851272476
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
1421586358
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
1459035478
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
-1721073566
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
1741506990
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
2077021704
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
-1715628838
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
1046382636
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
1133407921
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
-1243310231
fair hair.
1677752885

-1840324437
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
-1783520211
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
496010599
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
-1929878184
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
-882119021
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
820483919
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
1673138996
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
1699217501
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
-1420132715
of the oven.
-1385379235

-1840324437
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
-1242626820
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
-1071368867

-1840324437
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
2099978947
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
1984833087
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
1113440385
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
-630398190
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
-1826712432
from the stranger.
1073448353

-1840324437
"You are very hungry," he said.
-2055796115

-1840324437
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
-1370711360
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
-2103365611

-1840324437
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
1224371372
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
2880125
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
-1078189680
immoderately."
829942547

-1840324437
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
1976923636
contrived, unpolished answer.
-92805481

-1840324437
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
-2042416061
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
1470915553

-1840324437
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
1993124157
absolutely without home and friends."
-1834626452

-1840324437
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
-2080346708
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
-1382633266
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
-1066677979
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
2062150563
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
-534338642
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
171282397
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
786031293
to encourage.
-696253108

-1840324437
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
1437854089
every connection?"
666831010

-1840324437
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
-1926507075
to admittance under any roof in England."
-1526983137

-1840324437
"A most singular position at your age!"
-894309764

-1840324437
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
1118411520
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
388664729
explained the quest.
-334666040

-1840324437
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
1363234146

-1840324437
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
-1587996582
St. John," said she.
-1651446273

-1840324437
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
-471849555

-1840324437
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
998406963
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
1670038729
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
437414059
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
1210998345
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
320250046
out tears as well as colour.
802340749

-1840324437
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
1370991592

-1840324437
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
863357128
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
-1052880787
piercing look.
-1371158094

-1840324437
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
-1199761152
secret," I replied concisely.
282463737

-1840324437
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
1133628492
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
-204665914

-1840324437
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
1189533951
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
66882438

-1840324437
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
209563564
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
-1207752386
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
993061522

-1840324437
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
1873820898
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
-1872326543
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
-939394876

-1840324437
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
-1937642870
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
-1771074472
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
508430634

-1840324437
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
-1763127902
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
-2137699091
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
-1950693802
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
-259407667
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
562683001
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
1842519360
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
1649211893
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
-781722467

-1840324437
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
-606995671
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
969887702
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
1467452472
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
1726785546
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
-259122387
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
1139397110

-1840324437
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
-1364192809

-1840324437
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
528840130
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
370157244
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
-1491829440
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
1030418502
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
-1475907151
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
-1558022398
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
2119665773
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
1500520349
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
-2046120136
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
-1520965049
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
-757751904
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
1907841563
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
587095098
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
-2028337614
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
-416655315
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
1592623246
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
745962388
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
-478441431
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
204239388
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
1507510670

-1840324437
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
-1410214498
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
1047876691
down now, Miss Elliott."
1140847316

-1840324437
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
-848047236
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
1162507689
once.
2094011830

-1840324437
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
600235682

-1840324437
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
568538368
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
-1228373278
sounds strange to me."
-460976903

-1840324437
"Your real name you will not give?"
-1508129466

-1840324437
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
869640194
lead to it, I avoid."
1412289530

-1840324437
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
-142567859
be at peace a while."
-887147945

-1840324437
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
-609242838
and with as much acumen as ever.
-1748806355

-1840324437
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
818204959
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
545450466
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
-1348916385
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
-535786480
us?"
-95484261

-1840324437
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
-1741323478
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
38634440
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
-1938341238
the horrors of homeless destitution."
1220400129

-1840324437
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
-2123054546
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
1119366776
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
653327617

-1840324437
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
383742221
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
-1395566084
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
-125421664
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
-2071668548
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
567311862
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
-96874736
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
-958589534
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
741653884

-1840324437
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
1961441088
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
1308852553
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
-1882325990

-1840324437
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
-367451296
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
-1333651128

-1840324437
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
-1034132464
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
1305362918

-1840324437
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
-316489737
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
1431437834
present strength would permit.
1408224695

CHAPTER XXX
-1619008136

-1840324437

-1840324437
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
-1965218577
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
-1070436798
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
-609337600
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
1273732930
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
-2137932479
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
1457051417
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
-973705893

-1840324437
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
-540003050
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
-1110541325
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
1443440933
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
1175048283
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
822090073
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
-651390325
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
668272196
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
-1319989079
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
-1993589057
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
1343462905
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
413313728
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
1872682877
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
-7088895
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
-2131392801
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
-1952383251
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
759994404
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
1012789271
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
637274684
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
-1220721047
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
822261527
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
1609287061
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
2058356235
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
-972635596
that entranced theirs.
-1071995016

-1840324437
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
693112005
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
-1626459270
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
1449380042
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
1426468946
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
580797247
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
-1347050738

-1840324437
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
-1055742948
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
1049986195
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
931935379
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
1759196244
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
163913955
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
1726275466
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
-1726438614
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
714592651
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
-1334783102
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
-289056342
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
1749657722
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
-892150081
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
2089950180
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
2134812839
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
-1194416470
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
45558571
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
146190488

-1840324437
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
1146189679
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
-503743524
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
-668200410
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
-91848345
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
-1884335605

-1840324437
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
-600624192
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
-1940766134
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
1752431058
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
-1480020034
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
350330316
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
-1780339867
cheerful--
905474773

-1840324437
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
-429167737
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
276793360
propose to myself?"
-1865541367

-1840324437
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
803162541
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
-85019377

-1840324437
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
1299258235
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
1431646464
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
471824560
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
1126381006
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
418010951
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
1056469532
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
1161757341
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
-1592310485
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
1844216877
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
-636659778

-1840324437
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
-420649302
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
-1766851328
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
-780080086
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
-1958588169
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
-1141875636
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
1913296801
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
-350687623
delights they could yield.
-519439447

-1840324437
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
-1001459360
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
1763469537
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
-44076832
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
780462219
produced on me.
-173220728

-1840324437
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
834837630
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
-505679534
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
-2061985592
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
-245993138
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
744410328
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
-1032457176
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
215627994
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
1986868188
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
-97002714
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
641465008
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
-1776930365
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
-292582801
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
-1870577564
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
229068872
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
-142750610
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
-1051404789
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
631603745
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
-248485224
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
-644835955
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
2022170614

-1840324437
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
1502194056
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
-52543952
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
1555245991
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
301621218
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
601514302
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
1459779861
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
722146118
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
-177512645
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
-299685640
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
-1276931673
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
1488163132
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
1833726417
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
600895787
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
-1861539143
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
-239570082
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
-842933456

-1840324437
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
1573231142

-1840324437
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
-1891259624
myself to undertake?"
-397988747

-1840324437
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
2075835785
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
-851326211
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
159029657
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
-1929056042
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
-1752479105

-1840324437
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
414315638

-1840324437
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
650659568
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
2089107222

-1840324437
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
287185852
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
-68364477
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
1962480112
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
-1470667408
interest to me.
1724966516

-1840324437
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
883131916
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
1491722388

-1840324437
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
1456551599
you to accept."
-1132296319

-1840324437
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
1699284163
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
1133451115
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
-1571283870
could have done, and with less trouble.
1306159053

-1840324437
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
-1272043861
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
-1695520223
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
639321457
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
-2137206143
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
2003557791
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
-353806804
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
68093050
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
-289330139
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
-988155423
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
2015430411
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
-1819750882
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
-1297866158
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
1315701029
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
1281581867
'Rise, follow Me!'"
-706438438

-1840324437
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
1457026342
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
-2001089694
glance.  He resumed--
265795194

-1840324437
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
-1843059658
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
1661976527
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
-302289571
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
-1894971219
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
205386373
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
1171656421
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
647163257
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
1710478319
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
1341050029
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
1986424332

-1840324437
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
678493470

-1840324437
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
114072363
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
1776152829
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
-2029239220
succeeding observations.
-825344596

-1840324437
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
293308196
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
-391816686
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
2049760342
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
-1721521269
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
1293669629

-1840324437
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
-1087289833

-1840324437
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
-1504173983
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
1645908316
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
-253322427
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
-52984161
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
-1835123609
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
-625483712
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
-1718233145
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
-400378262
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
-643804351
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
82689640
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
-1082408060
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
941317591
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
-2079039825
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
200059597
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
-267387142
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
424282288
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
1327331218

-1840324437
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
181057088
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
-1941571161
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
1978479584
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
-772389685
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
-1376137292
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
-642312
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
103352965
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
-318654351
decision.
568271745

-1840324437
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
1119536859
heart."
-1822653188

-1840324437
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
-276300197
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
501018435
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
-1011463116
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
957134726
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
-123891988

-1840324437
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
1777602870

-1840324437
"You know what you undertake, then?"
-380830250

-1840324437
"I do."
1339324478

-1840324437
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
-484971899
deeply gratified.
-1529827902

-1840324437
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
-22634211

-1840324437
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
565848268
week."
1254423607

-1840324437
"Very well: so be it."
606997094

-1840324437
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
-197248697
me.  He shook his head.
-1025238412

-1840324437
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
-1113602682

-1840324437
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
-28779969

-1840324437
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
-1598114504

-1840324437
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
89468406
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
1906719609

-1840324437
"I am not ambitious."
-1345944

-1840324437
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
1771090393
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
-1547474307
it out?"
-659892467

-1840324437
"I was speaking of myself."
236295143

-1840324437
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
-259251448

-1840324437
"What?"
-160914463

-1840324437
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
1227068022
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
-221213283
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
-551634668
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
-1931865343
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
-459455295
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
2108374422
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
52718281
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
1665410656
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
-709880067
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
-228881871
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
-820780949
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
-1092341339
some means."
851260466

-1840324437
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
-1339123947
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
1780499160

-1840324437
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
-375415257
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
-1383628910
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
-1391934785
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
2035680849
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
959938522
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
175879370
parting for life.
141147294

-1840324437
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
500848826
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
-1717885595
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
-1336784151
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
950978762
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
-1115857274
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
58685012
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
1417490306
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
756153764

-1840324437
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
-1191974749
she murmured.
-1875851007

-1840324437
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
-181321641
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
1400714420
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
-439147319
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
-1239100105
letter.  He entered.
1829509816

-1840324437
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
-947211557

-1840324437
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
-1698726424
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
1617174694

-1840324437
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
409969747

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
-759911107
demanded, in a low voice.
-1174453467

-1840324437
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
1022264976
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
-232846757

-1840324437
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
94647260
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
-1080795132
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
1425671903
enough.
1429883754

-1840324437
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
378749267

-1840324437
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
560354143
Mary.
1462275223

-1840324437
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
1187139269
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
597134732
what _is_."
768914007

-1840324437
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
793524963

-1840324437
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
1873771

-1840324437
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
-1477584503
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
-2145986267
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
2100283353
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
824226405
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
-988585748
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
-1535161880
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
-229933314
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
606422664
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
-494518962
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
1550465873
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
938674619
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
578907007
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
1523082573
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
-147111806
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
1502957134
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
-283728533
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
551829704
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
-1741062686
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
1972840374

-1840324437
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
-183685812
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
2034898079
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
-1601444569
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
1145848936
and so the old grange was abandoned.
-938716174

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXI
-1328103377

-1840324437

-1840324437
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
738819128
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
-380020870
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
-330899140
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
-937147252
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
-1829289507
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
1324238084
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
-752749989
things as are necessary.
261057852

-1840324437
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
1524270424
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
-159481459
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
1322070436
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
-1237500050
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
956428552
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
1769148398
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
-1524490892
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
2491815
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
-99387279
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
-2108722760
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
-456463721
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
752016995
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
-386926278
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
-931767033
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
-1491284425
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
-1484010211
on from day to day.
1359495475

-1840324437
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
1471616883
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
-2066888851
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
139766680
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
1505592896
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
1674229050
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
-185633579
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
167381749
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
568835564
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
-116421230
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
807169380
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
-1443676282
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
9210595
gratification for disgust.
1250052567

-1840324437
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
-758738444
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
-250498221
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
-1234553075
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
-1100387047
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
-1058495840
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
275413225
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
-1903019818
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
122218129
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
1299646886
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
-225562524
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
-144385453
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
-589251146
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
-21335117
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
-680293082
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
-1924960599
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
200104059

-1840324437
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
-191526686
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
-146110441
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
1931784261

-1840324437
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
194674162
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
-294754728
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
-2075423372
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
908840290

-1840324437
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
1442624505

-1840324437
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
-1360941003
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
1642235854
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
2041950353
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
1716479951
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
-614457738
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
-1549519225
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
-1315445610
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
2131612648
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
481367042
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
-1741335114
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
-312975407
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
-352163866
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
233353004
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
-759188495
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
736594141
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
-1020087398

-1840324437
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
2117179528
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
1912888608

-1840324437
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
212974562
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
-159688384
doubtless very visible upon it.
1912672719

-1840324437
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
1727622180
asked.
581336668

-1840324437
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
-1944484853
scholars very well."
505177091

-1840324437
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
-215664665
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
-1342926536
I interrupted--
1645847559

-1840324437
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
1034395966
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
1551291435
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
689502750
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
-62958268
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
-944561692
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
-1508443733
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
444868264

-1840324437
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
655027631
is dark and empty."
4401931

-1840324437
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
1402971772
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
-1010120924

-1840324437
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
-1391314255
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
135887009
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
-958519877
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
-1663931023
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
81015476
steadily, for some months at least."
271131542

-1840324437
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
774681852

-1840324437
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
328639286
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
-77622644
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
108341686
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
1530975092
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
2098870571
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
-123875588
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
752702001
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
622394106
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
1895317057
rougher than it.
-510851301

-1840324437
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
1652082595
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
1613512900
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
526626351
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
1176469625
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
-1513165535
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
-477816949
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
1162865054
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
1379621209
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
1425954090
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
851198531
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
-508490119
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
-1043728511
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
1991356598
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
-1555875697
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
-207340230

-1840324437
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
-1153509324
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
1799620317
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
1330840634
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
-1711131884
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
1327176219
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
185982063
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
-1208799162
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
-25301439
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
-1775801778

-1840324437
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
-59737690
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
290358901
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
-185104815
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
1914534567
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
-444767389
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
1742286732
exclaimed--
-417289020

-1840324437
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
291761994
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
-1851373646
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
538028196
your back towards me now."
-1452601940

-1840324437
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
361913746
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
-1375521446
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
-45250472
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
-1346866926
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
-450324794
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
-191475484
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
1285031784
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
-1703819829
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
905076460
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
1825372687
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
-30743153
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
-1580454232
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
1708279757
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
-244520602
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
-795248440
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
513124577
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
1621862121
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
632509180
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
618786328
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
2111907623
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
1425107044
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
51189125
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
-1755403640
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
-1716458946
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
-1521847451
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
-1236270331
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
-2040021192

-1840324437
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
1651796540
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
-1328101251
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
-564807636
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
1453393049
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
184038406

-1840324437
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
-631028340
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
636838134

-1840324437
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
1748785838
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
-1053370311
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
1165728254
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
-932948328
pointing to me.
-472945809

-1840324437
"It is," said St. John.
-538888595

-1840324437
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
681599764
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
-2091743892

-1840324437
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
-978397914

-1840324437
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
-286428499

-1840324437
"Quite."
-880544951

-1840324437
"Do you like your house?"
863328257

-1840324437
"Very much."
-1149919215

-1840324437
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
-362779532

-1840324437
"Very nicely, indeed."
-2112662835

-1840324437
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
-1174667880

-1840324437
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
2083578280
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
677446733
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
240444
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
1725091185

-1840324437
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
-125909907
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
360338889
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
-1845195708
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
805792089
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
-1460602082
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
1262268997
merchants to shame."
-235361931

-1840324437
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
-746015304
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
-897181960
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
63468162
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
1923976293
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
-1949909126
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
1416144480
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
993721246

-1840324437
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
-2018291416
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
1765732988
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
-341374298

-1840324437
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
-1609776746
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
2144317526
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
-980253569
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
-1928404826
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
-2032952877
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
-813460726
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
-1774201318
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
1640497523
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
-800887201

-1840324437
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
294554722
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
-280190928
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
1684104173

-1840324437
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
-1149108282
John.
-787105992

-1840324437
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
252632283
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
1028976298
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
1633397774
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
-453264556
her own.
2048251084

-1840324437
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
-1326288025
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
1789877104
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
630191105
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
1490116052
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
2116635008
papa."
-555871217

-1840324437
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
1000759225

-1840324437
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
967831070
it cost him thus to refuse.
1617681903

-1840324437
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
-763606171
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
-1400007230

-1840324437
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
-1444348577
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
295405444
returned.
-2082948941

-1840324437
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
-1812266724
blanched as her gown.
1423860860

-1840324437
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
1425885166
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
-824109125
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
717676026
at all.
1139582880

-1840324437
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
-1769935991
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
-1500744121
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.
-171405863

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXII
-776821996

-1840324437

-1840324437
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
133778541
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
-573106711
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
-1632508658
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
-1193062699
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
-877606602
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
1966655985
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
139410569
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
2130656613
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
920954555
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
1186084826
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
-794167159
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
810093092
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
1810589442
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
1762627071
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
-1013985067
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
996106494
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
-361200434
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
78659832
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
935960043
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
1927245079
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
989226877
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
-440785353
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
162125589
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
1317298588
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
-1142791185
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
-552024096
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
1039826280
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
-160526917
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
-295020765
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
2064981441

-1840324437
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
1291401920
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
1525485287
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
-644238985
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
795802521
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
1490088488
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
1202350528
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
-1613232497
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
-1324064554
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
1993861458
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
631884084
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
-418154925
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
2050540178
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
-1441225577
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
-2025465915
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
1945886014
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
662183356
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
2003657107
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
-92016651
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
2063724691
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
-347672010
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
615557787
duties of the day.
-1459775058

-1840324437
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
-1304804394
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
-1977141181
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
-1851418135
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
119883664
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
-2086232172
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
-1195259961
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
-477944596
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
1881797371
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
-10935381
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
-860804681
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
130103511
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
1192693752
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
-1329291461
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
1133258908
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
2026619172
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
549286245

-1840324437
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
-594809993
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
-1669824389
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
-1944216704
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
261060753
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
-1749171796
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
-58872228
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
-516166274
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
-518938449
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
-1265856521

-1840324437
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
-1406459052
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
-18340772
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
216765956
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
-644473175
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
195456502
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
-518158272
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
-758932358
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
1050509901
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
-1287952151
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
282332301
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
1317125507
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
-1298391196

-1840324437
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
-1925115745
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
-562498459
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
-714973983
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
-1503301275
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
1515895228
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
1530773430
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
1534619235
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
1121643282
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
1795721263
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
408890637
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
-1460370611
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
-1180411140
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
-1208391358
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
343238587
acquaintance.
-1429159317

-1840324437
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
-1565100275
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
-1649731688
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
714028524
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
2066674121
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
1636110780
if known, would make a delightful romance.
-29006186

-1840324437
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
1762908360
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
35798925
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
1799721110
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
-415467590
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
-357357209
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
-890901514
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
-189188386
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
-1465089752

-1840324437
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
-1329201418
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
-95519472
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
246386254

-1840324437
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
-1683076785
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
1668760831
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
1880213562
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
-1874885794
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
1816465868
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
1786969642
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
-2140741385
day.
-1415695375

-1840324437
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
248771027
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
-115089500
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
-14886803
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
-1848743551
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
1599994688
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
487903123
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
1126262408
Hall.
-312183736

-1840324437
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
-352408911
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
1086268739
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
380164859
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
1468217299
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
1508768998
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
-1533812313
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
-415585029

-1840324437
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
-89177736
high family, papa."
1853782980

-1840324437
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
80438992
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
-694147263
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
789713639
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
-204476365
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
-298738511
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
-761267780
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
277645983
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
-627819835
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
1764520363
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
2077663781
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
439290240
compensation for the want of fortune.
-515878527

-1840324437
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
-1949261143
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
903193740
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
2087277895
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
574310882
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
-1315783916

-1840324437
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
12027624
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
70255805
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
-1019606994
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
281978109
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
-666423821
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
-1628739650
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
-680982707
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
743987224
Rivers.
-1760573874

-1840324437
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
-726376785
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
769445460
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
-2045787810
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
-910348902
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
1759695586
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
821801265
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
1265801107
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
-1424081251
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
-1038895855
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
1856227796
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
-322052826
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
-1675610464
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
-1037462113
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
-1280412538
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
1378910222
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
-699832799

-1840324437
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
-545346985
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
-1725558019
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
-1585927654
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
-735961869
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
104858739
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
1599518605
him some good, if I could.
-287457794

-1840324437
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
-1972828083
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
396487845
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
-685065094
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
1683561731
him talk."
763072394

-1840324437
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
1439212231
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
508550034
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
173340267
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
1974319819
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
1779857313
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
1830587894

-1840324437
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
2053277761

-1840324437
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
-1842522128

-1840324437
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
-1645136102

-1840324437
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
-395585211
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
-592234038
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
-316234137
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
1794437307
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
-133903559
rose and placed it in his hand.
-552656355

-1840324437
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
-1819299502
graceful and correct drawing."
990520100

-1840324437
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
2049960002
like?"
-1908860357

-1840324437
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
-1229531491

-1840324437
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
471111736
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
-1828904691
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
-1674153713
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
1845092468
deem worthless."
-1056627200

-1840324437
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
-1615607089
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
-988561497
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
220672891
smiles!"
-1248499461

-1840324437
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
1649328129
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
-432416182
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
-1773471823
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
1460065575

-1840324437
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
1867436278
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
-1579115710

-1840324437
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
-1264300670
or wise is another question."
886809923

-1840324437
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
19268861
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
785822459
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
-283254594
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
1149823581
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
-526032814
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
874303660
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
251764890

-1840324437
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
-673735129
take to yourself the original at once."
-88898203

-1840324437
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
-688685562
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
304513070
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
-1377198617
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
-1953639960
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
125507681
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
-1777890898
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
105550363
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
941353514
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
-1611355723
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
1372030542

-1840324437
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
2050659411
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
-85103750
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
-159789980
ought to marry her."
-2060275166

-1840324437
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
-1087685474

-1840324437
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
1200100551
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
1856011657
often."
-1615748393

-1840324437
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
-54910226
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
-2011946341
the table to measure the time.
-69144988

-1840324437
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
1780434745
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
567420634
fetter your heart?"
-808218980

-1840324437
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
659699843
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
706612955
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
-113918717
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
-565389170
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
861214913
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
-835174056
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
757142191
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
327476026
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
1376739866
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
284736917
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
374631594
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
719664570
time I marked pass in peace."
683463357

-1840324437
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
1765569225
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
-10887106
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
1991599841

-1840324437
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
1285596980
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
1566950828
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
1895819297
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
138432634
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
-457057315

-1840324437
I gazed at him in wonder.
-651242511

-1840324437
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
-638404470
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
353586602
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
-1754800714
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
-273105385
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
362974358
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
-1240617863
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
-2117327544

-1840324437
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
-1042501574

-1840324437
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
410149828
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
152474565
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
-1145069102
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
1869396794
a missionary's wife?  No!"
-1726662816

-1840324437
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
-1676584653

-1840324437
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
1925797936
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
1226449088
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
-1336814468
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
-1980950559
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
-1455524827
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
993672547
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
539726039
live for."
-1033979527

-1840324437
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
1008371771
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
1529656558

-1840324437
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
428802425
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
-1505789617
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
-2001016162
should do."
-2044494143

-1840324437
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
-501840074
wasting away."
1668457805

-1840324437
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
239856989
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
797576591
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
1792735409
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
-1497190853
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
327304191

-1840324437
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
11113102
schoolroom."
-103035317

-1840324437
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
-1825521331
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
-352152258
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
514658768
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
694458364
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
2084534909
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
1761854383

-1840324437
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
1828910840
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
-358575532
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
-64478411
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
-1802420142
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
1818783020
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
-1868539771
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
1133845850
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
198225252
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
-1293745988

-1840324437
I smiled incredulously.
-1069042959

-1840324437
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
-1040508199
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
-563646077
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
1624672379
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
372396656
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
12326338
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
-391638765
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
1678829706
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
305906693
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
1229162327
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
-76753625
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
108867745
still suffer."
928657968

-1840324437
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
1116630580

-1840324437
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
-647606849
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
176333231
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
-271620987
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
-844753924
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
1696371856
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
1797460908
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
629711300
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
1292660056
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
280505700
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
536297933
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
826953225
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
104590337
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
-1531279505
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
2121298343

-1840324437
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
-479762000
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
711595062

-1840324437
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
1926557715
World, indeed!"
-1184736339

-1840324437
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
-1965510246

-1840324437
"_Cui bono_?  No."
1093556840

-1840324437
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
-357061319
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
-431765359
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
-2064674557
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
1600279315
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
-298906536
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
1589840854
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
-1876239202
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
-1255689570
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
-1748467417

-1840324437
"What is the matter?" I asked.
-271065729

-1840324437
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
-1359640598
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
736111194
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
716376525

-1840324437
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
-1251700327
globe, however!"
-618559294

-1840324437
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
1760551116
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
1709672159
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
-642891425
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
2087356421
forgot it.
2033527515

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXIII
2140824346

-1840324437

-1840324437
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
1827238796
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
153533838
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
-181466150
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
-838428116
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
476081793
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
-983854638
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
2070782508

-1840324437
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
1764495850
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
-2114535105
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
232025544
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
-640418209
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
768723350
      In yellow lustre shone"--
1720219137

-1840324437
I soon forgot storm in music.
527427861

-1840324437
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
1265958024
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
-176138494
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
1385557828
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
1097280004
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
-624790537
vale that night.
2082787531

-1840324437
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
-730010111

-1840324437
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
-1333938263
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
-547754605
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
1708632006
boots.
1252807119

-1840324437
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
969503099
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
-822620058
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
-1373856953
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
-937663617

-1840324437
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
1505343759

-1840324437
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
-217086235
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
1072142622
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
470528698
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
1188656605
impatient to hear the sequel."
966152274

-1840324437
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
-682720234
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
-410439839
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
-1035379225
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
-2094894753
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
275266754
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
-538597456
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
1079381090
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
-490677884
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
1397070435
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
-595529171
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
-120137831

-1840324437
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
1269875810
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
-32073092
health."
1974155121

-1840324437
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
71161812
What do you see amiss in me?"
2118127611

-1840324437
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
2018075901
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
135741044
silenced.
1624024919

-1840324437
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
809926049
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
-154677384
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
701432449
was behind him.
-839463771

-1840324437
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
-125464024

-1840324437
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
-266366536
alone now, and return to my book."
1729710409

-1840324437
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
-1993319201
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
-1011641816
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
1628119273
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
-550551910
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
522553523
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
-827321581
I would.
-1713454707

-1840324437
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
514911912

-1840324437
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
990459965

-1840324437
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
1475028723
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
-152472872

-1840324437
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
1556498749
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
-84719783
and my scholars.
-1535836558

-1840324437
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
-76306158
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
-966256929
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
-437120125

-1840324437
"Indeed!"
-160556933

-1840324437
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
1929445919

-1840324437
"Does he?"
1840684293

-1840324437
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
-1753385672

-1840324437
"I know."
73278426

-1840324437
"Was it your suggestion?"
1350263831

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Whose, then?"
1971255152

-1840324437
"His daughter's, I think."
-2089156444

-1840324437
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
-94184397

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
-1801422925
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
-786993416

-1840324437
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
-701647705

-1840324437
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
-77062974

-1840324437
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
1077082402
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
-1723079519
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
-1464973147
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
866064280
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
-1087604354
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
-850388446
trite or novel, it is short.
1110350217

-1840324437
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
1977446596
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
-745954134
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
504492735
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
-944694325
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
106808741
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
252707723
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
1912845985
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
-128158481
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
-281543004
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
-1428878071
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
-2110025314
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
-377154365
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
-511022447
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
-1758153089
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
118413962
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
-2011350609
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
1628238758
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
635815587
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
2123369077
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
1424908634
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
-1843943459
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
961522560
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
1173301232
Rochester."
990286424

-1840324437
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
1012849852

-1840324437
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
1355897583
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
-1510575229
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
-323660630
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
-408498927
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
978728113
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
1385591772
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
-1324085575
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
-1333671095
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
-1291123280
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
1652974509
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
-1949804525
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
970580353
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
-7148447
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
-5098485
odd tale?"
674786018

-1840324437
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
-291317947
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
-138173345
doing?  Is he well?"
-424872561

-1840324437
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
1433191065
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
1943253203
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
-1511668434
which requires her appearance."
-1453195626

-1840324437
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
-152703534

-1840324437
"I suppose not."
-1220992408

-1840324437
"But they wrote to him?"
647488615

-1840324437
"Of course."
-1370055360

-1840324437
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
163804310

-1840324437
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
595209193
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
66016194

-1840324437
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
218359280
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
831369647
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
29114188
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
403287621
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
-499190727
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
-1386273286

-1840324437
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
81114635

-1840324437
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
658831672
warmth.
-34746317

-1840324437
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
-523046789
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
-601691741
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
1259562186
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
827011574
down, fairly committed to black and white."
-883056485

-1840324437
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
281847142
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
102771458
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
104232850
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
-259806658
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
336198310
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
-1764519157
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
-644561024

-1840324437
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
1494319233
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
-723763
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
489736787
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
263705832

-1840324437
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
-1901611168
Rochester than you do."
-1766793061

-1840324437
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
-1526772199
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
-414078712
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
125867001
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
1523357156

-1840324437
"Well, what did he want?"
1274036681

-1840324437
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
1896785575
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
2075422659
that--nothing more."
-1955930090

-1840324437
"I!--rich?"
-1720387774

-1840324437
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
561526347

-1840324437
Silence succeeded.
1972665766

-1840324437
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
1865222318
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
-188678117
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
-1992076556
will and the necessary documents."
599065857

-1840324437
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
260015928
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
-1296658606
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
1137692771
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
-1673031274
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
-1461816862
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
580630285
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
1010161243
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
1074988694
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
1200076860
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
-1994147866

-1840324437
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
1374761122
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
144743181
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
-374860758
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
1700721243
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
-1663206733
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
-961000500
that--that thought swelled my heart.
1985741048

-1840324437
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
521407782
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
2094232610
will ask how much you are worth?"
-1630784829

-1840324437
"How much am I worth?"
-308293241

-1840324437
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
1274300829
think they say--but what is that?"
-52955629

-1840324437
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
-778179826

-1840324437
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
1353153807
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
-355931039
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
1582175786

-1840324437
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
-403570
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
678241104

-1840324437
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
-978547888

-1840324437
"No mistake at all."
-1442516387

-1840324437
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
1336848110

-1840324437
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
1493355732

-1840324437
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
-578070856
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
-1271465573
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
1993769718

-1840324437
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
-1222358645
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
-1032984144
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
-262863580
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
-1117132757
Good-night."
1931934718

-1840324437
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
1145316595
minute!" I cried.
394237265

-1840324437
"Well?"
-1332934482

-1840324437
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
1736923330
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
1574120456
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
1075285445

-1840324437
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
-34877359
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
-603212421

-1840324437
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
-460509479
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
1641380806
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
-430056303

-1840324437
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
2082377692
about it."
1134250914

-1840324437
"Another time."
-105505277

-1840324437
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
908017341
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
-644368579

-1840324437
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
-235060561

-1840324437
"I would rather not just now."
-1518366785

-1840324437
"You shall!--you must!"
-157975698

-1840324437
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
1302604468

-1840324437
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
-1933351703
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
-317243944

-1840324437
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
-2031735989
persuade."
-940090246

-1840324437
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
1218611316

-1840324437
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
1328473742

-1840324437
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
1014409120

-1840324437
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
-1142292022
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
1368485439
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
-141494215
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
-560242199
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
-191807088

-1840324437
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
-625779122
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
641205029
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
-492868575

-1840324437
"Of course: that was all settled before."
-1018724363

-1840324437
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
370199826
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
624945379

-1840324437
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
1949327712
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
1345057097
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
276239047

-1840324437
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
1588682127
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
-558664627
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
790651152
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
2141543262
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
1523558844
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
-618861985
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
1259196514
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
-2077808009
explanation.
-328865355

-1840324437
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
-1527672239
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
21527935
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
-1883139233
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
-442246967
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
1492697028
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
-1867026745
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
-1902380793
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
-993402714
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
-1761672621
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
2001051442
against the door.
1535195331

-1840324437
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
-155376069
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
1432798222
enough.  I resumed--
-997577835

-1840324437
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
702502186

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"My aunt, consequently?"
-211627318

-1840324437
He bowed.
1341602218

-1840324437
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
512637718
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
1053510816

-1840324437
"Undeniably."
-864712136

-1840324437
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
603550809
the same source?"
407366097

-1840324437
"We are cousins; yes."
1454122779

-1840324437
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
-422215421
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
-2022720057
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
1167414768
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
-307662131
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
561245875
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
-1937249477
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
8726063
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
-823078728
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
1616269516
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
-542034298
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
588881328
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
-1842744501
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
-987891836

-1840324437
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
-677254636

-1840324437
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
-1918073320
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
1953657231
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
-1662021900

-1840324437
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
10945147
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
1042507501
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
1269420018
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
-1948046437

-1840324437
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
2092281496
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
-1458896765
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
2109616613
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
1360063586
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
1771454096
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
-344089792
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
743548435
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
-771508695
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
-1034039962
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
114736692
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
-348640021
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
793614479
enjoyment.
951281273

-1840324437
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
-2020578819
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
344629882
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
802033997
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
-1642219384
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
819489350

-1840324437
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
-1578296586
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
-1065148770
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
-703867387

-1840324437
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
455689278
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
759895304

-1840324437
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
147318467
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
-1913846149
like an ordinary mortal?"
1427911528

-1840324437
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
1792581289
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
1867607503

-1840324437
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
-396424996
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
1017219328

-1840324437
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
1312336160
comprehend better."
1231541513

-1840324437
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
-1911627814
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
-726923702
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
-1267051481
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
-1548201975
fortune that has accrued to them."
-240207451

-1840324437
"To you, you mean."
-631939108

-1840324437
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
-1121773947
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
78000863
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
-682570540
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
-1169281423
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
627761414
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
248012785
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
-407806548
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
367363278
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
-535874389
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
-1444250163

-1840324437
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
1048022462
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
-1677462593

-1840324437
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
2063686815
the case?"
-1245109759

-1840324437
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
560663582
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
-110469902
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
-289594147
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
-1799983240
consider it absolutely your own."
-374346348

-1840324437
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
-1370112867
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
-552533010
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
-645004961
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
277117651
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
1624244938
myself lifelong friends."
-761025610

-1840324437
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
-442865074
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
209866451
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
-1314695890
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
121220201
you: you cannot--"
-197222160

-1840324437
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
1741614347
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
2042899294
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
661934993
and own me, are you?"
1340701397

-1840324437
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
807392130
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
1784434212

-1840324437
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
-269157734
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
234230843
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
-970127710
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
-1842213891

-1840324437
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
-1793622447
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
909461405

-1840324437
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
-1656634484

-1840324437
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
-262335254
excitement under which you labour."
-1868180604

-1840324437
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
30513183
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
592013302
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
20995833
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
227778092
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
-720720299
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
429083394
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
-935345087

-1840324437
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
867562048
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
690230807
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
-1595395708
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
-1952508294
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
-412560523
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
1902522105
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
1332069042

-1840324437
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
-1473655611
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
-2122477133
scruple."
-1064042696

-1840324437
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
1596037330

-1840324437
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
1853905041

-1840324437
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
-1224775896

-1840324437
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
1971820037
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
111961379
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
434886025
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
-1941402298
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
1382882315
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
1564315278
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
349178440
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
-432300226
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
1875708017
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
1131828093
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
1643882565

-1840324437

-1840324437
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
-1659989595
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
-312558000
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
-1482101768
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
-1781999955
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
-833586869
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
449315056
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
1963278444
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
-53092969
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
564744364
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
889784557
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
-1338086998

-1840324437
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
-1422372446
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
2142061688
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
-922811755
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
1808799587
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
-945456956
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
1884699638
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
-2007413717
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
-536856795
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
4605581
girls.
-1354880252

-1840324437
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
213474373
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
64319868
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
1597325049

-1840324437
"Doubtless."
-1763917229

-1840324437
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
-1675295693
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
-1498055202

-1840324437
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
-517198157
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
1618996882
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
917439281
it and disposed for full holiday."
-1418260923

-1840324437
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
-118848719
What are you going to do?"
-2141437623

-1840324437
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
1998270542
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
1730876901

-1840324437
"Do you want her?"
1415931495

-1840324437
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
-2077747582
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
87312087

-1840324437
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
-1990346503
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
1768579181

-1840324437
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
931036092
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
460395594

-1840324437
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
2078053456
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
1841223255
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
-334491029
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
-1636281723
now?"
2039600412

-1840324437
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
2041432411
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
1138863676
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
-2054157579
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
420625880
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
1397892698
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
1866945643
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
1835558918
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
-2041627152
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
-32004597
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
-1014191569
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
1800126847
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
1315490884
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
1367051558
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
-1420640865

-1840324437
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
796213896

-1840324437
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
526952658
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
-817791230
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
1765643513

-1840324437
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
-1720351573

-1840324437
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
-1589557850
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
1155638161

-1840324437
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
-1826901188

-1840324437
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
-421821170
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
-380267032
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
1378272335
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
1928936994
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
-80085960
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
741621684

-1840324437
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
-1864769795
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
1224521743
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
-304150124

-1840324437
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
881034848
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
-643415227
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
-835375097
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
2126727485
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
1851028751
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
-687346451
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
-1836546644
hear, Jane?"
346484009

-1840324437
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
1890202381
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
1295746510

-1840324437
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
1289759981
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
1541293364
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
-2119345525
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
-2112090514
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
2084071973
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
-2110939649
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
-1770801862
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
-446330955
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
1480163733
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
1456283857
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
-1431658505
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
-275201086
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
21302263
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
-1214426155
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
-263110837
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
1307861943
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
1486163742
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
-482780062
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
-654077359
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
-475552197
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
1715599132
without.
1783232985

-1840324437
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
-1793192908
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
-327180367
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
402322283

-1840324437
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
-1713711788
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
838029019
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
1817069649
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
1986118846
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
1512455239
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
-375005399
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
-994229202
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
1997331732
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
-2085553403
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
-1495668833
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
-239071904
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
1325599839
improved aspect of his abode.
1595497242

-1840324437
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
-2026945511
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
-379620721
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
1895506334

-1840324437
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
80078439
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
1676408548
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
-1261733235
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
-2079038234
could I tell him where such a book was?"
-1238518177

-1840324437
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
1943344748
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
-1988009

-1840324437
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
1908116797
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
-1126787063
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
-833333727
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
349797943
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
-2014828397
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
1709497408
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
-553742987
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
-230530882
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
-852165340
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
1020356437
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
-835694232
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
-1891187575
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
-1260924162
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
864003502
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
-1122976723
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
-1741139112
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
-1821489928
column, gloomy and out of place.
-2014021388

-1840324437
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
-1869939701
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
-282795311
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
-1959087606
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
-2003206066
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
-349119274
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
-1288029108
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
145709309
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
1015358940
career--I see it now."
-1223162296

-1840324437
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
77099003
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
2023053243
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
1610971879
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
-1898022955
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
2020090711
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
1251351885
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
2043662624
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
-1941083560
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
36464366
into the house.
314882335

-1840324437
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
-1759472006
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
-549149143
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
-955016865
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
-1345642452
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
784699775
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
-1364592059
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
201795290
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
-2113026889

-1840324437
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
110374801
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
1342134746
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
-626638648
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
-1541295002
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
-874184297
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
1070163106
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
-1406159977

-1840324437
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
-865829361
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
-1904661635
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
-2084716855
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
-1687457279
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
2111167381
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
747999036
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
1136106468
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
-170835468
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
1053167800
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
-835765900
mother, who was drawing away."
118398030

-1840324437
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
-1955654778

-1840324437
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
-184725044
the way."
-1869066582

-1840324437
"Tell him I will go."
-1692739890

-1840324437
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
1782921492
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
-429629392
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
1436164171
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
566409271

-1840324437
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
1592052862
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
-940200060
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
1788609015
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
-1793704431
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
83682187
with himself.
1712948499

-1840324437
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
-863974032
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
1356276340
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
-315360107
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
1734382779
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
26736459
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
45372829
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
-365478882
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
-1263016989
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
-549563695
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
-520870428
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
-1310367359

-1840324437
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
1386785419
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
-1778895783

-1840324437
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
-366818959
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
394202636
ensuing year.
571543069

-1840324437
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
-1708778244
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
1641816132
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
1532941648
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
-1857757373

-1840324437
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
973125766
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
-1538358994
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
212380431
yesterday."
955825769

-1840324437
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
2087101884
he was serene as glass.
-918082460

-1840324437
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
1660887982
known each other long."
-754344977

-1840324437
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
-327156129
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
-1784427747
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
502963044
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
-862832207
can he refitted for their reception."
496113648

-1840324437
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
1460449941
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
100118248
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
-1035876376
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
713867153
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
1716365484
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
-1181001113
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
-1341972633
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
-402363688
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
-1391400108
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
1554128298
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
1707244155
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
602701058
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
734079064
frigidity.
599688665

-1840324437
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
-1844626914
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
-814494040

-1840324437
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
578492865

-1840324437
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
2130340166
moment's hesitation I answered--
-787314253

-1840324437
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
-1828090013
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
130414404

-1840324437
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
540261131
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
-1109055345
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
550279677
returned to his papers and his silence.
1851818634

-1840324437
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
-482467831
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
-716077881
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
1460067690
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
389419552
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
-998877233
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
1407511116
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
1041288046
plans.
-1553020389

-1840324437
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
-309691944
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
-6251011
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
-2012437022
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
278613028
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
181435197
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
-1145988291
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
1705664199
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
1540287038
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
-2123918405
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
1141327937
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
1051758777
the task without regard to the elements.
-1677257933

-1840324437
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
-857989935
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
892489598
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
1392322118
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
1840186638

-1840324437
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
1617194432
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
1234386722
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
852116660
was a special annoyance.
1669221633

-1840324437
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
-1105139319
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
1064236078
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
113569950
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
-1727111246
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
120812218
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
-1212791156
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
-430242827
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
1032474359

-1840324437
"Jane, what are you doing?"
1778229447

-1840324437
"Learning German."
-162375903

-1840324437
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
1868649493

-1840324437
"You are not in earnest?"
1563049522

-1840324437
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
-1446298401

-1840324437
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
1436069669
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
-1848262335
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
1932923061
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
1049183420
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
825153576
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
1162296077
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
-1095707442
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
237158036
barely three months to his departure.
1717171958

-1840324437
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
12887711
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
975428967
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
-980650973
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
906157514
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
1292011883
such a step.  He answered quietly--
-1403138778

-1840324437
"I know it."
1679266933

-1840324437
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
379885638
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
78367287
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
1044502992
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
-1622699923
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
-197962190
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
-1311476220
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
-3022650
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
-1343240928
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
751001973
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
-715171307
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
905623031
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
-1802442654

-1840324437
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
-1364282195
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
1605443491
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
-1507624044
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
24001162
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
352574215

-1840324437
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
-935458652
her as such: you should kiss her too."
-1362981468

-1840324437
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
1056029012
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
1253890423
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
-1735658901
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
-1688237796
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
1043318319
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
1339457255
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
-859446445
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
-1880086272
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
-1748836547
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
-1652174066
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
453787517
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
-1650597811

-1840324437
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
-1963122624
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
804400562
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
1616168954
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
524636344
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
1257396101
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
1269849902
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
-2058684218
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
-96820958
own.
-2120023423

-1840324437
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
-334997735
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
155365550
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
1088077143

-1840324437
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
1810432809
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
-170167738
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
1822989152
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
1221694858
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
1836233347
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
841294112
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
-1510156018
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
-164506012

-1840324437
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
1323668661
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
1760717558
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
780090873
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
1703921327
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
-1681398381
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
-1957458121
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
-1722197701
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
549854665
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
1660685139

-1840324437
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
520545415
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
-715517965
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
-470878987
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
1607388417
then I felt dark indeed.
-1359881174

-1840324437
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
-1232070952
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
829869765
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
-1481491272
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
-2117080156
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
-1151328058
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
-154635400
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
1056572255
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
-645988943

-1840324437
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
1766617210
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
-1891216206
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
-724528625
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
-1059875875
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
1247574024
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
545885054
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
-553422623
eyes filled again.
-390230987

-1840324437
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
1242456303
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
2051087277
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
-364426331
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
812838358
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
-1419677426
as to its cause; he only said--
1436467431

-1840324437
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
1849382221
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
14844697
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
990167837
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
1641994567
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
-885991266
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
2105686651
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
2145092039
said--
2060708905

-1840324437
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
-319446858

-1840324437
"I will call Diana and Mary."
-1718097082

-1840324437
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
1395546470
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
1898223040
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
-332812875

-1840324437
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
-1865511227
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
-939326666
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
-464152195
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
-1133859938
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
-1175508877
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
128843293
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
1022841063
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
1314130470

-1840324437
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
174851223
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
488811018
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
-824907477
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
-2134889830
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
-1437861431
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
1511710096
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
1628096042
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
-978752816

-1840324437
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
1445815546
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
428568708
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
625523541
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
-128535412
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
1485699206
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
577773273
last refuge for silence.
1832543156

-1840324437
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
1112343869
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
-454855944
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
526627539
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
1390818168
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
-1187848635

-1840324437
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
1506794578
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
1173620395
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
-795225780

-1840324437
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
-2032500702
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
1219110121
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
648590136

-1840324437
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
1518270659
sails on the 20th of June."
-2117132168

-1840324437
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
561256364

-1840324437
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
-754150727
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
-5717948
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
-718989410
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
2056587908
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
1438228707
same enterprise."
-566739657

-1840324437
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
519154603
to march with the strong."
-1645391533

-1840324437
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
241844971
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
842815716

-1840324437
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
-1052305269

-1840324437
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
-160861200
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
-281733056
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
2026114331
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
-1774643820

-1840324437
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
-1710096605
the first to inform them of it?"
1074472452

-1840324437
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
-532677025
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
482944438
rivet the spell.
-878427132

-1840324437
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
1424716354

-1840324437
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
-1725142416

-1840324437
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
1471245299
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
-44899084

-1840324437
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
1106970792
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
454655401
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
-1280996356
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
1629661123

-1840324437
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
-381834198

-1840324437
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
2096411651
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
-519698803

-1840324437
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
1522989692
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
715713617
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
-1867063430
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
1833850006
service."
797045418

-1840324437
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
-638646453

-1840324437
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
1584513360
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
1239754457
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
2027201082
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
292725205
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
427435223
for him.
892767420

-1840324437
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
1312997430
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
837091763
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
493000952
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
-220887727
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
1397815586
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
1125843823
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
1680039283
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
588657342
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
-693835846
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
-738418960
bear the weight of your human weakness."
-2145941583

-1840324437
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
475436614
labours."
1224552385

-1840324437
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
-371503805
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
-1382010372
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
-480517698
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
-401317076

-1840324437
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
-472995663
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
-1097450155
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
-924664366
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
924964363
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
-64597309
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
485270806

-1840324437
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
-613526212
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
1439956548
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
-392392239
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
860715366
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
-479448299
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
-1808902250
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
-663976935
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
900357191
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
438023239
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
-491958521
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
1947491036
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
70625787
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
-1432216368
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
-409010467
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
523061337
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
-12868739
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
-1533986775
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
-1881014406
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
870591951
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
-922423133
be to me invaluable."
-628301293

-1840324437
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
691643210
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
-1137209175
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
-715789678
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
-1494547803
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
1234765512
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
209593442
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
-46513709

-1840324437
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
1765273358
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
1936693999

-1840324437
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:
-1163779954

1494448026

-1840324437
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
1924050817
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
-721145282
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
-932030589
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
1834127569
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
1035894853
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
354395720
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
-1200090882
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
-1702908596
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
-53889859
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
-863462566
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
-59214153
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
210886211
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
1782563088
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
26617693
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
-307138859
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
-1832061769
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
2012288036
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
-293231583
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
-302430392
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
-1490821094
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
-672034707
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
-332057230
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
-306177868
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
1585992716
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
629381870
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
-2069196947

-1840324437
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
-900576476
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
889038642
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
1233425407
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
1568048286
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
-24558472
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
-773310041
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
-781578914
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
-650857357
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
-150934319
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
1208277559
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
799558853
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
2099814376
I will tell him so."
350197110

-1840324437
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
1227101293
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
737002846
his feet and approached me.
1403339832

-1840324437
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
-415719343

-1840324437
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
-1305730151

-1840324437
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
-1171653784
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
-119930029

-1840324437
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
459405263
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
1558466373
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
527262549
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
-1117506998
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
-1005919577
sense will guide you."
-700439562

-1840324437
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
-409957392
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
-1678054399
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
-905099529
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
719724925
continue."
941770970

-1840324437
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
-1262442801
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
-520996905
have said that."
817644803

-1840324437
"Conditionally."
-1083380944

-1840324437
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
878863441
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
2093239313
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
-59786648
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
-36231109
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
1548011575
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
-1769140434
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
330889048
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
421903809
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
-1502765557
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
-1513602727
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
-1705780946

-1840324437
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
-1685325679
my limbs.
1238389879

-1840324437
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
1928828729

-1840324437
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
-573101357
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
-546551019
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
1494856042

-1840324437
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
-277132996
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
2099016209
them he has no use: I retain them."
-1250997378

-1840324437
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
-438642900
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
504024800
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
826352854
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
270542573

-1840324437
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
1581651267

-1840324437
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
-852407045
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
-814339111
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
-466494471
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
11603274
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
996572569
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
-1056264874
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
-578948318
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
1730269659
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
-1562442942
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
2083486051
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
-625163997
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
-1862601380
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
2143363582

-1840324437
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
-1392846206
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
1878172258

-1840324437
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
-1257873125
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
1458093425
this signify?"
1775588360

-1840324437
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
-228932314
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
-1901419273
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
-1180852909
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
1787948397
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
1035036921
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
1586211668
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
1814981556
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
-896012672
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
-2087679192
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
-1706992265
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
-1828148378
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
-488878245
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
-1268054759

-1840324437
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
1609126583
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
-76922081
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
2019495816
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
-1655801094
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
7234678
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
1388516691
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
1319175563
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
1986467143
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
1309652646
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
-2038269794
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
164626756
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
-522486598
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
-1182588049
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
-747433269
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
1542544431
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
-2045295316
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
367469626
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
-96636055
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
-509432772
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
-694628787
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
1265093100
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
-614505421

-1840324437
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
-136045031

-1840324437
"Well?" he answered icily.
-1966416430

-1840324437
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
-2001090268
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
463984594

-1840324437
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
-334451954
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
744826706
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
992641889
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
1913958597
tribes--and unwed?"
2141166686

-1840324437
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
-557289705
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
1800663193
yourself."
1445893810

-1840324437
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
533851819
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
1657230086
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
1127166413
heart and--it would not do."
-1269419091

-1840324437
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
-93803677
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
306163069
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
-1634645288
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
-640121525
nothing more--don't fear."
144889691

-1840324437
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
1376175115
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
-2125421666
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
-239489276
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
-2085681360
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
-1266261656
eyes."
-2092364793

-1840324437
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
-1371091310
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
-776853279
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
343376965
offer it."
-34178642

-1840324437
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
-2027984289
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
-1758484655
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
-974589808

-1840324437
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
1925566294
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
-1675414926

-1840324437
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
-1506876347

-1840324437
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
-540680618
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
-1731169625
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
-1797900100
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
-191194464
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
2137236971
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
100934724

-1840324437
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
-1296454623
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
-2046686668
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
1565158666
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
-1174784837
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
-626953651
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
2054609047
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
-1099198052
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
-682759608
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
-292437761
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
-2043947975

-1840324437
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
557727183

-1840324437
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
1076473579

-1840324437
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
231637866
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
-1301191880
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
1161633726
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
-1780514218
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
-504105121
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
-1843256324
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
1373754347
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
1642445431
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
-2082067601

-1840324437
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
2104989348
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
1006284998
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
1481175325
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
733231061

-1840324437
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
-1242199606
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
-1586019177
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
-325583321

-1840324437
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
-293366656
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
26781906
stairs.
-672549822

-1840324437
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
-311126200

-1840324437
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
-767053385

-1840324437
"Then shake hands," I added.
1460282653

-1840324437
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
1084081205
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
-703063316
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
636978063
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
1244728796
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
943012440
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
1110757346
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
1611366916

-1840324437
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
493333539
down.
-769424252

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXV
1184779507

-1840324437

-1840324437
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
-13883676
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
-111398332
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
846177066
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
-1524796509
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
-1185168157
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
1892391361

-1840324437
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
2106804933
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
282230877
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
-1725396685
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
1913263731
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
1409903665
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
-285754051
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
370883238
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
-974596497
echo toned every answer he gave me.
1324832753

-1840324437
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
2147332925
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
-1831964728
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
-669958034
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
1823824994
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
-116148981
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
1978713746
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
1892099915
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
-1506740073
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
707821463

-1840324437
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
-1010015724
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
846192429
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
1620123554
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
-1893758894
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
-1765610856
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
-716920623
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
563072384
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
-262647674
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
-1348934048
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
853786899
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
-1288542839
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
1697047176
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
-991226962
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
1763920198
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
1114744261

-1840324437
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
2019409948
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
-1759993118
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
-1233314684
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
-848627883
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
-1522721898
spoke to the point at once.
1617528364

-1840324437
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
1718675444
friends."
592938901

-1840324437
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
1871276081
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
1601285021

-1840324437
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
-821338507

-1840324437
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
954869459
good."
2078055702

-1840324437
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
-1166772134
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
-364696057
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
703852397
strangers."
864683399

-1840324437
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
-1107456221
regarding you as a stranger."
-1327357364

-1840324437
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
149981594
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
1636680653
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
1411462296
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
1614366326
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
350933585
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
288375275

-1840324437
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
992391666
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
2066327137

-1840324437
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
-700143653

-1840324437
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
-1829418818
India?"
-1586172612

-1840324437
"You said I could not unless I married you."
-1422908055

-1840324437
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
-997605274

-1840324437
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
185235007
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
-1453118529
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
347715003

-1840324437
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
-1825176226

-1840324437
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
1837902694
crash down.
-631245059

-1840324437
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
317428454

-1840324437
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
478069937
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
-309299914
You are killing me now."
-1517130069

-1840324437
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
760452516

-1840324437
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
415678383
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
-84288489
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
1762811992
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
-549480768
until seventy-and-seven times."
-635127512

-1840324437
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
1509005577
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
1162634397
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
-1275556228

-1840324437
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
-392971481
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
-1707105098

-1840324437
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
-285227963
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
-50918238
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
-2106339739

-1840324437
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
-903185863
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
-1390504434

-1840324437
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
-1668636815
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
1339678297
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
1245217889

-1840324437
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
1142330644

-1840324437
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
1450744661
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
873084715
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
-1729073619
spoke at last.
2106083764

-1840324437
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
-1373940012
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
795251947
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
-1283221496
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
1083131408
sake."
845175371

-1840324437
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
-1001852358
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
733068837
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
-1743498679
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
1810763928
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
1536364316
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
-1954167314

-1840324437
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
-718881814
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
136580025

-1840324437
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
-1728078075
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
541433903
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
1853689861
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
-6477219
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
330392145
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
-1213077866

-1840324437
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
-1477021250
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
77891289
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
-1662370196

-1840324437
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
-784003886
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
1716012641
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
995400764
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
-602986001
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
-1921156000

-1840324437
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
80416745

-1840324437
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
1840305447
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
-550644980
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
390570926
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
-2040237760
leaving it."
1474132771

-1840324437
"What do you mean?"
1241496554

-1840324437
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
-849157332
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
786622861
some means that doubt is removed."
-4452420

-1840324437
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
1288492960
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
-2048775375
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
-172108917
Rochester?"
-32067713

-1840324437
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
344193937

-1840324437
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
-1852651201

-1840324437
"I must find out what is become of him."
1868537009

-1840324437
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
405513706
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
-45313180
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
1188125972
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
-758611348

-1840324437
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
591589300
was soon out of sight.
342341329

-1840324437
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
-1845749879
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
-280217925
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
-499889069

-1840324437
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
-1099336871
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
-1306423170
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
1777053866
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
1442740676
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
163343305

-1840324437
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
186202673

-1840324437
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
-320285623
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
-1110975913
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
834367796
Jane?"
-1035289317

-1840324437
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
-979736628

-1840324437
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
1114748925
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
-1529255374
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
-2142455510

-1840324437
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
960819738

-1840324437
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
-507262861
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
891014076

-1840324437
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
-268322332
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
123170131

-1840324437
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
-2030786801

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
1632857024
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
-1639138854

-1840324437
"I have refused to marry him--"
94336561

-1840324437
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
728664047

-1840324437
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
1681983586
as his sister."
-1963225127

-1840324437
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
682787838
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
800620108
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
-335883326
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
-810902543
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
-2073817410
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
-277556700
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
828183026

-1840324437
"Not as a husband."
-1818719840

-1840324437
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
-1893328350

-1840324437
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
1706331703

-1840324437
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
166350014
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
1580635240
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
2053905241

-1840324437
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
-880221845
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
1529963583
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
-2102822318
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
1932135040
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
-1339989415

-1840324437
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
-84659274

-1840324437
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
-1623349414
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
-1909736832
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
-1563297118
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
-1509990936
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
469310680
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
1640196141

-1840324437
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
1765973824

-1840324437
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
1540484267
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
1842682868
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
1097016188
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
-924535775
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
-1969975024
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
-1389107433
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
-1165663802
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
2147213299

-1840324437
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
2017584707

-1840324437
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
-692505640
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
-824350818
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
585185798
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
-1612570087
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
-1012532799

-1840324437
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
2119317517
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
-1242229415
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
1033572874
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
712455222
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
1909270917
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
1996579570
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
-1341500554
had forgiven me once more.
-655571830

-1840324437
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
1641027779
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
1577812863
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
-2141582968
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
1314137340
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
1121449881
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
2073585020
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
-820220821
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
1119808042
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
1459785274
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
-503702455
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
1479929814
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
-1537918322
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
-168219671
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
-406714739

-1840324437
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
-471717158
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
63070336
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
145450966

-1840324437
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
-503299635
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
430620449
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
-1930813334
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
-1895218241

-1840324437
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
-1896840755

-1840324437
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
-905305
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
1879922373
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
-847476810
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
-633578682
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
-754364815
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
-389906611
Lamb is the light thereof.
359698375

-1840324437
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
-995640066
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
-1303895642
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
-1905338814
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
1086234554
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
592209563
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
610968953
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
1415457820
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
899100319
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
-634374069
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
587234270
could not but feel it too.
-1606034259

-1840324437
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
1335127785
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
-1326845631
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
-1750525108
and wished him a pleasant journey.
-772703122

-1840324437
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
-76997198
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
1612027519
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
2071336063
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
1235897996
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
-903231143
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
1083941125
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
1550505437
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
-1617891552
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
460076199
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
-1276372539
from you!"
732780801

-1840324437
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
-1929434208
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
2048658152
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
1062619872
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
924496367
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
-1667978186
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
-1100591134
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
652622807
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
-1557670676
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
-1639174542
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
696673102
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
-1325229052
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
1962889116
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
-1130275969
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
115712515
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
1839241889
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
-948001382

-1840324437
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
-879292926
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
334983218
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
-1662186894
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
112945844
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
1604765439
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
-1581524825
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
-1945684723
dim room was full of visions.
-210823087

-1840324437
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
1244610292
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
-233583134
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
163991039
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
1379878719
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
651746814
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
-1232441660
prayer: it was only elevated.
-761742825

-1840324437
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
1760770196
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
-563799398
and now--come afterwards what would!"
-614319481

-1840324437
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
-99132155
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
-1929195421
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
1912235412
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
1188657288
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
-1050179070
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
1918565767
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
1243225590
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
-2138841132
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
-1096936639
shall judge.
-42150863

-1840324437
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
-1584024643
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
1315121765
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
-244375712
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
144141561
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
-1045389764
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
2125824606
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
1491925309
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
-439832109
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
317015332
bones.
754600643

-1840324437
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
273077541
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
889198229

-1840324437
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
-564062106

-1840324437
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
1610282478

-1840324437
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
1916060356
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
-1918794897
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
868821260
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
248206342
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
1799271551
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
-730150520

-1840324437
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
1947923700
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
1278457827
garden: it was void.
364752214

-1840324437
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
132603884

-1840324437
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
-1917340248
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
-846521131
loneliness and midnight hush.
-2057754901

-1840324437
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
-470483833
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
1872463983
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
-941854834
best."
1809911142

-1840324437
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
-535414827
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
1583411025
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
-1981306267
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
-1062247160
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
-1161374954
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
-487606483
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
-796583874
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
-972999797
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
-1653089134
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
1125467910

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXVI
511572311

-1840324437

-1840324437
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
1185434462
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
260656780
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
-586614151
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
480289620
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
50091655
I took it up.  It bore these words--
-885069415

-1840324437
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
-209568241
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
-940155686
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
351037803
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
1561066843
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
-1802984360
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
-460388485

-1840324437
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
814566599
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
2082391943
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
-1312872911
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
1517464800
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
-1229558626

-1840324437
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
-80915500
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
-1354883033
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
372609371
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
-72258815
would meet the coach.
-684231710

-1840324437
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
-752748635
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
-104079600
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
-414937274

-1840324437
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
-1066931017
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
1802389500
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
-158451538
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
667086371
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
743015868
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
-1988694097
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
135072142
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
716919578
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
-804338602
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
-447222701
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
375493648
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
-1604023875
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
25523162
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
-2105463878
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
-1416602542
body.
1387113304

-1840324437
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
824326549
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
-2134652907
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
-1848234719

-1840324437
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
649409365
and should be absent at least four days.
-494463140

-1840324437
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
-759488891

-1840324437
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
283378471
time been uneasy."
1646718816

-1840324437
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
409326920
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
-1948892226
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
503428868
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
-105689764
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
142457450
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
691718061

-1840324437
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
1726295373
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
1312729324
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
1246028380
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
784443711
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
-1886596167

-1840324437
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
435767372
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
1649908447
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
1911258358
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
311387828
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
1987034337
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
640581966
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
1595668018
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
-2109662711
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
-961122270

-1840324437
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
-872953763
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
92080875
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
-1184390221
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
-173976155
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
-1652858871
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
-424050209
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
928061896
we were near my bourne.
-1300747537

-1840324437
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
-525721776

-1840324437
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
2004663283

-1840324437
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
527261395
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
451498983
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
500636341
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
62167199
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
434598037
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
2123007406

-1840324437
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
1445992944
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
-353590744
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
-1654013867
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
1334564381
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
1278185801
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
-1601192527
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
-870344499
Mr. Rochester be at home."
-1891542677

-1840324437
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
1819536590
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
-238575378
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
-11363641
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
953927196
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
1433015405
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
-631052357
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
-906639147
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
1831465132
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
-145398020
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
495855543
them!
34063847

-1840324437
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
1590835355
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
1671446673
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
-547441145
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
-60860419
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
-1487600467
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
305561398
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
-1428669139
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
942409638
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
228624773
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
-1384264342
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
1135894491
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
-1065150318
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
-850990292
tideless sea of the south."
-820390952

-1840324437
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
1353484854
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
-28067892
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
-1990215015
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
688211762
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
-1560119357
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
-393573660
station were at my command.
985339248

-1840324437
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
362943070
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
-1323885718
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
1366600262
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
-1991191812
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
-862779045
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
676363370
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
621075141
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
2021318281

-1840324437
Hear an illustration, reader.
507472542

-1840324437
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
1413207401
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
324745853
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
383937858
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
-705887995
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
-1459197164
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
771422498
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
-1640818511
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
-1039205655
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
-343302657
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
-547107246
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
-1891228395
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
1903555911
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
-2118293448

-1840324437
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
-258562997
ruin.
-1090672583

-1840324437
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
1610180359
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
1266695353
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
1262024956
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
-968114376
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
-124550145
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
689810886
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
-1022607415

-1840324437
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
472724587
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
859398667
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
1496551952
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
767996348
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
-1025640692
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
492415508
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
-602716440
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
-261399905
token.
1871361794

-1840324437
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
359675752
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
426863535
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
-1997152369
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
-1967829191
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
-765092849
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
-181146658
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
1514875826
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
-1682207946
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
-1497289639
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
2123531420

-1840324437
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
-312651255
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
-472461572
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
166463082
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
654011300
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
1433148232
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
540988232
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
25453712

-1840324437
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
796484010

-1840324437
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
-1825818942

-1840324437
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
-2137919741

-1840324437
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
856434822

-1840324437
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
1206175899
trying to evade.
1671190297

-1840324437
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
1282996276

-1840324437
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
-1192554635
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
-1871484268
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
-1263336887
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
-1686581097
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
1454146089
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
323437936
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
-1594051027
Antipodes.
1427902428

-1840324437
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
2013622886
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
-1806143916
direct question as to where he really was.
-1049141326

-1840324437
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
888250203
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
-410647106
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
2034839440
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
-728009967
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
-313596135
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
387413294
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
2098824148
witnessed it myself."
949214237

-1840324437
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
-1295337153
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
-427399357

-1840324437
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
-499266301
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
1384899740
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
478238342
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
-947995133

-1840324437
"I have heard something of it."
-675468488

-1840324437
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
506011454
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
-604173449
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
-315681366
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
-856753599
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
-1492955024
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
-1667018540

-1840324437
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
1730911789
main fact.
992997715

-1840324437
"And this lady?"
772151196

-1840324437
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
-320683113
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
1821278676
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
783668127

-1840324437
"But the fire," I suggested.
-479355282

-1840324437
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
2026217558
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
-431722855
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
-771294028
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
-1594942171
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
1741793078
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
2027116088
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
-1584332580
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
1590955337
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
-1322448088
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
-1026025751

-1840324437
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
-362086297
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
-1864761073
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
-897213400

-1840324437
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
1608561650
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
-534730498
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
-1849563632
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
1508694320
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
811650180
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
-1102671852
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
-1250641557
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
-291963719
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
-2102149374
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
-1016126922
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
1572332784
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
-1903764431
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
917482817
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
-480207409
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
1956848810
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
1240926407
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
-1140118167
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
51320424
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
-1244397935
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
-502232304
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
1763142309
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
1825935751
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
228984014
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
-1629994414
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
-296046386
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
-2058522986

-1840324437
"What! did he not leave England?"
-1529089461

-1840324437
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
-1377338745
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
-615687905
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
-1130434596
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
-36723467
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
-1260429220
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
1078085749
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
-1553623450
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
381407814
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
1413461235
Thornfield Hall."
594586910

-1840324437
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
-1960726351

-1840324437
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
1016348798
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
1423363025
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
1264678076
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
1801146490
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
1407348003
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
1424579993
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
-1873614501
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
-50493785
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
-824520912
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
-1950914140
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
-992089902
pavement."
-2127906796

-1840324437
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
-292642431

-1840324437
"Dead?"
1980006325

-1840324437
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
1213122728
scattered."
1648379255

-1840324437
"Good God!"
1250021998

-1840324437
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
-901994616

-1840324437
He shuddered.
-682133494

-1840324437
"And afterwards?" I urged.
48579779

-1840324437
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
2053325616
only some bits of walls standing now."
-2061972928

-1840324437
"Were any other lives lost?"
553389153

-1840324437
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
960533009

-1840324437
"What do you mean?"
1241496554

-1840324437
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
-1289375222
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
425294535
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
731294168
pity him, for my part."
205454377

-1840324437
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
403612729

-1840324437
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
2076805557

-1840324437
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
906145026
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
341778544

-1840324437
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
889487911
fixture now."
910087969

-1840324437
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
-872696220

-1840324437
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
-2105063457
Edward."
-2087072040

-1840324437
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
688219833
ask what had caused this calamity.
406788012

-1840324437
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
2074559904
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
145833111
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
284404659
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
-1645205454
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
-1850998539
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
675491501
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
614228011
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
-198380671
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
-1209673044

-1840324437
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
-1307346640

-1840324437
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
-235135192
quite a desolate spot."
1952612508

-1840324437
"Who is with him?"
-1748324889

-1840324437
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
1523670706
down, they say."
991568044

-1840324437
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
1453074914

-1840324437
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
-1288329447

-1840324437
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
248667372
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
-665225828
you usually demand."

CHAPTER XXXVII
1344960845

-1840324437

-1840324437
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
-619662671
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
-974680361
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
-1838326462
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
-1119434237
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
-1830553688
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
572191026
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
-1340984030
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
-751476076
there in the season to shoot.
-1012712308

-1840324437
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
124661905
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
327594730
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
313931539
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
-1739471736
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
-1223325055
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
-1529340787
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
1583946819
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
171223075
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
1127825663
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
-1069479648
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
-521418926
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
-848465640

-1840324437
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
-1684313018
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
1698106021
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
-1764587737
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
948187736

-1840324437
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
-599119846
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
837402870
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
269487746
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
-1693870669
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
-1152524712
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
483936476
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
412005939
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
1746798650
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
-1573859742
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
1571975710
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
-479219984
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
1312787517

-1840324437
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
1655743435

-1840324437
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
312563142
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
-530683577
grange.
-2042993127

-1840324437
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
941702736
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
66577350
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
-1705208237
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
-1603201094

-1840324437
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
-927737123
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
1927348805
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
1407275746
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
1085895391
advance.
719132424

-1840324437
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
-20754065
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
742436895
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
-1733328780
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
-1826369418
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
1771146930
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
1283761449
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
496664404
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
-1170574007

-1840324437
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
928912587
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
-1412093112
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
1323484070
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
917376690

-1840324437
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
786989028
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
1803871743
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
-404211306
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
1522901879
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
-1605199331
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
587667845
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
983584940
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
1117066083
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
-647226507
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
-1772492115
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
439162815

-1840324437
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
-641704746
had you not better go in?"
-215426301

-1840324437
"Let me alone," was the answer.
2135206248

-1840324437
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
-1372077904
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
1492980512
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
-735961197

-1840324437
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
-1001609839
"how are you?"
896357501

-1840324437
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
-1809563793
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
-1982183096
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
-193771122
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
986249929
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
-84946801
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
2134511586
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
-1493170871
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
-651341728
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
-191888129
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
-187503434
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
-1522782189
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
1746913987

-1840324437
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
63174195
to him, but do not give my name."
-718727868

-1840324437
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
-1299089114

-1840324437
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
1111633827
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
1497278755
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
-409415640

-1840324437
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
-1533697032

-1840324437
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
-749395915

-1840324437
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
-468079187

-1840324437
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
570366552
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
-1780772367
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
110084660

-1840324437
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
324037326
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
777754708
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
-1886506046
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
2047264697
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
-709341971
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
-143876173
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
-799644455
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
-1196571755
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
891611406
nothing, he returned and sighed.
-2026361782

-1840324437
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
-945211260

-1840324437
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
-1014506627
still excited.
1644549123

-1840324437
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
991060189

-1840324437
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
-77587794
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
-41547176
you, Mary, is it not?"
-1192849269

-1840324437
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
-1272844326

-1840324437
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
-1656128393
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
-763574843
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
251171983
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
561386583
and aloud.
-1126471747

-1840324437
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
1097367939
glass," I said.
-1483890906

-1840324437
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
577102183

-1840324437
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
-379351951
evening," I answered.
942358646

-1840324437
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
-1970841362
seized me?"
-511580900

-1840324437
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
806708472
your health too sound for frenzy."
2146791556

-1840324437
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
741431111
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
-930978461
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
53521968

-1840324437
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
1249961155

-1840324437
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
100071668
must be more of her."
-896740444

-1840324437
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
296560637
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
437279531

-1840324437
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
409688993

-1840324437
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
665869589
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
975595127

-1840324437
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
523439420

-1840324437
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
-125924218
come back to you."
849859972

-1840324437
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
-1431712714

-1840324437
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
-2053038387
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
-1011561963

-1840324437
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
1846891090
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
194172859
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
-920058002
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
-1158792905
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
-1424100176

-1840324437
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
1820578522

-1840324437
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
1488912591
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
665222975
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
-1220396140
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
2035926381
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
1194241275
you go--embrace me, Jane."
-2026606250

-1840324437
"There, sir--and there!"'
-1297531143

-1840324437
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
-627495205
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
1019542590
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
2135143894

-1840324437
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
102343217

-1840324437
"I am."
-1590565089

-1840324437
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
795936537
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
848542317

-1840324437
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
-1833383945

-1840324437
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
766316246

-1840324437
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
85053398

-1840324437
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
1219687290
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
-1514616266
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
1855570092
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
418584195

-1840324437
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
-535375353
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
1835967266
company of an evening."
1903429608

-1840324437
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
-528122287
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
-599766790
me?"
2081976871

-1840324437
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
1485057197
mistress."
-1575473061

-1840324437
"And you will stay with me?"
-327488634

-1840324437
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
-636136625
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
-678251310
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
-1676985490
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
-359069658
be left desolate, so long as I live."
1950316895

-1840324437
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
-1852379100
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
-1514969773
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
-1687974120
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
509289759
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
-1953614563
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
-779368401
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
1939025784
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
-26600560
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
1049823154
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
1924803663
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
2018661400

-1840324437
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
944831271
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
1000899712
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
-1468666526
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
-1675231399
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
1538779145
vengeance on its frame."
1144250955

-1840324437
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
199768776

-1840324437
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
-1745058631
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
335725308
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
-1304176905
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
-444824915
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
1132145280
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
-787602075
Come--tell me."
418659381

-1840324437
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
511252558
you think it better."
1204841923

-1840324437
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
1053352091
one day."
-1850412666

-1840324437
"I don't care about being married."
915541030

-1840324437
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
-126379150
you care--but--a sightless block!"
1959338803

-1840324437
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
-1760909348
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
-826118787
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
367431920
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
-1480995579
conversation.
1284517822

-1840324437
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
-396706230
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
-1702551273
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
1064903717
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
1089254186
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
1068317956
not yet noticed."
-1323738711

-1840324437
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
-1571641628
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
-243935663
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
-367014362

-1840324437
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
477404966
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
1037912969
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
-278362212

-1840324437
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
1515935635
cicatrised visage."
-296585413

-1840324437
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
-1076012351
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
1824812081
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
-1180552589

-1840324437
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
464969634

-1840324437
"And you see the candles?"
-1482871154

-1840324437
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
-17328203

-1840324437
"Can you see me?"
1409686632

-1840324437
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
-764055756

-1840324437
"When do you take supper?"
-487909912

-1840324437
"I never take supper."
1557719612

-1840324437
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
1996527523
only you forget."
-1411070856

-1840324437
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
-1299556025
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
-1317505609
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
1152692343
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
18641747
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
-1384553508
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
-1969306720
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
-777795531
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
-1788377195
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
-904304293
lineaments softened and warmed.
-200905541

-1840324437
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
518235488
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
1387423616
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
868082701
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
-600042305
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
1734146469
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
-920657850
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
77410192

-1840324437
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
-1443456765

-1840324437
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
-71042227
p422.jpg}
-1556991235

-1840324437
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
-745105265

-1840324437
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
1737392399
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
-1449316028
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
1309611996
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
1243565059

-1840324437
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
-1328905090

-1840324437
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
-299925719
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
-72461232
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
-1924882654
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
-104463398
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
2006156148
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
-402544391
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
408093411
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
36435762
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
1683818037

-1840324437
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
-2050180680
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
-2043723194
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
-1334537910
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
423333274
them grow as broad and black as ever.
599090040

-1840324437
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
-1888202977
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
391154696
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
-1293251211
undiscoverable?
109294243

-1840324437
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
1257572675

-1840324437
"What for, Jane?"
-1319050091

-1840324437
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
1104581417
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
1155672688
sure, you are more like a brownie."
535168941

-1840324437
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
-1273700010

-1840324437
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
1415952017

-1840324437
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
-1863983103
sojourned."
1783575452

-1840324437
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
-1151919587
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
1266007783
life: quite more refined and exalted."
2033447908

-1840324437
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
-783845596

-1840324437
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
-1693335168
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
-1531568257
substantiality."
1414857976

-1840324437
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
1662980512

-1840324437
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
-1119216091
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
-41434401
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
-42032333
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
-806454538
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
-796275183
ham."
1327706540

-1840324437
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
34231654
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
1814002373
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
-57401553
harp."
-2100534501

-1840324437
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
-1317521131
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
-123682348
night."
995606384

-1840324437
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
-359640928
been?"
1902305838

-1840324437
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
-476170600
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
-152307787
of his melancholy for some time to come."
2041533248

-1840324437
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
-1805046076
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
1824925286
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
-590951412
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
-1832482237

-1840324437
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
-2101415569
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
-1884084827
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
-1811969812
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
-287793802
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
404544803
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
1439764121
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
-1708817254
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
808337875
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
-1704107576
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
2073384978
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
-1247125648

-1840324437
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
1428085111
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
-1258907772
soon."
1379624923

-1840324437
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
106882651

-1840324437
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
1524289874
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
-193351791
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
152508293
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
1208031627
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
1834331714
can feel is in her presence."
-1839960128

-1840324437
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
-992445770
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
-1309177386
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
1436648558
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
-1932313298

-1840324437
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
1033938076
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
-323305039
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
1952783223
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
1413109341
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
-86458006
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
-868431737
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
1671506440
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
1716738629

-1840324437
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
132864299
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
1677601938
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
-1352783286
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
412863125
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
-1743607448
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
1448259513
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
1344162490
she do?  Let me hear now."
-1401529447

-1840324437
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
-2090095072
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
-1274884637
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
953591788
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
-1759624822
deeper than I wished.
-1413204848

-1840324437
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
-1524679547
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
119166542
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
855342316
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
-1072555890
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
1009947498
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
-1448084046
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
193146855
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
-1996529056

-1840324437
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
-2128664673
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
-904721756
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
-1579803874
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
635576099
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
2061581564
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
-171835060
up.
-452062643

-1840324437
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
-620977187

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
-1125792241

-1840324437
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
-1028517384

-1840324437
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
796410578
Or what does it mean?"
-2006479185

-1840324437
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
379903640

-1840324437
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
352741960
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
393118482
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
-1581542235

-1840324437
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
108500979
perform."
-589836061

-1840324437
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
-1897530607
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
301371945

-1840324437
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
1282335256
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
-189918919

-1840324437
"Is he an able man, then?"
1287511312

-1840324437
"Truly able."
1253326295

-1840324437
"A thoroughly educated man?"
-180265345

-1840324437
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
1891822660

-1840324437
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
-284687135
parsonic?"
-1346724815

-1840324437
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
2054066784
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
1456357989

-1840324437
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
1811365646
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
-2057277917
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
-1884089372

-1840324437
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
-394174085
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
-708302548

-1840324437
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
895190751

-1840324437
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
2093938724

-1840324437
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
460793245
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
397110318
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
518962372
immediately charm the snake.
-1272213912

-1840324437
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
2026773872
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
478304235

-1840324437
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
150032086

-1840324437
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
-753921156
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
989252706
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
-1774894357
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
-914778963
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
-998531404
bargain."
-88906938

-1840324437
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
1997049332
sir."
319795494

-1840324437
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
-2131186550
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
2066572681
question or two."  He paused.
-1515626690

-1840324437
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
1952527437

-1840324437
Then followed this cross-examination.
45578745

-1840324437
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
1901625446
cousin?"
1488100474

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
2013061788

-1840324437
"Daily."
1577097987

-1840324437
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
1370000956
you are a talented creature!"
1786732797

-1840324437
"He approved of them--yes."
-794541388

-1840324437
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
1996274187
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
-2064540611

-1840324437
"I don't know about that."
-1587361799

-1840324437
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
846781613
there to see you?"
-1082832989

-1840324437
"Now and then?"
-1718475689

-1840324437
"Of an evening?"
-205278668

-1840324437
"Once or twice."
1892352524

-1840324437
A pause.
-1682144522

-1840324437
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
988329992
was discovered?"
-896590390

-1840324437
"Five months."
2107535999

-1840324437
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
96398465

-1840324437
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
1163627693
window, and we by the table."
312424493

-1840324437
"Did he study much?"
-100040657

-1840324437
"A good deal."
-1945594408

-1840324437
"What?"
-160914463

-1840324437
"Hindostanee."
-1725271541

-1840324437
"And what did you do meantime?"
1927807863

-1840324437
"I learnt German, at first."
-297531708

-1840324437
"Did he teach you?"
-250595688

-1840324437
"He did not understand German."
1928902052

-1840324437
"Did he teach you nothing?"
1398307148

-1840324437
"A little Hindostanee."
-2037364507

-1840324437
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
2088805447

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"And his sisters also?"
-1541878850

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"Only you?"
-1318413064

-1840324437
"Only me."
915424620

-1840324437
"Did you ask to learn?"
1110713875

-1840324437
"No."
-1103378224

-1840324437
"He wished to teach you?"
1704530611

-1840324437
"Yes."
288188899

-1840324437
A second pause.
-1801290339

-1840324437
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
486231024

-1840324437
"He intended me to go with him to India."
-811783517

-1840324437
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
-163213688

-1840324437
"He asked me to marry him."
-857620006

-1840324437
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
-822779669

-1840324437
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
1724296882
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
2119713387

-1840324437
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
1647996500
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
-1331749774
have given you notice to quit?"
442055173

-1840324437
"Because I am comfortable there."
440731347

-1840324437
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
694114816
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
1820393843
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
37006591
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
1577860187
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
1972086188
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
1763405644
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
-1576944292

-1840324437
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
-1954658860
accord."
-1813209601

-1840324437
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
645415160
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
-933906104
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
-1832916700

-1840324437
"Where must I go, sir?"
-625596887

-1840324437
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
-960436885

-1840324437
"Who is that?"
-1691289433

-1840324437
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
1204549200

-1840324437
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
121475720
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
-980024707
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
-459032383
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
-805096158
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
-1301824988
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
-1800860420
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
481365023
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
1664760591
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
-52273443

-1840324437
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
1350529192
beloved master.  He smiled.
1872678040

-1840324437
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
1035031054
you and Rivers?"
1561673953

-1840324437
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
-1566835434
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
1558661995
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
-432569922
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
-1382805100
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
-586228775
of me from your presence for ever."
468624558

-1840324437
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
-597996534

-1840324437
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
-1127683959

-1840324437
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
-624415254
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
-610263702
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
1807641434
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
-1970293017

-1840324437
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
765675666
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
-201633214
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
-1160406263

-1840324437
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
-205558892
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
-1048903000
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
572178868
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
1656140998
offers them so safe a prop."
353517379

-1840324437
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
-1411406156

-1840324437
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
1500092224

-1840324437
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
-574660486
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
1750597126
helped me.
-479471820

-1840324437
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
1894358854

-1840324437
"Do you, sir?"
-1903636231

-1840324437
"Yes: is it news to you?"
294776557

-1840324437
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
2050048699

-1840324437
"Is it unwelcome news?"
243479903

-1840324437
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
-314465024

-1840324437
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
-1658808931

-1840324437
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
1105216063

-1840324437
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
252866789

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
1511529576

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
2047116138
on?"
78474818

-1840324437
"Yes, sir."
-253641668

-1840324437
"Truly, Jane?"
1257668309

-1840324437
"Most truly, sir."
341649612

-1840324437
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
-2066411207

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
-1542173420
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
260139701
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
2001041658
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
362764687

-1840324437
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
1053692280

-1840324437
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
-72223066
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
1423665387
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
-2013754461
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
-736062013

-1840324437
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
359232831

-1840324437
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
-1795426331
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
1132657136
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
303243426

-1840324437
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
-1011968041
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
-808834880
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
-2026124902
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
121890859
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
2071143593
her?"
-970359951

-1840324437
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
1498485860

-1840324437
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
853115958
married instantly."
-28920430

-1840324437
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
-1849624361

-1840324437
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
333416431
licence to get--then we marry."
308122004

-1840324437
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
-789758972
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
-503942419
your watch."
-2047276017

-1840324437
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
-175457330
use for it."
-97923927

-1840324437
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
503273644
hungry?"
1405337779

-1840324437
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
1317028624
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
838616391

-1840324437
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
487785987
is quite hot."
1510461092

-1840324437
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
1511876229
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
1587958350
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
363677340

-1840324437
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
-1620999210

-1840324437
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
-1330324108

-1840324437
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
-1884600302
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
-768734195
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
-553011928
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
-1309932779
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
1218723559
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
-488725002
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
158013451
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
1833561833
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
-1562342037
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
1727283606
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
-801765273
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
-423545870
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
-527099103
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
781762064
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
1574633858

-1840324437
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
-1672408461
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
1153552966
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
2070093554
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
527091342
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
1792240411
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
1137682504
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
-1150063548
rejoining Jane.
227066541

-1840324437
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
1973459107
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
935454000
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
1381152487
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
516915883
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
1189063813
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
878416829
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
-739181026
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
-1242137283
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
-1071366581
Jane!  Jane!'"
2036566892

-1840324437
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
-1521620415

-1840324437
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
1138075376
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
1096265155

-1840324437
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
278159966

-1840324437
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
277966953
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
-1943630212
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
-1315239130
that I heard what I now relate.
136756531

-1840324437
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
-1887338685
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
-1384333634
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
-2017185516
are you?'
240242826

-1840324437
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
1604787248
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
-803346671
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
1108426408
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
465575718
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
85922542
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
-861806841
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
321074920
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
-1470067759
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
160908313
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
603335249

-1840324437
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
-398895706
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
-175916888
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
-888894974
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
-84473046
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
-103036114
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
-325583221
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
-772194250
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
806193963
them in my heart.
-396071338

-1840324437
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
-1421513937
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
356570211
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
2072730363
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
1554970721
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
-244113857
God!"
-350755777

-1840324437
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
-16639896
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
-2000657370
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
69725507

-1840324437
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
1047039810
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
-171949488
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
-1132776227

-1840324437
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
1015755529
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
1066832383
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
1408441872
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
-1190535005

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437

-1840324437
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
-196027685

-1840324437

-1840324437
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
-738087336
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
-1875438836
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
371310084
cleaning the knives, and I said--
-1820775798

-1840324437
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
1600373871
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
-1103221829
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
-1087991621
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
2105800494
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
259751019
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
-263478123
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
-1308753278
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
-1050036258
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
-1701426799
again over the roast, said only--
-218434689

-1840324437
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
1703993340

-1840324437
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
969160748
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
1265542376
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
-570768578

-1840324437
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
-1813480395
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
292805440
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
240099574
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
-1551984154
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
1997803236
politely pulled his forelock.
-1342327695

-1840324437
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
1132499787
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
2014760970
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
-1167038410
caught the words--
1823460936

-1840324437
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
2011436169
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
419897673
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
-1481269161

-1840324437
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
-608569981
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
-685748804
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
1053388058
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
-2053860715

-1840324437
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
-530707547
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
-1827542086
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
597140918
grave or mine."
-294159616

-1840324437
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
1690754502
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
-588712290
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
-204536464
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
-891805862
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
-1240659105
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
187845830
the world, and only mind earthly things.
-1202284862

-1840324437
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
216485692
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
-128853043
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
-1318090548
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
-249677577
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
-674975677
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
1669179779
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
-389597591
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
838305576
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
-1541860386
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
1502305976
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
1966187670
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
-658158658
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
-2046832241
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
1193839699
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
-392246214
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
-1869727957
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
1834829274
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
-16487077

-1840324437
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
-1670321502
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
-324093026
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
-1157875283

-1840324437
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
-1974160728
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
1311632292
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
-784429886
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
-96753428
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
2122016994
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
171340185
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
-209658965
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
-1512363916
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
-1319169588
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
1724315621
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
-1980028189
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
2053958638
concord is the result.
-1301812851

-1840324437
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
508877909
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
-760882599
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
-273968452
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
-1453109281
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
902728831
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
-1066896441
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
-1869326179
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
-1247948413
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
-551577537
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
805810610
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
928362921
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
1397105812
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
-2014281391
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
2104334371
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
-760255927

-1840324437
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
1158818580
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
274238832
glittering ornament round your neck?"
576643853

-1840324437
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
201124288

-1840324437
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
-1422845452

-1840324437
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
-400785722

-1840324437
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
-1116147103
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
-1991747748
sure of it.
99725068

-1840324437
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
342038071
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
804407936
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
-1851189495
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
-1641718762
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
-991115141
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
-131010060
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
324987759
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
-1212153518

-1840324437
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
-1309725789
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
-1095074683
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
26270379
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
496401693
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
-1640619470
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
690876690
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
1029720151

-1840324437
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
-1568953967
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
-2001804113
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
577067163
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
87173202
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
162832512
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
1870051834
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
-1658692445
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
1203474807
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
1234039762
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
-1683092208
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
45150124
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
378534365
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
-391408065
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
769002140
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
1181416212

-1840324437
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
1543530309
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
1653896568
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
903047406
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
333371251
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
-822926327
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
527723767
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
614289707
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
-2122859533
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
-255498756
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
-48350831

-1840324437
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
-1897235378
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
-1511373563
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
1317544396
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists

people in all walks of life.
1188449842

-1840324437

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

-1840324437
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
621523074
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
-1764598949
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
-82356559
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
-448031286
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
1614986869
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
-860713631
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
9058614
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
2034730617
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
-499628731
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
404323982
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
-837250123
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
-1664330520

-1840324437
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
-1972583459
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
-1085821076
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
