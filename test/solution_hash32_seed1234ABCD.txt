PREFACE
-403599095

-1923438341

-1923438341
A preface to the first edition of "Jane Eyre" being unnecessary, I gave
1942524309
none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and
554594735
miscellaneous remark.
-1492820544

-1923438341
My thanks are due in three quarters.
-1639441732

-1923438341
To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with
161243771
few pretensions.
-1595205025

-1923438341
To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an
103482310
obscure aspirant.
629979024

-1923438341
To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical
1286760733
sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended
628955737
Author.
-1452159292

-1923438341
The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I
1780314502
must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are
1005453285
certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and
1915698953
high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them,
-1146487400
_i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially,
1556696633
Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
-930826572

-1923438341
Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me,
-865397961
I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not,
1955683500
therefore, to be overlooked.  I mean the timorous or carping few who
-823015274
doubt the tendency of such books as "Jane Eyre:" in whose eyes whatever
591429547
is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against
-1858938554
bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on
-1416554163
earth.  I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I
1145634164
would remind them of certain simple truths.
386912728

-1923438341
Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To
-77507698
attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the
-1749774187
face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of
1300952576
Thorns.
-1451214859

-1923438341
These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as
559722274
is vice from virtue.  Men too often confound them: they should not be
503297055
confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human
1722863246
doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be
-135199400
substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.  There is--I repeat
-497938876
it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly
529675995
and clearly the line of separation between them.
-864972780

-1923438341
The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been
744176481
accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show
-308875793
pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean
-1155155536
shrines.  It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the
-1475706593
gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and
-2000130342
reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.
-1519785264

-1923438341
Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning
-416348655
him, but evil; probably he liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better;
154940508
yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears
1820140895
to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
1118305184

-1923438341
There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle
1517049579
delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of
-1429471108
society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah
-180114220
and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like
-643371526
and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.  Is the satirist of
-621387321
"Vanity Fair" admired in high places?  I cannot tell; but I think if some
1790736943
of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over
41685572
whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his
1363756425
warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal
260096016
Rimoth-Gilead.
-23859261

-1923438341
Why have I alluded to this man?  I have alluded to him, Reader, because I
1264576533
think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his
1597701464
contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first
-366430548
social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps
-1456525211
who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I
-1276255971
think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that
-1534585064
suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.  They say he
1318565092
is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.  He
-143407256
resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on
-2081270395
carrion, but Thackeray never does.  His wit is bright, his humour
-580920556
attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that
-96965037
the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-
-658363625
cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.  Finally, I have
-129581267
alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him--if he will accept the tribute
-1588728802
of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of "JANE EYRE."

NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
-434326793

-1923438341

-1923438341
I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of "Jane Eyre"
944385490
affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my
-910569419
claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.  If,
-1666674651
therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed
-1137657244
to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently,
1939773865
denied where it is justly due.
382609675

-1923438341
This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have
-2018213236
been made, and to prevent future errors.

CHAPTER I
363905422

-1923438341

-1923438341
There was no possibility of taking a walk that day.  We had been
2129437060
wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but
-939479487
since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold
-1559451354
winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so
2027798041
penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
-1164291972

-1923438341
I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
-1515712200
afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with
-101341738
nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie,
654385886
the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to
2035443766
Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
-807639510

-1923438341
The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
887578201
in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with
479774283
her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying)
2121320981
looked perfectly happy.  Me, she had dispensed from joining the group;
228218675
saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a
-1367735215
distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her
168760592
own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a
136120632
more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly
-343059725
manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really
1590973489
must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy,
-555718872
little children."
1168117472

-1923438341
"What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
1778179015

-1923438341
"Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something
1489327502
truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be
1149689572
seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent."
-1401976940

-1923438341
A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there.  It
2142274099
contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
-1058248017
that it should be one stored with pictures.  I mounted into the window-
-1649144616
seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having
1032128099
drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double
-899675900
retirement.
-130325454

-1923438341
Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
1135860897
were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the
-1333294856
drear November day.  At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my
-1110763369
book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.  Afar, it offered a
-119509139
pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
2061811443
shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and
950476091
lamentable blast.
-2143616787

-1923438341
I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress
-1086988088
thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were
1780631221
certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
-613044644
as a blank.  They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
-2140164098
"the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only inhabited; of the
-531578732
coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the
-154384839
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
-353371240

-1923438341
   "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
-91093011
   Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
730282450
   Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
-1384260092
   Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
-1879196793

-1923438341
Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
1465205872
Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with "the vast
-2114409221
sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that
2003854145
reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation
1588215046
of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround
-1027012554
the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold."  Of
8841686
these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all
-63695667
the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains,
1430265810
but strangely impressive.  The words in these introductory pages
-881676577
connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance
-1632341369
to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken
-2124156766
boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing
615018121
through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
922301239

-1923438341
I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with
-926498832
its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
154644873
girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
1925951940
hour of eventide.
-25145928

-1923438341
The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.
-2067236381

-1923438341
The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
-2099918065
quickly: it was an object of terror.
1738015163

-1923438341
So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant
1232900301
crowd surrounding a gallows.
-191451500

-1923438341
Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
852844537
understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as
-486815558
interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings,
-139466778
when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her
-1789206946
ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and
1758309981
while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap
402386250
borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure
2317511
taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I
-1204229211
discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
178862335

-1923438341
With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.  I
-1085875121
feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon.  The breakfast-
-953038489
room door opened.
1242215255

-1923438341
"Boh!  Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
-1202700069
found the room apparently empty.
1804965365

-1923438341
"Where the dickens is she!" he continued.  "Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to
1193980880
his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad
-1947896133
animal!"
-7068543

-1923438341
"It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
-94401081
might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
1264899087
himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just
-583596114
put her head in at the door, and said at once--
1442571062

-1923438341
"She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
337588795

-1923438341
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
830652339
forth by the said Jack.
200442163

-1923438341
"What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
545059872

-1923438341
"Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer.  "I want you to
-927147583
come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
-2007393691
gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
-163812046

-1923438341
John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I,
-932518580
for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
1550325198
unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and
1504594474
large extremities.  He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him
-896360409
bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.  He ought
-2099647783
now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
1055904102
or two, "on account of his delicate health."  Mr. Miles, the master,
1523045295
affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats
-1564717840
sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so
1688997743
harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's
-139513321
sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after
-2137985471
home.
-624473261

-1923438341
John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy
-1795838200
to me.  He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week,
1341671669
nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared
-920599770
him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
1787311856
There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired,
570616572
because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his
-710887491
inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by
-964947069
taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
1413092207
subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
1922185619
both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, however, behind
987184537
her back.
-1076070681

-1923438341
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
2064322831
minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without
1886144346
damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the
1263884617
blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would
-2034076749
presently deal it.  I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all
-751588980
at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly.  I tottered,
-34513934
and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his
1496135976
chair.
-1026366147

-1923438341
"That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
904144920
"and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
1432683036
you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
690755861

-1923438341
Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
-354505383
my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
707747740
insult.
1993499944

-1923438341
"What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
-1290732565

-1923438341
"I was reading."
1646172805

-1923438341
"Show the book."
1474222574

-1923438341
I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
-185800708

-1923438341
"You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says;
1962601205
you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not
873936706
to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we
960283101
do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to
-818238057
rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me,
-808966780
or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
-419080441
the mirror and the windows."
-228835089

-1923438341
I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
-146712105
lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
1518424811
started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
1000500644
was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
-794855303
cutting it.  The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
-423752457
climax; other feelings succeeded.
1632534089

-1923438341
"Wicked and cruel boy!" I said.  "You are like a murderer--you are like a
-2095407240
slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!"
2049237798

-1923438341
I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
-2002992723
Nero, Caligula, &c.  Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never
390745279
thought thus to have declared aloud.
1707626514

-1923438341
"What! what!" he cried.  "Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her,
-339068462
Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--"
1580527663

-1923438341
He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
-1022698913
closed with a desperate thing.  I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer.
1922563525
I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
665513114
sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time
-300785480
predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort.  I don't very
-1329159428
well know what I did with my hands, but he called me "Rat!  Rat!" and
-1300862320
bellowed out aloud.  Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
1816354206
Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed
-239751789
by Bessie and her maid Abbot.  We were parted: I heard the words--
163045581

-1923438341
"Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!"
-643051485

-1923438341
"Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
1928789769

-1923438341
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
-1240353927

-1923438341
"Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there."  Four hands were
-1333271715
immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
433360253

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER II
-684697917

-1923438341

-1923438341
I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
-1229207398
greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed
350746996
to entertain of me.  The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather
1842201344
_out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's
-828083537
mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any
671873924
other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
-864249474

-1923438341
"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
-2000156962

-1923438341
"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid.  "What shocking conduct,
-115802676
Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your
-584224381
young master."
-1423090565

-1923438341
"Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?"
264071577

-1923438341
"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
1713177566
There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
1140634424

-1923438341
They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
1917419672
and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
-1544419291
spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
631593894

-1923438341
"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie.  "Miss
813101688
Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
245593061

-1923438341
Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.  This
-1592172835
preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
-112079482
little of the excitement out of me.
1775912137

-1923438341
"Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
721675308

-1923438341
In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
1772897436

-1923438341
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
1053115321
really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
-1791245908
stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
-1508243467
incredulous of my sanity.
-554477288

-1923438341
"She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
733259103

-1923438341
"But it was always in her," was the reply.  "I've told Missis often my
-64814100
opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand
1110790482
little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
-1441851583

-1923438341
Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said--"You ought to
2093476520
be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps
1224282858
you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse."
-1838479978

-1923438341
I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
-112708895
first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.  This
-11518728
reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
-1775704570
painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.  Miss Abbot joined in--
-153544625

-1923438341
"And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed
997696497
and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with
1842505863
them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it
-2007715151
is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to
153884345
them."
-1234193307

-1923438341
"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
33108866
"you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have
254103582
a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you
-1216682608
away, I am sure."
-96274539

-1923438341
"Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
432612674
dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come,
-906954139
Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say
-1428119942
your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
-410514706
repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
749268870
fetch you away."
1522822835

-1923438341
They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
-999219636

-1923438341
The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
2118149814
never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall
1236614885
rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
-1933805461
contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
102952178
mansion.  A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
730511810
curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
-1292452855
the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
-1492478677
shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
-1679343810
the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
-1742691349
walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
-746676431
the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.  Out
-706426784
of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-
-261502786
up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles
482225357
counterpane.  Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair
922800272
near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and
1666129252
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
-680164199

-1923438341
This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because
233363581
remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be
95863367
so seldom entered.  The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe
2099597909
from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed
-36145586
herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain
-1394750404
secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her
1900669013
jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last
-1642469417
words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely
-1432083023
in spite of its grandeur.
-1649778053

-1923438341
Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his
-218463292
last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
-2081154198
undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had
-708933477
guarded it from frequent intrusion.
-339435327

-1923438341
My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
1894717939
was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me;
197852882
to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken
-742923265
reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled
1203336832
windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty
-303476499
of the bed and room.  I was not quite sure whether they had locked the
1277907905
door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.  Alas! yes: no
-2050575015
jail was ever more secure.  Returning, I had to cross before the looking-
-1241722180
glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
1691946701
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality:
-434034265
and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and
891785046
arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all
1975828510
else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of
1902114779
the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories
-21319144
represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing
-2064071079
before the eyes of belated travellers.  I returned to my stool.
-738384954

-1923438341
Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for
-1640654875
complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave
1785907099
was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush
-324270044
of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
1373852669

-1923438341
All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
-76990391
all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my
-1165211013
disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.  Why was I always
99084511
suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned?  Why
2094598812
could I never please?  Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour?
-1749324502
Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.  Georgiana, who had
820158626
a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,
1639354082
was universally indulged.  Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls,
-890011864
seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase
1637380139
indemnity for every fault.  John no one thwarted, much less punished;
-1308842274
though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,
-2051688803
set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit,
-1137885583
and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called
1010985564
his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin,
-1198270316
similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore
1153766340
and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still "her own darling."  I dared
1866063644
commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty
1701246303
and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to
1663480260
night.
-401926569

-1923438341
My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
134126831
one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned
-2086524838
against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with
-1358132671
general opprobrium.
-1213116172

-1923438341
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
1786587911
precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
-983637514
instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
-482344858
oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
2128207595
eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
-1480577710

-1923438341
What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon!  How all my
-2068664430
brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!  Yet in what
-1216904777
darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought!  I could
-378411931
not answer the ceaseless inward question--_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
2002032612
the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
-1585696884

-1923438341
I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing
1924812198
in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen vassalage.  If
-1450671679
they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.  They were not
1918811850
bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one
-1205195759
amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in
346203587
capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their
-391672470
interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the
1223847263
germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.  I
1712021187
know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome,
446812715
romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--Mrs. Reed would
759099630
have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have
-1967449141
entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants
-1003657426
would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
-1445630862

-1923438341
Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the
-995746417
beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.  I heard the rain
-287990413
still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling
-1353863803
in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then
-1535362476
my courage sank.  My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn
1195677795
depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire.  All said I was
1650141854
wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just
-982989828
conceiving of starving myself to death?  That certainly was a crime: and
-998514933
was I fit to die?  Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church
1420514179
an inviting bourne?  In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie
1322279278
buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with
1867173536
gathering dread.  I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own
-1063739063
uncle--my mother's brother--that he had taken me when a parentless infant
1015748501
to his house; and that in his last moments he had required a promise of
888588380
Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
1699781887
Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had,
1099096664
I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she
-469204041
really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her,
-1887148758
after her husband's death, by any tie?  It must have been most irksome to
-807971765
find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a
-578783192
parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial
1386447860
alien permanently intruded on her own family group.
1834795887

-1923438341
A singular notion dawned upon me.  I doubted not--never doubted--that if
-965202264
Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
-1247042456
sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also
-572560155
turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to
1852267200
recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
-1195855590
violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
-781572404
perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
948547140
harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
453725347
abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
1915813959
departed--and rise before me in this chamber.  I wiped my tears and
-1871481035
hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
-717612923
preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
1226929311
face, bending over me with strange pity.  This idea, consolatory in
432237053
theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
917297812
endeavoured to stifle it--I endeavoured to be firm.  Shaking my hair from
-1984260816
my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
-1693533349
at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.  Was it, I asked myself, a
1909551963
ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?  No; moonlight
878961437
was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
1366020601
and quivered over my head.  I can now conjecture readily that this streak
101936649
of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some
-720979832
one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken
-262208199
as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a
696211866
herald of some coming vision from another world.  My heart beat thick, my
1698173756
head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of
-867209782
wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance
-1623116079
broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
1428505631
Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and
-87223891
Abbot entered.
-1097891248

-1923438341
"Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
276273400

-1923438341
"What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
-444935500

-1923438341
"Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
-897651590

-1923438341
"What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?" again demanded
-1102653227
Bessie.
-631814096

-1923438341
"Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come."  I had now got
1523175627
hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
184527116

-1923438341
"She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.  "And
-130094417
what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it,
1929879298
but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks."
-729164341

-1923438341
"What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
966640611
came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily.
557815426
"Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left
-1047202269
in the red-room till I came to her myself."
-842391717

-1923438341
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
-564281426

-1923438341
"Let her go," was the only answer.  "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
816075143
cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor
54399190
artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks
1391127300
will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on
128881301
condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you
1529805271
then."
-1677257850

-1923438341
"O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished
-1137119494
some other way!  I shall be killed if--"
-1653362457

-1923438341
"Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
-1452834192
felt it.  I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on
1192650381
me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
731123948
duplicity.
1145332036

-1923438341
Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic
356283456
anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without
1120832269
farther parley.  I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone,
-1591402052
I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.
187143364

-1923438341
CHAPTER III
-365819000

-1923438341

-1923438341
The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a
-1218472399
frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed
1663545058
with thick black bars.  I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow
1304984937
sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
813927183
uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
-234432873
faculties.  Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
-839825548
lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
-2118475105
tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.  I rested my head
-376835218
against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
-951076599

-1923438341
In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
365654362
well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
-1781351812
fire.  It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-
1783477814
foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my
-1641066305
pillow, leaning over me.
1003053449

-1923438341
I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
689790326
security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
1259882681
individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
-1156545933
Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
352345676
than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
1089531777
face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
95564361
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
1510010950
herself and the children she employed a physician.
536397227

-1923438341
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
-1075668319

-1923438341
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it,
1636346604
smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."  Then he laid me
-1862810439
down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was
24643984
not disturbed during the night.  Having given some further directions,
-1742547733
and intimates that he should call again the next day, he departed; to my
807825373
grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near
-1832283346
my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and
685475704
my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
162892998

-1923438341
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather softly.
-1222928280

-1923438341
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
-461503018
rough.  "I will try."
2135653420

-1923438341
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
985038043

-1923438341
"No, thank you, Bessie."
-1078214047

-1923438341
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
1557575902
may call me if you want anything in the night."
-1376722838

-1923438341
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
-1606778928

-1923438341
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
385410196

-1923438341
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better
-747636991
soon, no doubt."
205256701

-1923438341
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I heard her
-212862139
say--
-946685262

-1923438341
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
-1384684417
alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
1952397634
thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was
406780144
rather too hard."
-1119613605

-1923438341
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
74247946
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps of
1860660158
their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
-1231946693
the main subject discussed.
785232391

-1923438341
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"--"A great
-804220302
black dog behind him"--"Three loud raps on the chamber door"--"A light in
-1873161860
the churchyard just over his grave," &c. &c.
2103872352

-1923438341
At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
-1322372403
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by
-1760503304
dread: such dread as children only can feel.
1918042989

-1923438341
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-
-1418203439
room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to
1677891366
this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental
-1472864866
suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did:
352482652
while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my
1283589937
bad propensities.
-2009423657

-1923438341
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
1437950302
the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse
-71074338
ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which
1114179242
kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop
126558141
from my cheek than another followed.  Yet, I thought, I ought to have
1605260711
been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in
-1737102114
the carriage with their mama.  Abbot, too, was sewing in another room,
1735455653
and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and
-1367482805
arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted
192672026
kindness.  This state of things should have been to me a paradise of
-1032848569
peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless
1043221291
fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
1456838587
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
-137072167

-1923438341
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart
-868526933
on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
2098678801
nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in
-1899567398
me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often
675406216
petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more
1796002389
closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
-1867078461
privilege.  This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
-1173820972
cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain
-903502147
favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
792569305
for, too late!  I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
-199084872
the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
-1134229932
tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as
420500828
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from
1009009756
the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I
-1494260198
considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
2028974919
interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
1300147633
having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
24291285
mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
-1694787518
length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
-1608807733
England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
1786731824
and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in
-2020311083
my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might
-1213383412
one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields,
829579856
houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds
-1742205108
of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
-1693211137
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.  Yet, when
486226950
this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its
-986992334
leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now,
922263292
never failed to find--all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt
340051747
goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most
1663305952
desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.  I closed the
2123542115
book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the
-1667424506
untasted tart.
-1231604696

-1923438341
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
1373208817
her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of
510547279
silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
855709115
Meantime she sang: her song was--
1528022958

-1923438341
   "In the days when we went gipsying,
1389363386
      A long time ago."
406309232

-1923438341
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
1408259429
Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.  But now, though her
1935964855
voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
1805471867
Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very
1611130251
lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence of a
-1578054797
funeral hymn.  She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful
-669286788
one.
-310421004

-1923438341
   "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
288289070
      Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
-511772031
   Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
704473322
      Over the path of the poor orphan child.
1402213210

-1923438341
   Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
-221208015
      Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
933159586
   Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
-877995938
      Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
492786556

-1923438341
   Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
-169472946
      Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
-832052915
   God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
-1311177757
      Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
-1197828467

-1923438341
   Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
1724033385
      Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
512635464
   Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
1139074102
      Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
-1949987534

-1923438341
   There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
-807748876
      Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
-1691146279
   Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
-135427798
      God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
-1619724918

-1923438341
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She might as
-505695831
well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
318641052
morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the course of the morning Mr.
-121975444
Lloyd came again.
344570639

-1923438341
"What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well, nurse,
1202858479
how is she?"
-1671516953

-1923438341
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
164716842

-1923438341
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name
-1988517239
is Jane, is it not?"
-203316264

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
1500633462

-1923438341
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about?
-259459155
Have you any pain?"
1070158283

-1923438341
"No, sir."
1637178386

-1923438341
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in
973013245
the carriage," interposed Bessie.
-1519331841

-1923438341
"Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
-918410236

-1923438341
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I
-166476245
answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
-1216436460
going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable."
1224646737

-1923438341
"Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
-217380519

-1923438341
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing before
1075140157
him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey;
2010029649
not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a
-93586917
hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.  Having considered me at
-2124345236
leisure, he said--
-1156163577

-1923438341
"What made you ill yesterday?"
1050985288

-1923438341
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
1534171974

-1923438341
"Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her
-1800470136
age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
1061320778

-1923438341
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
1771614441
another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I added;
-108633514
while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
-512317721

-1923438341
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for
-186541034
the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you, nurse," said
1665354852
he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back."
194023348

-1923438341
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
-929637623
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
1032237031

-1923438341
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
1636097249
Bessie was gone.
-1740333808

-1923438341
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
885246155

-1923438341
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
-1725518162

-1923438341
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
-1297135710

-1923438341
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there.
482437768
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can
1639952613
help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel
837583956
that I think I shall never forget it."
-1655740934

-1923438341
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in
1197946478
daylight?"
-1955491867

-1923438341
"No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am
541920889
unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things."
1488172537

-1923438341
"What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?"
-308979315

-1923438341
How much I wished to reply fully to this question!  How difficult it was
-553041775
to frame any answer!  Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
1270502263
feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know
-619802174
not how to express the result of the process in words.  Fearful, however,
-509910453
of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by
712432633
imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,
1775649924
though, as far as it went, true response.
-1319268747

-1923438341
"For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
-1968094788

-1923438341
"You have a kind aunt and cousins."
-1899533162

-1923438341
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
2056534511

-1923438341
"But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room."
-989701718

-1923438341
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
-326541568

-1923438341
"Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he.  "Are
1916668712
you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
1420054313

-1923438341
"It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
515474958
than a servant."
1575584057

-1923438341
"Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?"
125672929

-1923438341
"If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
-1712769766
never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
-1565204725

-1923438341
"Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
1677052624

-1923438341
"I think not, sir."
923629984

-1923438341
"None belonging to your father?"
1209928398

-1923438341
"I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
553118543
have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
336532907
them."
-1234193307

-1923438341
"If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
-1288439491

-1923438341
I reflected.  Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
2021645478
children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
1878144929
poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
1909717687
scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
500828887
for me was synonymous with degradation.
1235172244

-1923438341
"No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
-871522000

-1923438341
"Not even if they were kind to you?"
639496369

-1923438341
I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
755096143
kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be
64117392
uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing
-106826862
their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the
947758507
village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at
-1255023713
the price of caste.
692214800

-1923438341
"But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?"
990938752

-1923438341
"I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
1193706572
set: I should not like to go a begging."
1613998073

-1923438341
"Would you like to go to school?"
1148357288

-1923438341
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
-1517128282
spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
-1149841473
backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John
-1459600518
Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's tastes were
1540772463
no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline (gathered
2110223473
from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to
60942365
Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain
2100446625
accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought,
-1037857453
equally attractive.  She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and
-689823515
flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could
-162336167
play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate;
-1207495338
till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.  Besides, school
1636956453
would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire
709534159
separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
-697850309

-1923438341
"I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of my
-1110204563
musings.
1291115759

-1923438341
"Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
-667979688
"The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking to
528918228
himself; "nerves not in a good state."
733970393

-1923438341
Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up
686632069
the gravel-walk.
-2091766380

-1923438341
"Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd.  "I should like to speak
-1077583296
to her before I go."
-646437354

-1923438341
Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out.
1450073461
In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I presume,
-24784396
from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my
-1363376897
being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough
718176125
adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when
193503019
both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as
253385090
they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid
2128492819
of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she
-1830235760
were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand."  Abbot, I think,
1201774066
gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
-784160695

-1923438341
On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
-1261604448
communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that
-1642635293
my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
1848152834
considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
1907535060
irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
-1740011353
after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the
-1728038094
typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town
84582770
where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent:
-1244835869
that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month
-1678574644
of each other.
555197504

-1923438341
Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
1470571218
is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
350411791

-1923438341
"Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
1673334822
compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
379235140
little toad as that."
782700350

-1923438341
"Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
329755139
like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
-1552239138

-1923438341
"Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot.  "Little
-241173429
darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
-1753524467
as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
217120634
rabbit for supper."
-319549890

-1923438341
"So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down."  They went.
-2116882003

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER IV
434691666

-1923438341

-1923438341
From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference
-548404560
between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a
-376695046
motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and
-707948320
waited it in silence.  It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had
-1841300638
regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the
-2106243852
subject over which I brooded.  Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a
-1490535514
severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a
-1568676598
more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children;
1538030229
appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take
315033466
my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins
933253713
were constantly in the drawing-room.  Not a hint, however, did she drop
-1813439661
about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that
1954466012
she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her
-370186048
glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable
-2058800241
and rooted aversion.
1359469446

-1923438341
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as
-1573444009
little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw
-379475484
me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against
-1978310907
him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which
-1354106677
had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran
553684096
from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.  I had
1188635070
indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles
-286718882
could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I
-1250871551
had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he
-792797481
was already with his mama.  I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the
-1822754923
tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had flown at him like a mad cat: he
-1474622717
was stopped rather harshly--
-1178669616

-1923438341
"Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is
892556137
not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters
1013564173
should associate with her."
-914386712

-1923438341
Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all
2070470268
deliberating on my words--
-602821037

-1923438341
"They are not fit to associate with me."
1359534622

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
-759102821
audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
1307109096
whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib,
-205980192
dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one
-215954435
syllable during the remainder of the day.
1892361318

-1923438341
"What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
-1838231272
voluntary demand.  I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
1219089846
tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
583576471
something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
593059738

-1923438341
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
-443557010
eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm,
651953209
and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or
-4731348
fiend.  I was now in for it.
2006331345

-1923438341
"My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can
-170984226
papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you
-236685092
wish me dead."
-426051167

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed
-1968526281
both my ears, and then left me without a word.  Bessie supplied the
93289171
hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a
-1242839082
doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a
-1482455967
roof.  I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging
-904832159
in my breast.
-208504418

-1923438341
November, December, and half of January passed away.  Christmas and the
1679551496
New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
1871612231
presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.  From
1090331177
every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
1419341042
consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and
-265821872
seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
442195730
frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
-391325301
afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
-1496664470
below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
1031700667
jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
-702603882
hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.  When
-2035715596
tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
833879066
solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
-2114827
miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
469579013
for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind
-1677088815
and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings
1164710423
quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of
-1135641058
Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.  But Bessie, as soon
2004012275
as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the
-1664225667
lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing
-1930070496
the candle along with her.  I then sat with my doll on my knee till the
1677120782
fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse
568073724
than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull
-275967202
red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might,
1477891147
and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.  To this crib I
-1395584916
always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth
859844045
of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in
-1313725261
loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature
2138507843
scarecrow.  It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I
-1156484065
doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of
-1831535595
sensation.  I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and
-499031371
when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it
-1929575063
to be happy likewise.
1041044054

-1923438341
Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and
-2062568240
listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she
1235262827
would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or
200388751
perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a
1449304998
cheese-cake--then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had
-1684370140
finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed me,
-1723616333
and said, "Good night, Miss Jane."  When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me
1949598763
the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most
-317374362
intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never
1519122326
push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often
313816875
wont to do.  Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural
-2026672905
capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of
-605084292
narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her
1524900017
nursery tales.  She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and
760582338
person are correct.  I remember her as a slim young woman, with black
-2143671341
hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she
-1514669455
had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or
865395954
justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at
-1782314321
Gateshead Hall.
-1316982966

-1923438341
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
-343991040
Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
-980523476
to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go
1161020329
and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less
642847846
so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she
-1237874898
thus obtained.  She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for
-2141818293
saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in
-1774976120
driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and
-1525185463
slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of
-210908594
his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and
540794292
Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a
-1358433279
handsome profit thereby.  As to her money, she first secreted it in odd
1676063617
corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards
-1288451199
having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing
1832570169
her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious
-998304335
rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted
-1613361026
every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious
797525667
accuracy.
-1126852251

-1923438341
Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
391823719
interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
926525280
which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic.  I was making my
2123743458
bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before
1679009077
she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-
-110111788
nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.).  Having spread the
-932254149
quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in
-1084011504
order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an
-1350804012
abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny
1881482947
chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped
1243366026
my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to
2054067919
breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and
-1821816851
thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the
-1764465554
grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard
870458336
frost.
895514664

-1923438341
From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
-1532588370
and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
2128245559
the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
-2116091566
carriage roll through.  I watched it ascending the drive with
-878471575
indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
1796042004
visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the
-554912331
door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.  All this being
151131245
nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the
-450970147
spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs
809341795
of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
532850176
The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and
723778341
having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out
-1776875166
the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the
-1152918446
nursery.
606387880

-1923438341
"Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you
36845292
washed your hands and face this morning?"  I gave another tug before I
1383738277
answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
342173409
yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
-1709512736
cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
601641360

-1923438341
"No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
124169548

-1923438341
"Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite
194899155
red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the
2059224564
window for?"
1654656292

-1923438341
I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
768939077
hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
-1497797296
inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with
1566043223
soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly
-233871013
brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the
535317857
stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
1405541149

-1923438341
I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was
561028976
there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon
-108801074
me.  I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been
-784471495
called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
1918039296
breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on
230274573
which it dismayed me to intrude.
988547928

-1923438341
I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and
-1242419233
I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon
1885736863
had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I
-389018086
feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;
1137031953
ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the
447437120
breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
-1264026104

-1923438341
"Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
335434011
stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  "What
35903333
should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?"  The
50861270
handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,
2115097278
I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first
1039240502
sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:
-2018230641
the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft
522848935
by way of capital.
-1227617368

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
-627485133
me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
-1807626175
with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
-821227033
you."
-1027683220

-1923438341
_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and
334111039
having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
-1609202123
twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice,
-1578093027
"Her size is small: what is her age?"
1305570039

-1923438341
"Ten years."
1129655735

-1923438341
"So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
2130602780
some minutes.  Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
-589082973

-1923438341
"Jane Eyre, sir."
-862432347

-1923438341
In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
639460617
but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the
-1040637875
lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
1865458821

-1923438341
"Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
-774289777

-1923438341
Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
-738684697
contrary opinion: I was silent.  Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
959585938
expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that
1813186863
subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
557158016

-1923438341
"Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
-1195172099
from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair opposite
1084988042
Mrs. Reed's.  "Come here," he said.
-38604255

-1923438341
I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
-1027668801
What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
1075401309
great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
1996432939

-1923438341
"No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
954345363
naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
1212973070

-1923438341
"They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
-1778230087

-1923438341
"And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?"
714641654

-1923438341
"A pit full of fire."
1325102813

-1923438341
"And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
-1147314893
ever?"
-872665100

-1923438341
"No, sir."
1637178386

-1923438341
"What must you do to avoid it?"
-1938461291

-1923438341
I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
1633136504
"I must keep in good health, and not die."
-1898555373

-1923438341
"How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I
305870370
buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good
-1341191332
little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same
164435618
could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
1851126515

-1923438341
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on
245912487
the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far
-1065439717
enough away.
-448107668

-1923438341
"I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
526864085
been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
1935511430

-1923438341
"Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
-1627320350
my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
-1682726946

-1923438341
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
-2112427453

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Do you read your Bible?"
-2046938804

-1923438341
"Sometimes."
-414451139

-1923438341
"With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?"
440516740

-1923438341
"I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and
-1105191874
a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job
-1582383728
and Jonah."
486669486

-1923438341
"And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?"
-877219522

-1923438341
"No, sir."
1637178386

-1923438341
"No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
202233826
Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
922000088
gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the
1034564638
verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little
-2107150767
angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant
1203943009
piety."
509527950

-1923438341
"Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
-1808483551

-1923438341
"That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change
-635199079
it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and
-455518118
give you a heart of flesh."
-1911652302

-1923438341
I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
1291317134
operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
-1649483537
interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
-839262467
conversation herself.
2030371144

-1923438341
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
-602547205
you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
-1898083830
and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I
1002045529
should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep
-1464113552
a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a
205085919
tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may
-337966948
not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
-1572739681

-1923438341
Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her nature
-208695501
to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully
-504694721
I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my efforts were
-403061934
still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.  Now, uttered
-359921047
before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived
-1281110231
that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence
92669937
which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed
1060397763
the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future
-1347200989
path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an
194574855
artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
-133051035

-1923438341
"Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
-1275030557
hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
1321551416

-1923438341
"Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
-1288817546
is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
236401078
burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
282132027
Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
108769140

-1923438341
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
-438339986
continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for
-1398153441
the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
-83356176
Lowood."
1282928744

-1923438341
"Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
365648501
Brocklehurst.  "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
1276623441
appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
-1774942858
care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied
948547107
how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the
1946279241
other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter,
-1565483845
Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she
-1270122439
exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood
-1123497001
look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores,
-601690177
and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost
861682662
like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and
-339786791
mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'"
1269021516

-1923438341
"This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had I
304239978
sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
-1024122041
exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr.
-1270303439
Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
326300966

-1923438341
"Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
-858303851
observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood:
-1415142080
plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and
-2110716977
active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its
-291946879
inhabitants."
1049144348

-1923438341
"Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a
-352859215
pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position
-6664178
and prospects?"
-2018408061

-1923438341
"Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
597272849
and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege
-2078216675
of her election."
1188009635

-1923438341
"I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
1758681561
assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
-793314537
becoming too irksome."
-466808596

-1923438341
"No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall
-336979022
return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
-1531628804
friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall
-1153210820
send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
1243477696
will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye."
1185679267

-1923438341
"Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
-1911067571
and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
1541312916

-1923438341
"I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
1806201046
Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account
-1648330864
of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to
1774226251
falsehood and deceit.'"
409004866

-1923438341
With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
277132261
in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
1078235671

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was
-187081279
sewing, I was watching her.  Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or
1128228506
seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and
-828627630
strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat
-1486878210
large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow
-730030852
was low, her chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently
685353651
regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her
-2116960172
skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was
23241369
sound as a bell--illness never came near her; she was an exact, clever
633033000
manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control;
-284688469
her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn;
-1089953060
she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off
-1293191359
handsome attire.
1870170552

-1923438341
Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
-1399987611
figure; I perused her features.  In my hand I held the tract containing
-197252368
the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
1324763971
pointed as to an appropriate warning.  What had just passed; what Mrs.
-1500634035
Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their
1619940021
conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every
-857732849
word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment
-1431202485
fomented now within me.
-1169964817

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
1268678159
at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
1770052442

-1923438341
"Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate.  My look or
-520944471
something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
262564655
extreme though suppressed irritation.  I got up, I went to the door; I
1047730523
came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
-298575023
to her.
1491831094

-1923438341
_Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but how?
1612292258
What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?  I gathered my
659154863
energies and launched them in this blunt sentence--
632120272

-1923438341
"I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I
-692231100
do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except
-206262777
John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl,
-1630494030
Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
770330427

-1923438341
Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
1009495189
continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
-856519355

-1923438341
"What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
1249924490
person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily
1793629971
used to a child.
1698289440

-1923438341
That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had.  Shaking from
78352553
head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
1532773115

-1923438341
"I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again
-1950289497
as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and
-119757557
if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say
-622289505
the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with
1909622345
miserable cruelty."
1528518823

-1923438341
"How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
1127360242

-1923438341
"How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You
-761079612
think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
1626806572
kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember
-1480489896
how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the
-1711120990
red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony;
183525393
though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have
-631751910
mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your
-1349352100
wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody
-1632362508
who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman,
1242604571
but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!"
328022495

-1923438341
{How dare I, Mrs. Ried?  How dare I?  Because it is the truth: p30.jpg}
-1450856310

-1923438341
Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
-23310995
the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.  It seemed as if
1513952967
an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-
653767235
for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked
-1725157848
frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her
-1306318091
hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she
-1931249986
would cry.
2134631886

-1923438341
"Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you
-982904917
tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?"
578170985

-1923438341
"No, Mrs. Reed."
-621376785

-1923438341
"Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be
-1192214856
your friend."
-214086212

-1923438341
"Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
-1320374836
disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what
-824188766
you have done."
-222011677

-1923438341
"Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for
-600230435
their faults."
2018644731

-1923438341
"Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
-2078228902

-1923438341
"But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the
-958491278
nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little."
1143418886

-1923438341
"I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
-2133594250
Reed, for I hate to live here."
-779963883

-1923438341
"I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto voce_;
-2135195145
and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
-12843466

-1923438341
I was left there alone--winner of the field.  It was the hardest battle I
-1044722561
had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
1252126597
rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
892922491
solitude.  First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
270279136
pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
-1599693964
pulses.  A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
-497410235
give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without
-1472645221
experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.  A
-90835531
ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a
963045235
meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same
-1861008909
ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have
376642167
represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's
1082954035
silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the
-157321666
dreariness of my hated and hating position.
1263341727

-1923438341
Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine
-980154552
it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and
94438075
corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.  Willingly
-1499427112
would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly
1798150380
from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her
923621680
repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse
1010682329
of my nature.
41081233

-1923438341
I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
-467427699
fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre
-531027865
indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and
1622498450
endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own
-692904317
thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
-1211722766
fascinating.  I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
-1530536558
shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
-1505520301
breeze, through the grounds.  I covered my head and arms with the skirt
1014408457
of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
-70616126
quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
461904904
falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
840759455
by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.  I leaned against a
-1571355705
gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
1642523669
the short grass was nipped and blanched.  It was a very grey day; a most
859625612
opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes felt it
-1124432962
intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
1460122340
melting.  I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and
-1752681424
over again, "What shall I do?--what shall I do?"
781803103

-1923438341
All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you?  Come
-1120234091
to lunch!"
1567716315

-1923438341
It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
1041229832
came tripping down the path.
1738127079

-1923438341
"You naughty little thing!" she said.  "Why don't you come when you are
-1298891705
called?"
362859676

-1923438341
Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
732252537
brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross.
-151734530
The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not
-2110671770
disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I _was_
-947659034
disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.  I just put my two
-938727692
arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
1971873684

-1923438341
The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
-2128121496
indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
-1483186576

-1923438341
"You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at me;
2262248
"a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
1556375267
suppose?"
1827807849

-1923438341
I nodded.
1149371179

-1923438341
"And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
594398379

-1923438341
"What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me."
1793007459

-1923438341
"Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should
525396091
be bolder."
-2554000

-1923438341
"What! to get more knocks?"
1062577876

-1923438341
"Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said,
-1997953914
when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
1044836559
of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news
191566488
for you."
420384552

-1923438341
"I don't think you have, Bessie."
-990783193

-1923438341
"Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but
-393057835
Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
145207298
afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a
-1489990370
little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I
-1537737729
am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a
2017694273
day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you."
830225570

-1923438341
"Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
903852578

-1923438341
"Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of
440154376
me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
-751667845
provoking."
-719996825

-1923438341
"I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
824728518
have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
-415716415
dread."
-1922701699

-1923438341
"If you dread them they'll dislike you."
1100463213

-1923438341
"As you do, Bessie?"
-167200079

-1923438341
"I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the
1277794493
others."
-1333737178

-1923438341
"You don't show it."
-1176557993

-1923438341
"You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What
-1502363722
makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
68703803

-1923438341
"Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"--I was going to say
1331257073
something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
-691187735
thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
239145690

-1923438341
"And so you're glad to leave me?"
1995235036

-1923438341
"Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
1676633633

-1923438341
"Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say
-449071322
now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
175734015
you'd _rather_ not."
-1205031119

-1923438341
"I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down."  Bessie stooped; we
757808020
mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
133450784
That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
-1532823332
told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
1099573099
sweetest songs.  Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
671430409

-1923438341
CHAPTER V
-969298053

-1923438341

-1923438341
Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
908838026
when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
1522816542
nearly dressed.  I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
-841958508
washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
457912175
setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.  I
-715215261
was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
1152754140
at six a.m.  Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
-575164652
the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast.  Few children
79970973
can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.  Bessie,
1215833244
having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and
-1832725024
bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and
462683986
put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet,
1755013908
and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.  As we
-1562402107
passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in and bid Missis good-
415721532
bye?"
841906267

-1923438341
"No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
-1669068474
supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
-1565403840
either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
1675688016
friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
612072344

-1923438341
"What did you say, Miss?"
-1283650378

-1923438341
"Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
83420532
the wall."
1277312905

-1923438341
"That was wrong, Miss Jane."
-366061451

-1923438341
"It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has
1677221689
been my foe."
-1025881596

-1923438341
"O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
1841793791

-1923438341
"Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and went
-1183772953
out at the front door.
304977232

-1923438341
The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
623364905
light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.  Raw
797219691
and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
-2136918880
the drive.  There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
1588628223
we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
-1275623621
been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.  It
2008130478
wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck,
-504675463
the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door
278603989
and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
-1371126778

-1923438341
"Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
1636819908

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"And how far is it?"
-2117198902

-1923438341
"Fifty miles."
949750242

-1923438341
"What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
-1302006866
alone."
1979175716

-1923438341
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its
-309409924
top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my
1653865688
trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung
-81959552
with kisses.
-949139334

-1923438341
"Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he lifted
-749949739
me into the inside.
-816498388

-1923438341
"Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed "All
-1289595555
right," and on we drove.  Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead;
1905733192
thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and
-2027546424
mysterious regions.
-609920103

-1923438341
I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to
-121537589
me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
1333749480
hundreds of miles of road.  We passed through several towns, and in one,
1319237876
a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
-1154807843
passengers alighted to dine.  I was carried into an inn, where the guard
-1780511829
wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
-700852695
an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
-966691517
the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
1622549496
with musical instruments.  Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
1114645572
very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
1650488259
kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
-186399587
frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.  At last the guard
-859175549
returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted
-1208449136
his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the
1249835677
"stony street" of L-.
1030877693

-1923438341
The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
114900648
began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
-479684288
ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
1931466699
heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley,
1651425737
dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I
2143255023
heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
984211767

-1923438341
Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
1551010988
when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
2121030667
and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress
-612547430
by the light of the lamps.
-1614055939

-1923438341
"Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked.  I answered
-670343175
"Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
1989825865
instantly drove away.
1903073264

-1923438341
I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
-1622777644
of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.  Rain, wind, and
502515131
darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me
225044099
and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she
1593476161
shut and locked it behind her.  There was now visible a house or
108086876
houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights
1362591801
burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were
-1600494566
admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room
-384976011
with a fire, where she left me alone.
987037585

-1923438341
I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round;
-1992286344
there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by
-546916270
intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture:
1361729961
it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at
-111121520
Gateshead, but comfortable enough.  I was puzzling to make out the
-2139962978
subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual
1625464964
carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
-520033707

-1923438341
The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large
1444359811
forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was
-1241114030
grave, her bearing erect.
-1094423503

-1923438341
"The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her candle
300724771
down on the table.  She considered me attentively for a minute or two,
-1028059623
then further added--
-1896856810

-1923438341
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she
-1437246094
asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
-1608573921

-1923438341
"A little, ma'am."
-772966746

-1923438341
"And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
748805671
bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to
-798804426
come to school, my little girl?"
1377821984

-1923438341
I explained to her that I had no parents.  She inquired how long they had
-1921224897
been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read,
-1195987595
write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her
-1521920408
forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child," dismissed
-223770192
me along with Miss Miller.
-927823377

-1923438341
The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me
-1397710419
appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look,
-577861371
and air.  Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a
946854482
careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always
735340886
a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards
826646704
found she really was, an under-teacher.  Led by her, I passed from
1852304526
compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and
-895366364
irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary
-1842250022
silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came
-191587851
upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room,
-565324697
with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of
-510149071
candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of
-510761219
every age, from nine or ten to twenty.  Seen by the dim light of the
-1852573133
dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality
-2101086934
exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of
60962540
quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.  It was the hour of study;
274332840
they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I
1209996018
had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
955270051

-1923438341
Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up
-1505178205
to the top of the long room she cried out--
-1915784425

-1923438341
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
-161188205

-1923438341
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
718751711
the books and removed them.  Miss Miller again gave the word of command--
80345491

-1923438341
"Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
-838720073

-1923438341
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with
69651497
portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher
483734176
of water and mug in the middle of each tray.  The portions were handed
-970932203
round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common
-1237876925
to all.  When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not
1728743547
touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating:
876770494
I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
792953343

-1923438341
The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
762032884
off, two and two, upstairs.  Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
1073364515
scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like
-1513073541
the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.  To-night I was to be Miss
2088539572
Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
672888782
at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
1912094327
occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
-744806605
silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
-368174943

-1923438341
The night passed rapidly.  I was too tired even to dream; I only once
801577250
awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
-819204940
torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
1009157732
side.  When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
-2029637379
were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
1870112526
two burned in the room.  I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
-1503831160
I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
755407856
basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to
-307903965
six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.  Again the bell
1108470392
rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
1900262348
stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
-1363786736
read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
2067672921

-1923438341
"Form classes!"
583541423

-1923438341
A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
-1186196285
repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!"  When it subsided, I saw
522887414
them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the
224076733
four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a
-233188107
Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.  A pause of some
-22476324
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
1675237685
Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
579011253

-1923438341
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
1536230289
walked to a table and took her seat.  Miss Miller assumed the fourth
-937220376
vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
-1026082860
smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
-1467906411
called, and placed at the bottom of it.
-1774489034

-1923438341
Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of
-1266925423
Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
-82260066
chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.  By the time that exercise
-756717057
was terminated, day had fully dawned.  The indefatigable bell now sounded
1379169337
for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another
-835371994
room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting
-583183151
something to eat!  I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so
228033480
little the day before.
229376522

-1923438341
The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
296027103
smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth
-152590426
an odour far from inviting.  I saw a universal manifestation of
-595015282
discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
829605839
destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of
2143928913
the first class, rose the whispered words--
-88040486

-1923438341
"Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!"
946034529

-1923438341
"Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
-579608961
upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
664683719
somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
-1132316037
while a more buxom lady presided at the other.  I looked in vain for her
1125079454
I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
-1736870500
occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
-2089027263
foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found,
-2051446160
took the corresponding seat at the other board.  A long grace was said
-239030138
and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and
1873279579
the meal began.
-220637280

-1923438341
Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion
-1423136788
without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I
441411609
perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as
1372972602
bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.  The spoons
-1213558516
were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swallow it;
-502050109
but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.  Breakfast was over,
-1403108437
and none had breakfasted.  Thanks being returned for what we had not got,
-459379685
and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the
-293261664
schoolroom.  I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables,
-334492010
I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked
1350255148
at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of
992444771
them, the stout one, whispered--
-162407380

-1923438341
"Abominable stuff!  How shameful!"
-1621955357

-1923438341
A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the
-1384141421
schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to
232779415
be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
1321479590
The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused
726351581
roundly.  Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.  Miss Miller
1389464180
was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing
-249033002
about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures.  I heard the name of
1659813417
Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her
-1892408974
head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to check the general
-1929597845
wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
-1919456887

-1923438341
A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
-1944480234
standing in the middle of the room, cried--
1711771390

-1923438341
"Silence!  To your seats!"
159813180

-1923438341
Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
-553976473
into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
1463948107
The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all
1981734904
seemed to wait.  Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty
-764628549
girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all
-2125167158
with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown
1606559688
dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat,
-388042819
with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander's
-1549421339
purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose
-1502517485
of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made
-16087742
shoes, fastened with brass buckles.  Above twenty of those clad in this
-1012834120
costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill,
114775091
and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
1086969489

-1923438341
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
-347724626
teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
-1922287342
little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and
1445870767
grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten,
-1846624839
and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole
-179772452
school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
-791309354

-1923438341
What was the matter?  I had heard no order given: I was puzzled.  Ere I
477827788
had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were
-273507906
now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
-671066121
encountered the personage who had received me last night.  She stood at
1532522766
the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each
2128317021
end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.  Miss
920195906
Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her
-328952806
answer, went back to her place, and said aloud--
-1406878242

-1923438341
"Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
-1801408510

-1923438341
While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
-1663101721
up the room.  I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
-634294715
retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps.
-209022863
Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown
-353850986
eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long
1280884410
lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her
-717587960
temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls,
747877678
according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor
-1493518628
long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was
-1720708289
of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;
-340939107
a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her
-1050355889
girdle.  Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a
1671779497
complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will
-396186261
have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the
-1926905433
exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name
-992553965
written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
-1380980769

-1923438341
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
-822062572
seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
1141207727
first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
-1944878182
lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
-945512908
grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and
21679199
music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.  The
-1864022953
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck
-349265549
twelve.  The superintendent rose--
-2007569161

-1923438341
"I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
1520009211

-1923438341
The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
1267801948
sank at her voice.  She went on--
1447441907

-1923438341
"You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
-1799672613
hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
-1701699974
to all."
1617886131

-1923438341
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
1308697527

-1923438341
"It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
1699922194
tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
-1051523031

-1923438341
The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
-1016420034
high delight and refreshment of the whole school.  The order was now
-1845211724
given "To the garden!"  Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
782485946
of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.  I was similarly
-1643200570
equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
1439121207

-1923438341
The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
1448136067
exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side,
-1874814076
and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little
-744971714
beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate,
-95300562
and each bed had an owner.  When full of flowers they would doubtless
-1589390647
look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight
-1973488683
and brown decay.  I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an
-381886795
inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by
-378231475
a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the
-628639579
floods of yesterday.  The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged
1925510855
in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for
-1519714284
shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist
500767445
penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a
954309589
hollow cough.
709752961

-1923438341
As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me;
-2092996138
I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed;
2136387853
it did not oppress me much.  I leant against a pillar of the verandah,
275028985
drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which
1820800959
nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within,
1325408442
delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.  My
938072616
reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly
518106032
yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to
-1905861182
an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the
-1563231883
future I could form no conjecture.  I looked round the convent-like
1914337278
garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed
-733926509
grey and old, the other half quite new.  The new part, containing the
-1303980716
schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows,
-1288880435
which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore
724474417
this inscription:--
-742214576

-1923438341
"Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi
-266350029
Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county."  "Let your light so
-1817616939
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
-334677625
Father which is in heaven."--St. Matt. v. 16.
727002638

-1923438341
I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
1682451735
belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.  I was
671750372
still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
-805526363
make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture,
-1168334026
when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.  I saw a
2079214901
girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the
-431375176
perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the
601319936
title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and
1881838134
consequently attractive.  In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and
850612911
I said to her directly--
-1208447501

-1923438341
"Is your book interesting?"  I had already formed the intention of asking
2138580432
her to lend it to me some day.
-1323809661

-1923438341
"I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which
642047542
she examined me.
780607182

-1923438341
"What is it about?" I continued.  I hardly know where I found the
-1274252216
hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
-302608835
contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
-1017093077
chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
914797020
frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious
-1377576933
or substantial.
1764071817

-1923438341
"You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
533505283

-1923438341
I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
-832064876
taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw
-1507683143
nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed
-971932798
spread over the closely-printed pages.  I returned it to her; she
-25234574
received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to relapse
1756805270
into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her--
-578795478

-1923438341
"Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What
1920703987
is Lowood Institution?"
-870043737

-1923438341
"This house where you are come to live."
1030210354

-1923438341
"And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from
1041770986
other schools?"
419606880

-1923438341
"It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
1661054898
charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
-1415818162
father or your mother dead?"
666299489

-1923438341
"Both died before I can remember."
450357976

-1923438341
"Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this
-2070736802
is called an institution for educating orphans."
1151038003

-1923438341
"Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?"
2024263035

-1923438341
"We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
-648285546

-1923438341
"Then why do they call us charity-children?"
1558913648

-1923438341
"Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
-1491681876
deficiency is supplied by subscription."
-496885844

-1923438341
"Who subscribes?"
357181088

-1923438341
"Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
-943776983
and in London."
-1222322763

-1923438341
"Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
1953745239

-1923438341
"The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
1274590560
and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
1255142839

-1923438341
"Why?"
-1873626783

-1923438341
"Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
1775531568

-1923438341
"Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and
425378724
who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
-1339619666

-1923438341
"To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
349427921
Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
370767675
all our clothes."
-9825172

-1923438341
"Does he live here?"
-972173998

-1923438341
"No--two miles off, at a large hall."
490339624

-1923438341
"Is he a good man?"
757091332

-1923438341
"He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
1409183080

-1923438341
"Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
-1118221821

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"And what are the other teachers called?"
-1656976228

-1923438341
"The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
-1549676136
and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
-424650245
everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches
-315931450
history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one
-1213575953
who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a
1333771713
yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and
1858811618
teaches French."
2102977297

-1923438341
"Do you like the teachers?"
1721369107

-1923438341
"Well enough."
-1577644

-1923438341
"Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot
1510590784
pronounce her name as you do."
1290077591

-1923438341
"Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame
-560849499
Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
392612019

-1923438341
"But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?"
2008491315

-1923438341
"Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because
896745814
she knows far more than they do."
-1327102904

-1923438341
"Have you been long here?"
1971011492

-1923438341
"Two years."
-1229979125

-1923438341
"Are you an orphan?"
2109109469

-1923438341
"My mother is dead."
2094050827

-1923438341
"Are you happy here?"
-127853011

-1923438341
"You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for
370681803
the present: now I want to read."
334604290

-1923438341
But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
-1394626795
house.  The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
796870048
appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
429810208
dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
-2062727391
steam redolent of rancid fat.  I found the mess to consist of indifferent
-1784918946
potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.  Of
-1486395977
this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each
1965102614
pupil.  I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every
-1793638206
day's fare would be like this.
1574796322

-1923438341
After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
-1035056672
recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
-159278099

-1923438341
The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom
1038642152
I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd
-179592603
from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large
796906050
schoolroom.  The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious,
-1431169227
especially for so great a girl--she looked thirteen or upwards.  I
-2120648417
expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my
939224374
surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood,
-1912029410
the central mark of all eyes.  "How can she bear it so quietly--so
1259011067
firmly?" I asked of myself.  "Were I in her place, it seems to me I
1807071857
should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she
-752539542
were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation:
668225486
of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is
-166224453
she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure
-633364332
they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart:
1874787899
she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really
147830091
present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty."
-1503568642

-1923438341
Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
-894483151
coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.  I devoured my bread and drank
-174017378
my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was
722462099
still hungry.  Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the
-1356433561
glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed.  Such was my
1162696251
first day at Lowood.
1371672195

-1923438341
CHAPTER VI
-807525468

-1923438341

-1923438341
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
1267893484
but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
-1308580339
washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.  A change had taken place
-1342580041
in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
-314844796
whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had
-1304754949
made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
-21250882

-1923438341
Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I
1014833238
felt ready to perish with cold.  Breakfast-time came at last, and this
259691989
morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity
793689215
small.  How small my portion seemed!  I wished it had been doubled.
-391105566

-1923438341
In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and
-1653194589
regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been
550429216
a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor
-1421158778
therein.  At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the
-145516539
lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from
2139761153
task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
1595479757
o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin
-1543384070
two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in
510803446
a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.  At
1069527619
that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still
-353632529
stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the
-856233458
subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in
479717312
which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
2090947436
commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.  It was English
-229846132
history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at
-2068522573
the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
-1123587506
class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops,
-1237932475
she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.  Even in that obscure position,
-641551503
Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant notice: she
1688531705
was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:--
-10481670

-1923438341
"Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
-1007465057
their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
1941928757
side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately."  "Burns, you poke
180045099
your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in."  "Burns, I insist on your
-1158137253
holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
-966402661
&c. &c.
-2007255306

-1923438341
A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
-1277645545
girls examined.  The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
-160660134
I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-
359575152
money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little
1701057146
difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed
-175592901
to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready
-709055086
with answers on every point.  I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would
1945928119
praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
980156007

-1923438341
"You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
-905934239
morning!"
2125738392

-1923438341
Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.  "Why," thought I, "does
-1107834781
she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face,
929642913
as the water was frozen?"
1818205003

-1923438341
My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein
1340072756
of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time,
-604613652
asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark,
481954545
stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my
1894050746
observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.  When I returned to my seat,
1698165723
that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the
-1195247076
import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small
-1547299942
inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying
-1657480422
in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.  This ominous
76887602
tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she
-723139398
quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher
-1568572197
instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the
1870897988
bunch of twigs.  Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from
-2021027850
my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment
2082884048
of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face
1757946300
altered its ordinary expression.
2041848683

-1923438341
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
839804525
your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
2052724070

-1923438341
Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
1859889755
book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her pocket,
-2017357055
and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
2042781106

-1923438341
The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
1394136020
day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five
-1853668442
o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long
-1233123928
restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in
-2000461100
the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to
1138810157
supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the
1599699939
ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave
498984236
one a welcome sense of liberty.
-1196452001

-1923438341
On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
192863800
pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing
1973992416
groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the
-2112762823
windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a
393192721
drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close
-197577587
to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the
1683042835
disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
1236186207

-1923438341
Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
-618839101
have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
-772717132
separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
365652464
chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
-1822996937
strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl
760588855
more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise
-1387450226
to clamour.
-108889744

-1923438341
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
-1841710401
the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns,
-2050109614
absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a
-2096491829
book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
1303125673

-1923438341
"Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
1459732451

-1923438341
"Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
1478849891

-1923438341
And in five minutes more she shut it up.  I was glad of this.  "Now,"
231753824
thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk."  I sat down by her on the
1516786354
floor.
-158123166

-1923438341
"What is your name besides Burns?"
-1855873032

-1923438341
"Helen."
671433694

-1923438341
"Do you come a long way from here?"
257147268

-1923438341
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
-1104816010

-1923438341
"Will you ever go back?"
787183516

-1923438341
"I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
822320063

-1923438341
"You must wish to leave Lowood?"
2101243925

-1923438341
"No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
2091262240
would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
-939084266

-1923438341
"But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
-1508041278

-1923438341
"Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
-948465022

-1923438341
"And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
-717691392
If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
1451430990
break it under her nose."
-1121044471

-1923438341
"Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
-1813072855
Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief
891762334
to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which
1675581618
nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil
1071044787
consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the
771860912
Bible bids us return good for evil."
-133415911

-1923438341
"But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in
1868096073
the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am
962710307
far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
1276159379

-1923438341
"Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
1631764572
weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
1328359052
required to bear."
-361555403

-1923438341
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
137693928
endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
-868723511
forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.  Still I felt that Helen
-1107127349
Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.  I suspected she
-2014764348
might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply;
1796943350
like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
-426358736

-1923438341
"You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very
1947342814
good."
1472207616

-1923438341
"Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd
465900320
said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am
-1874562473
careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have
-1280160575
no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected
1651022511
to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss
-1384107865
Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular."
410514493

-1923438341
"And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
466576366
addition: she kept silence.
509970745

-1923438341
"Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
1136481729

-1923438341
At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
325572772
grave face.
655394825

-1923438341
"Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
719889073
even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
1654030378
gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
54570533
liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
195127700
even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure
-1491611430
me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly,
282039609
cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
890178639

-1923438341
"That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
654163360

-1923438341
"For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this
-712979847
morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
-1092199877
to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now,
-2060068357
mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd,
1792563821
and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound
-5574156
of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in
-115021483
Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a
1252613345
little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it
-234451049
comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard
1098563265
nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no
1646496439
answer ready."
680098582

-1923438341
"Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
85367220

-1923438341
"It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
1872973121
interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
1034790733
wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
-507294065
unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it
-607379250
was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
1490821142
farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to
1702158927
look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was
1726549645
tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered
-434978842
king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right
1385884983
to shed.  How dared they kill him!"
-1785781461

-1923438341
Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well
-529824916
understand her--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she
-811597092
discussed.  I recalled her to my level.
-718863072

-1923438341
"And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
-1469249702

-1923438341
"No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to
-1751389021
say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly
-1020445489
agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what
-1785493851
I wished to gain."
-217577799

-1923438341
"Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
-556327476

-1923438341
"Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides
-230667598
me.  There is no merit in such goodness."
773886424

-1923438341
"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I
523415453
ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who
1675175697
are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way:
2085939905
they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would
773973265
grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should
1858909234
strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the
662674504
person who struck us never to do it again."
230690998

-1923438341
"You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
-1976710039
but a little untaught girl."
-1817470255

-1923438341
"But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
-2097182131
please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
-971451756
unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
1652169199
affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
-1386016879

-1923438341
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
-1136747074
civilised nations disown it."
80673271

-1923438341
"How?  I don't understand."
1753408694

-1923438341
"It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most
-3229056
certainly heals injury."
-325737746

-1923438341
"What then?"
367018745

-1923438341
"Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
-1636202426
make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
1452185085

-1923438341
"What does He say?"
-2056886049

-1923438341
"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate
394392686
you and despitefully use you."
819042346

-1923438341
"Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son
866172054
John, which is impossible."
-919473159

-1923438341
In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
-1298329450
to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
-54057575
Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or
308631867
softening.
-1397144031

-1923438341
Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
-25339203
remark, but she said nothing.
-767364263

-1923438341
"Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
-298131112
woman?"
409710057

-1923438341
"She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your
814684955
cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you
-2009938863
remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep
1366309689
impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage
-108689023
so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you
1278134926
tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
-1408420933
excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
-1997673657
or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
1514674418
faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall
-367606844
put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and
-400425871
sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the
-351720548
spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and
1703753831
thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence
-1941968961
it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being
-1939894097
higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the
-1521549810
pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the
1890431984
contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot
1857242575
believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and
6849221
which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for
2083026781
it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a
-928026269
terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly
792193561
distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely
1027467968
forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never
-892026481
worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice
-125923012
never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
888444537

-1923438341
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
-539244899
sentence.  I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
-278221119
rather to converse with her own thoughts.  She was not allowed much time
-113476369
for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
464318590
exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent--
968839880

-1923438341
"Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
-1942227465
your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!"
161611420

-1923438341
Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
557493895
without reply as without delay.

CHAPTER VII
-74341868

-1923438341

-1923438341
My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either;
1902093155
it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself
510659393
to new rules and unwonted tasks.  The fear of failure in these points
1736529847
harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these
-1018984090
were no trifles.
-1480128999

-1923438341
During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
373163373
their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond
-890827146
the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had
2088022484
to pass an hour every day in the open air.  Our clothing was insufficient
-1196451160
to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into
-1875564752
our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered
1248270935
with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting
1408120824
irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet
-1911006160
inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes
677130410
into my shoes in the morning.  Then the scanty supply of food was
1687921657
distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely
2031945816
sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.  From this deficiency of
-1218803430
nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger
58747564
pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would
-1279523145
coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.  Many a time I have
576944211
shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread
-315599356
distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the
-1216511891
contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an
-1662190471
accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
1025343425

-1923438341
Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.  We had to walk two miles
1574843993
to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated.  We set out cold,
-491125964
we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost
1729938570
paralysed.  It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold
-186946406
meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary
1317210723
meals, was served round between the services.
-2137712001

-1923438341
At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly
-1884827125
road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits
2116960876
to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
556906344

-1923438341
I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping
-2028371764
line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close
1095402803
about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our
508144952
spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart soldiers."  The
1215313505
other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected
-2038640549
to attempt the task of cheering others.
181998045

-1923438341
How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
259776308
But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the
-1686419310
schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and
1627874113
behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their
-1231627676
starved arms in their pinafores.
1490542151

-1923438341
A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
230956777
bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of
-988201288
a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
1945724325
looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.  I generally contrived to reserve
240088581
a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was
1433961904
invariably obliged to part with.
1771682793

-1923438341
The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
-1274899158
Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and
-357434582
in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible
-1376742195
yawns attested her weariness.  A frequent interlude of these performances
-29437758
was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little
1471824537
girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the
304024302
third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.  The
-236119106
remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and
56811609
oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.  Sometimes their
-289615018
feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then
1228658258
propped up with the monitors' high stools.
-226346678

-1923438341
I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that
-248816005
gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after
-316965356
my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon:
-73682723
his absence was a relief to me.  I need not say that I had my own reasons
-128355069
for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
1853761282

-1923438341
One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
1878116540
with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
-1184205875
raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
617283929
passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when,
109640974
two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en masse_, it
-137256520
was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance
-1357135677
they thus greeted.  A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently
-309357168
beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column
-586546177
which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.  I
-1059264645
now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.  Yes, I was right: it
-1636140824
was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer,
-2057003598
narrower, and more rigid than ever.
1996244042

-1923438341
I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
-1320476962
remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition,
2010458613
&c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and
1886652081
the teachers of my vicious nature.  All along I had been dreading the
-963495930
fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the "Coming
-219671154
Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to
1769915976
brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
1344758043

-1923438341
He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not
-819771714
doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye
-648908067
with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on
-792726578
me a glance of repugnance and contempt.  I listened too; and as I
-734344043
happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what
-1358938245
he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
-1262511089

-1923438341
"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck
-1788584896
me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I
878037307
sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to
-1959644420
make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers
-1828825034
sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than
1880504879
one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be
1614966806
careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were
-384649268
better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden
1776962872
and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of
1675940739
black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in
-2118818796
them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."
1167418589

-1923438341
He paused.
540776580

-1923438341
"Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
-1757881266

-1923438341
"And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
1304824201
have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them
-1864518963
to one."
-1424800936

-1923438341
"I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine
-940079835
Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
1964531164
Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
-591805178
occasion."
1771671800

-1923438341
Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
-1735787617

-1923438341
"Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur
151670272
too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in
1497857924
settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread
-1013948930
and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past
2132011225
fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no
2071208702
such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by
-171045607
what authority?"
-1023588501

-1923438341
"I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
-775694898
"the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat
1285280022
it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
-1007664889

-1923438341
"Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up
-1251708693
these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence,
217618882
but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little
1715882405
accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of
-1908062937
a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not
-356764847
to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort
473924506
lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution;
472597068
it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by
1123013692
encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief
-2145910858
address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious
1418582996
instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of
1639050527
the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations
170582167
of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their
1252718594
cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread
-1251684288
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His
-2028841916
divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy
-1417188050
are ye."  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
-411368324
porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
-778818562
bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
-287393979

-1923438341
Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his feelings.  Miss
-212740873
Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
2033656533
gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
882005238
appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
-1238180349
especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
992950211
chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
-934898901
severity.
493429406

-1923438341
Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind
-593530439
his back, majestically surveyed the whole school.  Suddenly his eye gave
747644764
a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its
-1694357096
pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used--
-374329750

-1923438341
"Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
-1254228930
Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?"  And extending his cane he
-550304806
pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
-346002537

-1923438341
"It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
-2107028602

-1923438341
"Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why,
-1318272256
in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
-2135793582
conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable
-21150765
establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
-932588475

-1923438341
"Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.
10462148

-1923438341
"Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls
-1069909837
to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and
953122060
again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly,
1125453660
plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will
1835060897
send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the
252348211
excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first
906457355
form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
-291512634

-1923438341
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
-1913097012
the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and
195486695
when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
-1348896610
obeyed.  Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
-5544387
grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
388516563
Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
-811368378
whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside
723922506
was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
1860046599

-1923438341
He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then
242524164
pronounced sentence.  These words fell like the knell of doom--
-624266505

-1923438341
"All those top-knots must be cut off."
-31916421

-1923438341
Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
-37479025

-1923438341
"Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
984008367
this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
412283944
flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
-1233265342
sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young
1538761552
persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity
-112809636
itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the
1263589623
time wasted, of--"
150499880

-1923438341
Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now
36931304
entered the room.  They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard
-21951724
his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk,
1888061109
and furs.  The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
1973508526
seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
1614204565
plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
1146316745
profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
-949966096
enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
38119183
false front of French curls.
868549812

-1923438341
These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the
2105969861
Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the
-1250885959
room.  It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
1226886857
relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
-308715269
upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
-70952846
the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.  They now proceeded to
-1027619033
address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
1668018780
the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no
1274882727
time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted
379199775
my attention.
-500007858

-1923438341
Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
2051912030
Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
247964674
personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude
1098938372
observation.  To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while
-1802871236
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to
-1938831014
conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous
-1587109168
slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an
-1730221238
obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over
-435853784
now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied
2092113781
my forces for the worst.  It came.
-1940589714

-1923438341
"A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--"It is
1592418423
the new pupil, I perceive."  And before I could draw breath, "I must not
-1708390633
forget I have a word to say respecting her."  Then aloud: how loud it
1340273659
seemed to me!  "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
-2039800190

-1923438341
Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
1325939749
great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
762242675
towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
-1127985798
very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel--
-1116716537

-1923438341
"Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
2048622361
punished."
1679109571

-1923438341
The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
1578877584

-1923438341
"Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I; and
1324380071
an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my
348437249
pulses at the conviction.  I was no Helen Burns.
-966627260

-1923438341
"Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
47356411
from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
-1679663251

-1923438341
"Place the child upon it."
-1593463098

-1923438341
And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
-1095193999
note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
666881957
height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
-2048813303
that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
-658663422
silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
378270984

-1923438341
Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
252304682

-1923438341
"Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
415243651
children, you all see this girl?"
146440973

-1923438341
Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
124552478
against my scorched skin.
1416806241

-1923438341
"You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of
285040651
childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to
-1991284003
all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who
15813230
would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in
-1221774630
her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
-506327453

-1923438341
A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
1678141967
that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked,
-435374268
must be firmly sustained.
1127682036

-1923438341
"My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
1598576965
"this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
-1234610590
you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
-1120237353
castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and
-497887187
an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
-2025112462
example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
558463980
and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep
1781425171
your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions,
-232443885
punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible,
-1447629280
for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native
80100795
of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its
870744417
prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!"
300669676

-1923438341
Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect
-1330169270
possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce
45550559
their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the
-1505886854
elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones
-2007214813
whispered, "How shocking!"  Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
-107030941

-1923438341
"This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady
-438610861
who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and
1676632890
whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an
-1185125460
ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was
-721914426
obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious
-1977192380
example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be
-95832581
healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool
-1687771669
of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the
-490662452
waters to stagnate round her."
-2103195877

-1923438341
With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of
-1893066532
his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss
-767556162
Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
-1799043457
Turning at the door, my judge said--
-607639198

-1923438341
"Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to
-1661540015
her during the remainder of the day."
-1567027825

-1923438341
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
1158071481
shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
1012992920
exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.  What my sensations were
-701014358
no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath
-1401900770
and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she
2077555916
lifted her eyes.  What a strange light inspired them!  What an
-854800335
extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!  How the new feeling
-654814552
bore me up!  It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim,
-875962690
and imparted strength in the transit.  I mastered the rising hysteria,
-208154064
lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.  Helen Burns asked
-1871862087
some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the
1462757092
triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she
902191343
again went by.  What a smile!  I remember it now, and I know that it was
-1650616633
the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked
-313994464
lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from
1366931943
the aspect of an angel.  Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm
-670956435
"the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by
-1582762707
Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she
67130982
had blotted an exercise in copying it out.  Such is the imperfect nature
-516150983
of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes
-1097170628
like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to
1647704046
the full brightness of the orb.

-1923438341
CHAPTER VIII
1244996274

-1923438341

-1923438341
Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
1378525982
all were gone into the refectory to tea.  I now ventured to descend: it
1817940028
was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.  The
1073533979
spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
1027878473
took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
-1532457671
sank prostrate with my face to the ground.  Now I wept: Helen Burns was
-1121470978
not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my
-203699491
tears watered the boards.  I had meant to be so good, and to do so much
1134523566
at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
255823743
Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the
-1436843933
head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had
1720968952
smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me
1955575245
learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months
718597845
longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an
1763036530
equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay
639251481
again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
-401988553

-1923438341
"Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die.  While sobbing out this
2109076784
wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen
1487050463
Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long,
-732092972
vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
90283023

-1923438341
"Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as
-1826516709
if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.  Helen
-759642832
regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation,
671216735
though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.  She sat down on the
1919346973
ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head
62881711
upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian.  I was the
117240424
first who spoke--
340748446

-1923438341
"Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
993465147
liar?"
-365958645

-1923438341
"Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
-1428676814
called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
875864569

-1923438341
"But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me."
-1327730507

-1923438341
"Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
803119971
or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
-1586359042

-1923438341
"How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
-829297486

-1923438341
"Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
1671105237
he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had
-1782333505
he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
1881362727
declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
-281538490
offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on
-450044350
you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
-4244199
hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long
-1681309392
appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
1959757141
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
440868885

-1923438341
"Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
48104857
gently to warm them, and went on--
-423670613

-1923438341
"If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
-708178081
conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
-1337752874
without friends."
1970893168

-1923438341
"No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
1641136205
others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be
-2033140485
solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from
-527041251
you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
-870673813
submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to
-1132748160
stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--"
84522007

-1923438341
"Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too
-45736605
impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and
-205207087
put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble
-1727951446
self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides
1677347906
the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits:
179339856
that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us,
-1355422953
for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and
1555610859
shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see
-843601474
our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you
1190279616
are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously
-132993802
repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in
-154529040
your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the
985686611
separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why,
86535325
then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon
-1909643801
over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?"
1848633898

-1923438341
I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
-2119782399
there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.  I felt the impression of
927854294
woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
-1322321531
done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
-1316206170
momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
262842671

-1923438341
Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
-852745202
drew me to her, and we reposed in silence.  We had not sat long thus,
-1751003271
when another person came in.  Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
1328690681
rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through
-1544239722
a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which
927172592
we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
437502951

-1923438341
"I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
-376484490
room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
-43283764

-1923438341
We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
1590009254
intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
1402680331
apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.  Miss Temple
353285272
told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
1676850622
hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
-430668928

-1923438341
"Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face.  "Have you cried
-1757915215
your grief away?"
1665912519

-1923438341
"I am afraid I never shall do that."
1191403229

-1923438341
"Why?"
-1873626783

-1923438341
"Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else,
1849456919
will now think me wicked."
-178432834

-1923438341
"We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to
-1808525465
act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
865024846

-1923438341
"Shall I, Miss Temple?"
1852617446

-1923438341
"You will," said she, passing her arm round me.  "And now tell me who is
562521997
the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
1167013313

-1923438341
"Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
-935455668
care."
358051181

-1923438341
"Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
-2029911552

-1923438341
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often
-325979334
heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would
-335458837
always keep me."
-964606389

-1923438341
"Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
-999850637
criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
637222438
You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
409677075
you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
-518662691
exaggerate nothing."
-829569205

-1923438341
I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most
-1688523756
correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange
-630944629
coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad
-140757262
childhood.  Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it
-1960053167
generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's
-1991031225
warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the
-2091580369
narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.  Thus restrained
-95151281
and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss
-362786099
Temple fully believed me.
1715378524

-1923438341
In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see
-1047989283
me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the
-175546933
red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to
-1478086201
break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of
2103663538
agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication
1280268577
for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
-1640589173

-1923438341
I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
-165462308
then said--
-139190754

-1923438341
"I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees
1028050746
with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation;
238584898
to me, Jane, you are clear now."
-1832759989

-1923438341
She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
1797902436
contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
-561237403
contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white
1517066760
forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she
-206915152
proceeded to address Helen Burns.
-1744781570

-1923438341
"How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?"
-1365310750

-1923438341
"Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
984558955

-1923438341
"And the pain in your chest?"
464250269

-1923438341
"It is a little better."
752266871

-1923438341
Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
1162110624
returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low.  She
-188077962
was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully--
-748588678

-1923438341
"But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such."  She
1792744914
rang her bell.
670931830

-1923438341
"Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
984950604
tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
655924390

-1923438341
And a tray was soon brought.  How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
-370573505
and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
-729846194
How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
-1375192304
of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
747652930
discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
1600610555

-1923438341
"Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
-648766685
There is not enough for three."
511257784

-1923438341
Barbara went out: she returned soon--
-172959270

-1923438341
"Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
2018730512

-1923438341
Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
696014463
Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
-2087867640

-1923438341
"Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
1504831739
suppose."  And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
-1918236356
have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
540544338

-1923438341
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each
945975990
of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got
-1119025038
up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,
403620180
disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
563359199

-1923438341
"I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
-896541259
"but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
1790810311
proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
-428491288

-1923438341
We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
1222719907
delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
585586661
our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
1782616581
delicate fare she liberally supplied.
-1761933277

-1923438341
Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat
-492070027
one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between her and
706446805
Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
-1769786614

-1923438341
Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her
369414630
mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation
346167812
into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the
1291916321
pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling
156473661
sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was
-1518219747
struck with wonder.
746685848

-1923438341
The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her
1601564179
beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her
-1081646778
own unique mind, had roused her powers within her.  They woke, they
1398312283
kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till
1321595748
this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the
53150053
liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more
-1038022870
singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor
-1811485193
long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of
-2120218793
radiance.  Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what
-117604130
source I cannot tell.  Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough,
1960157247
vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid
877693744
eloquence?  Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to
173670313
me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hastening to live within a very
1627112796
brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
1419196811

-1923438341
They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past;
-2086104269
of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at:
-1257849267
they spoke of books: how many they had read!  What stores of knowledge
1733733340
they possessed!  Then they seemed so familiar with French names and
-209551842
French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple
1465034621
asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her
1040596457
father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and
-472512849
construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration
343896072
expanding at every sounding line.  She had scarcely finished ere the bell
589948321
announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us
1559269791
both, saying, as she drew us to her heart--
1488718436

-1923438341
"God bless you, my children!"
-1124381303

-1923438341
Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly;
-1878406843
it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her she a second
-521264802
time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.
1908018578

-1923438341
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
1870326994
examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
524752013
entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow
1013758644
she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her
-1526080224
shoulder.
-958709641

-1923438341
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a
258219072
low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
1127062998

-1923438341
Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
669910505
of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
2131855216
Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.  She wore
1832815583
it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
2113754227
punishment.  The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I
-184230048
ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which
1056793563
she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and
1867663822
large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her
1455486279
sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
-1418529590

-1923438341
About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
-1853022992
who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what
686018721
he said went to corroborate my account.  Miss Temple, having assembled
-219492765
the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges
241771752
alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to
-836130168
pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation.  The teachers
614309291
then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran
144845929
through the ranks of my companions.
2119423162

-1923438341
Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
-297354751
resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
-1866887647
my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
-426091037
tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
2067096239
weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
1221073522
allowed to commence French and drawing.  I learned the first two tenses
1339656253
of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-
91602645
bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the
-566876503
same day.  That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
-1287324241
imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
-1880479703
and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
1044062347
feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
-1493980480
dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
-184363743
picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings
-508001077
of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe
-600978306
cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with
1186819193
young ivy sprays.  I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my
-415057013
ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story
-1773808317
which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved
1220345954
to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
1551938317

-1923438341
Well has Solomon said--"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
1493150648
stalled ox and hatred therewith."
-1741047167

-1923438341
I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
1771428931
Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
-518745803

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER IX
-752232721

-1923438341

-1923438341
But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.  Spring
1393767725
drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
-1115392666
its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.  My wretched feet,
-1063458378
flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal
-347237876
and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
426326458
mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in
-1731588179
our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
285236648
sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
-34230052
greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested
-799947483
the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning
1713416734
brighter traces of her steps.  Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves;
1722298741
snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies.  On
468786756
Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still
422084361
sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
493165692

-1923438341
I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon
-1792405409
only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our
457494214
garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a
1104999370
great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of
1865815987
dark stones and sparkling eddies.  How different had this scene looked
929358895
when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in
-1811014090
frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the
1359008383
impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down "ing" and
-1451608280
holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!  That beck itself
-1386859950
was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and
-2007740444
sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or
1692748984
whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, _that_ showed only ranks
-1109003613
of skeletons.
1237261910

-1923438341
April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
-867328058
placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
-1909655043
duration.  And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its
513060012
tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak
-676834283
skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
1164595568
profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
-380158133
hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
591543009
wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
-1538412895
spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.  All this I enjoyed often
2055267175
and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
729901875
and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
-455464353
advert.
1883498571

-1923438341
Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
870263387
as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
1182612254
Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
1138446067
question.
873399967

-1923438341
That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
-114238684
pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the
-571129369
Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
938496454
dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
10464341
hospital.
1166808434

-1923438341
Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to
-1787913945
receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
452426756
time.  Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.  The few who continued well
-1467767797
were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
-1403728775
insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
1441045811
and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
-3389103
Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in
1593408223
the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at
-1351483158
night.  The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other
-457617986
necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were
-1943255360
fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove
-912313258
them from the seat of contagion.  Many, already smitten, went home only
-2022494120
to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the
322754412
nature of the malady forbidding delay.
461417455

-1923438341
While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
97068083
frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while
1886354504
its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the
800180245
pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that
-413640601
bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out
-763941942
of doors.  Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up
409460957
tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the
-800163008
borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double
-1504811342
daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of
290492797
spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most
-1446381175
of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of
-245826543
herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
1864986530

-1923438341
But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the
506410564
scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from
-1182054217
morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived
-928728579
better too.  Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now:
1659358521
household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was
-1040049334
gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been
-1630869038
matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her new abode,
1170428785
provided with comparative liberality.  Besides, there were fewer to feed;
-1054502642
the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when
-388768048
there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she
-1809590554
would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and
682156055
cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose
435526370
the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
1403579682

-1923438341
My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from
-725509219
the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the
1132377737
water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.  The stone was just broad enough
-94724631
to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen
1381813773
comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose
-645741287
society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original,
462721960
and partly because she had a manner which set me at my ease.  Some years
407854327
older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I
1336672935
liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults
1802669840
also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I
-1238089833
said.  She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform,
1400959129
I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much
2090121516
entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
213358313

-1923438341
And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?  Why did I not spend these sweet
2049025787
days of liberty with her?  Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
398511912
to have grown tired of her pure society?  Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
-2015377079
have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell
2039501557
me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose
203033782
to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified
-231779185
to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a taste of far
1782689385
higher things.
-1963619457

-1923438341
True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
-1639810268
being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
2121308567
Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
876330337
attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
160792085
my heart.  How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
711631093
all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which
-1566523770
ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?  But Helen was
991506458
ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I
201787100
knew not what room upstairs.  She was not, I was told, in the hospital
-703675034
portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was
1037264449
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance,
937551518
understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to
1431923648
alleviate.
-2007760503

-1923438341
I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
1225210236
downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple
-1784922826
into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and
791429189
speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not
2090560615
distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the
-1320190963
verandah.
-159766268

-1923438341
One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
1740889514
Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
-1597433239
others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask
-366012454
it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a
2006238917
herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.  When we got
1566696792
back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's,
1398342062
was standing at the garden door.  Mary Ann remarked that she supposed
-278647559
some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of
-2049315679
the evening.  She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to
641119262
plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and
1448518428
which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.  This done,
1804526143
I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew
2071544645
fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still
-283195732
glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon
979669867
rose with such majesty in the grave east.  I was noting these things and
-933779251
enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never
255315157
done before:--
901257378

-1923438341
"How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
-142744045
This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
109536093
have to go who knows where?"
-1201788525

-1923438341
And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
373351524
been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
-1760677312
it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
-289847801
side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one
-957317146
point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and
656143838
vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging
1752170962
amid that chaos.  While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door
930715298
open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.  After she had seen
-1618026604
him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I
-591831951
ran up to her.
907695682

-1923438341
"How is Helen Burns?"
-726365374

-1923438341
"Very poorly," was the answer.
-668536826

-1923438341
"Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
1290692708

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"And what does he say about her?"
1019449813

-1923438341
"He says she'll not be here long."
-822153913

-1923438341
This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
-1767160653
the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own
270827873
home.  I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I
-923151719
knew instantly now!  It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns
-831867047
was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be
-902120510
taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.  I experienced
-1333503757
a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a
877758462
necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
-2106400734

-1923438341
"She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
-946024021

-1923438341
"May I go up and speak to her?"
-1731228060

-1923438341
"Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
1891300231
you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
167608126

-1923438341
The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led
967685053
to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss
-2115096075
Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
1350370775

-1923438341
It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having
1762750178
been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
1427078440
dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose
461666446
softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
240459539
from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.  It was
1288289629
quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of
1638318047
the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows,
294572855
enabled me to find it without difficulty.  An odour of camphor and burnt
534233436
vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door
-757597126
quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.  I
741592821
dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_ see Helen,--I must
-356856670
embrace her before she died,--I must give her one last kiss, exchange
-480625926
with her one last word.
1940577808

-1923438341
Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and
-1506452711
succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached
536401136
another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me
446179378
was Miss Temple's room.  A light shone through the keyhole and from under
162602929
the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity.  Coming near, I
1087484295
found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the
-1129121956
close abode of sickness.  Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient
791432265
impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and
-153607170
looked in.  My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
860373767

-1923438341
Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
2046611979
there stood a little crib.  I saw the outline of a form under the
-1101223488
clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to
-92495082
in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
-1415481654
dimly on the table.  Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
147170298
that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.  I
-227590529
advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I
86859416
preferred speaking before I withdrew it.  I still recoiled at the dread
-1550710906
of seeing a corpse.
-1421944663

-1923438341
"Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
-1109844397

-1923438341
She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
1340240035
wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was
1444085096
instantly dissipated.
-350950694

-1923438341
"Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
-235932167

-1923438341
"Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
-2112610843
not speak and look so calmly if she were."
-1296685267

-1923438341
I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek
536129399
both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of
-457431094
old.
460849808

-1923438341
"Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
-1042270254
strike some minutes since."
254405985

-1923438341
"I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
-1437230103
sleep till I had spoken to you."
-1174837176

-1923438341
"You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
-840923857

-1923438341
"Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?"
1838572122

-1923438341
"Yes; to my long home--my last home."
-102259300

-1923438341
"No, no, Helen!"  I stopped, distressed.  While I tried to devour my
-1804944554
tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
-1702778569
nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
151237194
whispered--
-2005928488

-1923438341
"Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
1831755020
quilt."
-636654182

-1923438341
I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her.  After a
-381804887
long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
70595272

-1923438341
"I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
-1470481759
sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die
36990028
one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
689495589
gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me
2101369265
much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
-9834023
me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not
923429167
qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have
443030769
been continually at fault."
-131922557

-1923438341
"But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?"
743854205

-1923438341
"I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
-1019584572

-1923438341
"Where is God?  What is God?"
-2065193001

-1923438341
"My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely
753633032
implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the
-2023615342
hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
818635609
reveal Him to me."
-1180437365

-1923438341
"You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
-132507196
that our souls can get to it when we die?"
1225993052

-1923438341
"I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
1198816289
my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is
1489705479
my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
-2094021784

-1923438341
"And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
1558933704

-1923438341
"You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
1569710723
mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
1442785257

-1923438341
Again I questioned, but this time only in thought.  "Where is that
-1222339147
region?  Does it exist?"  And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
2102083821
seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay
-67602943
with my face hidden on her neck.  Presently she said, in the sweetest
1732535098
tone--
-911856540

-1923438341
"How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
-231185587
I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you
-1682415282
near me."
1723400918

-1923438341
"I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
-998472262

-1923438341
"Are you warm, darling?"
1903571386

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Good-night, Jane."
1178958992

-1923438341
"Good-night, Helen."
-266699752

-1923438341
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
-485929160

-1923438341
When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
1008289359
was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
-1789356726
the passage back to the dormitory.  I was not reprimanded for leaving my
-17208612
bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
-1689052781
afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned
-1930339709
that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid
1248120852
in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round
1588177553
her neck.  I was asleep, and Helen was--dead.
706629681

-1923438341
Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
-173272838
death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet
1942585095
marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word "Resurgam."
2090966843

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER X
-1160083791

-1923438341

-1923438341
Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant
766112341
existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many
902283823
chapters.  But this is not to be a regular autobiography.  I am only
-437821254
bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some
587094137
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in
1069955200
silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of
-468924673
connection.
-1666956390

-1923438341
When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood,
-1655334227
it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the
1344033231
number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.  Inquiry
1586098233
was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts
227364145
came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.  The
2045400125
unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's
706221005
food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils'
-1856554888
wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered,
-124737407
and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but
-1963380562
beneficial to the institution.
-1766468028

-1923438341
Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed
-2071369408
largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better
-74984909
situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing
1725769794
introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a
380859177
committee.  Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family
-1211244781
connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of
-1425108521
treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen
1552157336
of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector,
-1914738069
too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness,
-602599410
comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.  The school, thus
113437707
improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.  I
-75246482
remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years:
-1317351544
six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my
-1544445484
testimony to its value and importance.
1838655800

-1923438341
During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it
-756059943
was not inactive.  I had the means of an excellent education placed
-9166024
within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel
1453879235
in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially
-514185937
such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages
-653885393
offered me.  In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then
-364877213
I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal
-415326561
for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
-1287916444

-1923438341
Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent
1709647985
of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my
-926614723
acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;
1794205250
she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,
-1962999991
companion.  At this period she married, removed with her husband (a
-1773282974
clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant
-1188211242
county, and consequently was lost to me.
-132609155

-1923438341
From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every
-1481745554
settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a
864680877
home to me.  I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of
7151619
her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated
-1666639384
feelings had become the inmates of my mind.  I had given in allegiance to
-1016709913
duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of
277928915
others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued
1817728433
character.
1198779625

-1923438341
But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and
934767663
Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,
964460551
shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill
-977763458
and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there
1124515013
spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour
-1816093624
of the occasion.
-724150372

-1923438341
I walked about the chamber most of the time.  I imagined myself only to
-2029930343
be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my
157240870
reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon
1948675152
was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me,
-504666495
namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that
-714931354
my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that
1352359223
she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her
-697287434
vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to
265505076
feel the stirring of old emotions.  It did not seem as if a prop were
2128246976
withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to
-1380173731
be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no
-2116628836
more.  My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been
689578263
of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide,
-729127037
and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and
1865613511
excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse,
764656143
to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
-443970588

-1923438341
I went to my window, opened it, and looked out.  There were the two wings
-982415075
of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood;
-88253271
there was the hilly horizon.  My eye passed all other objects to rest on
-1525601962
those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all
-624027952
within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile
2024309628
limits.  I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain,
870660888
and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
59081685
I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I
530532995
remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have
-1087377696
elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never
1007789605
quitted it since.  My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed
-826720513
had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had
-252767207
ever been to visit me.  I had had no communication by letter or message
-1366778337
with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and
-2119588047
notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and
-598841896
preferences, and antipathies--such was what I knew of existence.  And now
1955285107
I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in
130248297
one afternoon.  I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I
-1343684268
uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.  I
-650947479
abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus:
-745579463
that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: "Then," I cried,
-186916727
half desperate, "grant me at least a new servitude!"
-381573106

-1923438341
Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
1611936641

-1923438341
I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till
-1810836005
bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me
2083184937
from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of
-57052153
small talk.  How I wished sleep would silence her.  It seemed as if,
-1678494471
could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood
165503329
at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
834032993

-1923438341
Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her
1332055929
habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light
-812866954
than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with
1997242906
satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought
1050337717
instantly revived.
-1086287808

-1923438341
"A new servitude!  There is something in that," I soliloquised (mentally,
887480283
be it understood; I did not talk aloud), "I know there is, because it
744660087
does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty,
1797136174
Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds
-1347728685
for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to
1206842985
listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one
1521427726
may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve
-1410052228
elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing
692529909
feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain
-1337967391
active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it."
-627666987

-1923438341
I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly
-948842543
night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to
352410780
think_ again with all my might.
-473715574

-1923438341
"What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under
-449541325
new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything
-1900196641
better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I
-345427202
suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends,
1479577425
who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is
-2090452427
their resource?"
1509697909

-1923438341
I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a
1118545531
response, and quickly.  It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses
1755284763
throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos;
-1900599628
and no result came of its efforts.  Feverish with vain labour, I got up
1908673162
and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two,
-1064013279
shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
-231794283

-1923438341
A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion
1945236859
on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my
-1346970564
mind.--"Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the
-88633168
_---shire Herald_."
1051024145

-1923438341
"How?  I know nothing about advertising."
-595414125

-1923438341
Replies rose smooth and prompt now:--
1624653341

-1923438341
"You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a
47946390
cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first
661900923
opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed
2015941829
to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week
-826823586
after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly."
-687445117

-1923438341
This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I
-1547717081
had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
-209730064

-1923438341
With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed,
-862959503
and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
-207367348

-1923438341
"A young lady accustomed to tuition" (had I not been a teacher two
72985746
years?) "is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family
241873921
where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely
-1205937897
eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my
-2051688666
own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English
1152239509
education, together with French, Drawing, and Music" (in those days,
306539966
reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been
34971081
held tolerably comprehensive).  "Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, ---
-890697674
shire."
-1505981222

-1923438341
This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked
-1399470956
leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some
-1642006903
small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers;
1312689816
permission was readily granted; I went.  It was a walk of two miles, and
724682161
the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or
-1947593020
two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy
-1880832281
rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
-572264367

-1923438341
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like
783629767
all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant
1902153106
autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.  A picturesque
-41551469
track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through
-1816352804
the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the
-204861511
letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh
-278660164
whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
298218824

-1923438341
My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of
434407364
shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I
-1827268174
stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to
621242065
the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on
1697292800
her nose, and black mittens on her hands.
1573347730

-1923438341
"Are there any letters for J.E.?" I asked.
1469846050

-1923438341
She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and
-750217208
fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began
1583809800
to falter.  At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly
1285087154
five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act
1224207776
by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
-1765604669

-1923438341
"Is there only one?" I demanded.
-730601508

-1923438341
"There are no more," said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my
-51943016
face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by
80600757
eight, and it was already half-past seven.
-1463016571

-1923438341
Various duties awaited me on my arrival.  I had to sit with the girls
1060311991
during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see
1128153911
them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.  Even when we
18479463
finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my
-272552524
companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I
201761414
dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately,
-1381183182
however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she
-1541356735
was already snoring before I had finished undressing.  There still
1579303113
remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an
1464675749
initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
197407637

-1923438341
"If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday,
176076829
possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give
-1445901039
satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can
-772490147
be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten
-562107923
years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is
-219302633
requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the
-327700402
direction:--
-919312981

-1923438341
"Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire."
-1045860875

-1923438341
I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather
-1846315400
uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.  This circumstance was
64816353
satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for
132885484
myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some
-161110279
scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be
458064899
respectable, proper, _en regle_.  I now felt that an elderly lady was no
1155185635
bad ingredient in the business I had on hand.  Mrs. Fairfax!  I saw her
-635573503
in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a
1766821074
model of elderly English respectability.  Thornfield! that, doubtless,
-1786814788
was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I
1152929090
failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
945599737
Millcote, ---shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England,
-1799186482
yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.  ---shire was seventy miles
-319731062
nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a
935159406
recommendation to me.  I longed to go where there was life and movement:
-33610346
Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy
-134463433
place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete
-1602455815
change at least.  Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of
-2100674583
long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will,
-232890454
probably, be a good way from the town."
-1893768924

-1923438341
Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.
28870121

-1923438341
Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined
324841543
to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
658378578
Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the
-859809199
noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new
671634719
situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at
-1825389504
Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the
-43948368
matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and
1993396728
ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.  She
1274995022
obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.  The next day she
1212683146
laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be
1429077403
written to, as she was my natural guardian.  A note was accordingly
261003667
addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that "I might do as I
932448438
pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs."  This
687387668
note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to
473941000
me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition
454517659
if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself
-2084316152
well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character
-2147335469
and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should
2121592370
forthwith be furnished me.
839831662

-1923438341
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a
1849870022
copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she
1269982856
was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my
1931927200
assuming the post of governess in her house.
-1609902118

-1923438341
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly.  I had
-574017408
not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the
2121587298
last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight
-2030961231
years ago from Gateshead.
486824973

-1923438341
The box was corded, the card nailed on.  In half-an-hour the carrier was
2033715536
to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an
594236452
early hour the next morning to meet the coach.  I had brushed my black
588289311
stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in
1901743544
all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having
-271789937
nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.  I could not; though I
-1223064804
had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too
1129526320
much excited.  A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening
-309776658
to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly
-978893634
while the change was being accomplished.
-1440568199

-1923438341
"Miss," said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering
-896791717
like a troubled spirit, "a person below wishes to see you."
-827816731

-1923438341
"The carrier, no doubt," I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.  I
275572619
was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which
387459540
was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
-1802897511

-1923438341
"It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!" cried the
122246700
individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.
-837460982

-1923438341
I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,
-1745838536
yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively
-1898061774
complexion.
1857420155

-1923438341
"Well, who is it?" she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half
-223107139
recognised; "you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?"
-65043986

-1923438341
In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: "Bessie!
-67005919
Bessie!  Bessie!" that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half
-634581266
cried, and we both went into the parlour.  By the fire stood a little
-237933796
fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.
75408047

-1923438341
"That is my little boy," said Bessie directly.
-465573319

-1923438341
"Then you are married, Bessie?"
831910657

-1923438341
"Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a
-2126782253
little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane."
546554081

-1923438341
"And you don't live at Gateshead?"
1221246229

-1923438341
"I live at the lodge: the old porter has left."
1918574158

-1923438341
"Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them,
337604016
Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will
-1273915929
you?" but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.
1141413215

-1923438341
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued
-1252530632
Mrs. Leaven.  "I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss
-537491134
Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana
1703633347
would make two of you in breadth."
-1478043073

-1923438341
"Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?"
-608219457

-1923438341
"Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there
808890973
everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his
-281114481
relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss
1345997737
Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It
-1558203186
was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she
-1303486761
and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always
-1553098522
quarrelling--"
312509488

-1923438341
"Well, and what of John Reed?"
-1109283773

-1923438341
"Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college,
1292388050
and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him
592920073
to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young
623770378
man, they will never make much of him, I think."
-575319117

-1923438341
"What does he look like?"
-610921418

-1923438341
"He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he
1343244140
has such thick lips."
-2111232022

-1923438341
"And Mrs. Reed?"
1056197032

-1923438341
"Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not
437902287
quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends
-1820189365
a deal of money."
-1107813004

-1923438341
"Did she send you here, Bessie?"
1535476348

-1923438341
"No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that
43909124
there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part
694299619
of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before
1356524340
you were quite out of my reach."
-103690845

-1923438341
"I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie."  I said this laughing:
16449106
I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no
-262468279
shape denote admiration.
2039126016

-1923438341
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a
1671497915
lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as
1395135400
a child."
-1443272503

-1923438341
I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I
-1585161496
confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most
-456608873
people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior
-553471611
likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
594735586

-1923438341
"I dare say you are clever, though," continued Bessie, by way of solace.
898413409
"What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?"
-80933728

-1923438341
"A little."
-83007213

-1923438341
There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me
-131817813
to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was
-723376533
charmed.
-1298280959

-1923438341
"The Miss Reeds could not play as well!" said she exultingly.  "I always
-906091691
said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?"
-643106606

-1923438341
"That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece."  It was a landscape
-1430300895
in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in
2042931931
acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf,
1033354029
and which she had framed and glazed.
-584743447

-1923438341
"Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss
1368198236
Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves,
323205982
who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?"
635360795

-1923438341
"Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it."
2050960102

-1923438341
"And you can work on muslin and canvas?"
407185519

-1923438341
"I can."
-1653884195

-1923438341
"Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get
-673736785
on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I
1837440136
wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's
-589816327
kinsfolk, the Eyres?"
743991318

-1923438341
"Never in my life."
567885787

-1923438341
"Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:
1014788723
and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds
1480010186
are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead
-578428226
and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he
-755657468
seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a
-1491551562
voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a
14411632
day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your
-52383089
father's brother."
-1156795214

-1923438341
"What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?"
579335122

-1923438341
"An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did
1312201413
tell me--"
-484744439

-1923438341
"Madeira?" I suggested.
-1437216979

-1923438341
"Yes, that is it--that is the very word."
1990244533

-1923438341
"So he went?"
1560045418

-1923438341
"Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high
-279530742
with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert
-2107624141
believes he was a wine-merchant."
-34296291

-1923438341
"Very likely," I returned; "or perhaps clerk or agent to a
1834930437
wine-merchant."
-1266326234

-1923438341
Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was
1520649964
obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning
-330760512
at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.  We parted finally at the
-331268891
door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set
-986885364
off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take
-1514840853
her back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new
2141056084
duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
-1849051683

-1923438341
CHAPTER XI
-224656838

-1923438341

-1923438341
A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and
-1875615600
when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a
1481371915
room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on
1446824146
the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such
2119992976
ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George
-90446048
the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of
2127983646
the death of Wolfe.  All this is visible to you by the light of an oil
479429632
lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near
37474584
which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the
-228040743
table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen
1162615532
hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four
-462480428
o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
1541153910

-1923438341
Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in
-950035674
my mind.  I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one
-2060083910
to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the
-1863650141
"boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced,
1653566652
and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to
562085437
Thornfield.  Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter
506734568
if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the
-447170032
negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private
498691863
room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are
-1377214709
troubling my thoughts.
693516122

-1923438341
It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself
419546687
quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain
1949785381
whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by
-830833565
many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.  The charm of
164445938
adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then
985689819
the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when
1852804375
half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring
252330323
the bell.
2088725571

-1923438341
"Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?" I asked of
2034127508
the waiter who answered the summons.
-261330461

-1923438341
"Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar."  He
1246199824
vanished, but reappeared instantly--
748201517

-1923438341
"Is your name Eyre, Miss?"
2011923274

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Person here waiting for you."
-1905376842

-1923438341
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the
64283814
inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit
-1096685408
street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
-1386305060

-1923438341
"This will be your luggage, I suppose?" said the man rather abruptly when
2112604416
he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
-1144197122

-1923438341
"Yes."  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and
723887296
then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to
-1098884323
Thornfield.
1261304349

-1923438341
"A matter of six miles."
1349594048

-1923438341
"How long shall we be before we get there?"
15003288

-1923438341
"Happen an hour and a half."
668610823

-1923438341
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set
-1678667763
off.  Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I
1523622370
was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I
-1223488978
leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated
371624518
much at my ease.
1481239572

-1923438341
"I suppose," thought I, "judging from the plainness of the servant and
-1953481661
carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better;
1785443819
I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with
1620071645
them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if
1209139607
she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her;
-429611888
I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always
-1210012039
answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and
-222853015
succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always
1183123267
spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second
1779489298
Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the
996093408
worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our
-321852322
road now, I wonder?"
-539261838

-1923438341
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by
-734515565
the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude,
-1880000160
much larger than Lowton.  We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort
-52885154
of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt
2045904848
we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque;
1678743433
more stirring, less romantic.
-524279392

-1923438341
The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk
1783350166
all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two
-2079187005
hours; at last he turned in his seat and said--
804674239

-1923438341
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
1666053728

-1923438341
Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower
1207270612
against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow
-711893219
galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.  About
1999643123
ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we
-1958992415
passed through, and they clashed to behind us.  We now slowly ascended a
-966828401
drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from
1232437982
one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.  The car stopped at the
1355053614
front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
327027784

-1923438341
"Will you walk this way, ma'am?" said the girl; and I followed her across
-736640059
a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose
1853340937
double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting
189449066
as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours
-1844007238
inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented
274950389
itself to my view.
1094175046

-1923438341
A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-
-2071204623
backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little
341992668
elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;
-1356964298
exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and
286760573
milder looking.  She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely
1049634843
at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of
-1188144711
domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess
517309064
could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no
-1218132906
stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and
1156624852
promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
-972393485

-1923438341
"How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John
-528967071
drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire."
-836512373

-1923438341
"Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?" said I.
1511894864

-1923438341
"Yes, you are right: do sit down."
-958537160

-1923438341
She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and
1404783314
untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much
-126293099
trouble.
596833002

-1923438341
"Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with
-46403984
cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are
-7942560
the keys of the storeroom."
598735111

-1923438341
And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and
-1767531405
delivered them to the servant.
-1049577373

-1923438341
"Now, then, draw nearer to the fire," she continued.  "You've brought
796835121
your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?"
-1929378293

-1923438341
"Yes, ma'am."
237031514

-1923438341
"I'll see it carried into your room," she said, and bustled out.
-629129607

-1923438341
"She treats me like a visitor," thought I.  "I little expected such a
2138835736
reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like
769437389
what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult
452838443
too soon."
-1727359477

-1923438341
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a
1702829502
book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now
-542367617
brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.  I felt rather
-1753097627
confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before
1689436076
received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she
1993869597
did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,
1377847706
I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.
-1014350959

-1923438341
"Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?" I asked,
1404734047
when I had partaken of what she offered me.
-360098997

-1923438341
"What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf," returned the good lady,
-580913193
approaching her ear to my mouth.
-1107456172

-1923438341
I repeated the question more distinctly.
-906270287

-1923438341
"Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your
-530559062
future pupil."
1492021044

-1923438341
"Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?"
679922256

-1923438341
"No,--I have no family."
1443773091

-1923438341
I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss
930649194
Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask
1241170100
too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
1704714736

-1923438341
"I am so glad," she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took
599035977
the cat on her knee; "I am so glad you are come; it will be quite
1794159075
pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at
1867643325
any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late
-2116317020
years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in
-1210442825
winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say
-1096308090
alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very
-618022651
decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't
-149874191
converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due
-811975817
distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it
861945023
was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it
533427069
rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the
-1181162919
house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy
699842900
with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me
-366571039
sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt
-1113616043
it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long
-341959339
days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this
-1968253335
autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house
-87917905
alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay."
-1332506912

-1923438341
My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew
1602790957
my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish that she
1172482865
might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.
-1017255175

-1923438341
"But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night," said she; "it is on the
-119074621
stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel
1338644945
tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your
-1456143491
bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a
-1558305972
small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the
-1623751681
large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are
-1377094646
so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself."
1995325207

-1923438341
I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued
-722134421
with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.  She took her
31286744
candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the
-1255299433
hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the
-176839087
way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window
-1643922362
was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the
-313885118
bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a
1098410777
house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,
-1621661168
suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when
1800827770
finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and
1747603802
furnished in ordinary, modern style.
-446899276

-1923438341
When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my
-1954505619
door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie
-289892621
impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and
-2070723749
that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I
1575090398
remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was
1597908677
now at last in safe haven.  The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart,
-482487768
and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were
-2052000760
due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and
-732737984
the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me
1537691714
before it was earned.  My couch had no thorns in it that night; my
-1502391722
solitary room no fears.  At once weary and content, I slept soon and
-813725108
soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.
-1990283202

-1923438341
The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in
999145390
between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a
-2016680802
carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood,
-314258435
that my spirits rose at the view.  Externals have a great effect on the
-1196689228
young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that
-1806229196
was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
811118405
My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to
-528741500
hope, seemed all astir.  I cannot precisely define what they expected,
614616739
but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at
-1167723261
an indefinite future period.
-2030726262

-1923438341
I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no
-244836531
article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still
1550356637
by nature solicitous to be neat.  It was not my habit to be disregardful
-980367660
of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I
809306778
ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want
1353426699
of beauty would permit.  I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer;
179660678
I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry
198025330
mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I
-725036724
felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so
-489101425
irregular and so marked.  And why had I these aspirations and these
734674557
regrets?  It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say
-1708841665
it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
-1136489635
However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black
-267746674
frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to
759921035
a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do
-387915006
respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil
-509618373
would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.  Having opened my
891077814
chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the
273622012
toilet table, I ventured forth.
614323105

-1923438341
Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of
534601835
oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some
-1445924904
pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a
-25444893
cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a
-2126635091
bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of
-1469308531
oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.  Everything
-1387860858
appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little
305791362
accustomed to grandeur.  The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood
1648655275
open; I stepped over the threshold.  It was a fine autumn morning; the
-1835264671
early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
879844090
advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the
44380210
mansion.  It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though
1162973805
considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:
631683332
battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front
-2039001634
stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants
1050432777
were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a
-934637014
great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where
-1327381326
an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at
-1844197608
once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off
2107192763
were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so
-467163287
like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and
477046694
lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I
-704999424
had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of
1486190957
Millcote.  A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled
-1969026831
up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood
789193775
nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the
-454198137
house and gates.
1610448116

-1923438341
I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet
-226997908
listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the
-1862541836
wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for
821317646
one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady
-1207739040
appeared at the door.
-1144916120

-1923438341
"What! out already?" said she.  "I see you are an early riser."  I went
532654094
up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
-1601180023

-1923438341
"How do you like Thornfield?" she asked.  I told her I liked it very
370797701
much.
279194064

-1923438341
"Yes," she said, "it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out
179789558
of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and
-700494382
reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great
-1437901585
houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor."
1406087415

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester!" I exclaimed.  "Who is he?"
1643949133

-1923438341
"The owner of Thornfield," she responded quietly.  "Did you not know he
893832937
was called Rochester?"
-1417961950

-1923438341
Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady
1047468428
seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with
-727051689
which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
-2018304165

-1923438341
"I thought," I continued, "Thornfield belonged to you."
-1666038238

-1923438341
"To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the
-1866510352
housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the
-205231173
Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a
-1888009227
clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and
1962839884
that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother
742639833
was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on
-1924085912
the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in
-1463196053
the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I
685609750
expect nothing more."
-283049679

-1923438341
"And the little girl--my pupil!"
1613384128

-1923438341
"She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for
17576693
her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here
-433762309
she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse."  The enigma then
1403137377
was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but
867781749
a dependant like myself.  I did not like her the worse for that; on the
-455180297
contrary, I felt better pleased than ever.  The equality between her and
-1535979011
me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so much
363745758
the better--my position was all the freer.
-533054624

-1923438341
As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her
1400809238
attendant, came running up the lawn.  I looked at my pupil, who did not
1866159063
at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or
-978136070
eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a
571195163
redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.
137832121

-1923438341
"Good morning, Miss Adela," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Come and speak to the
12822099
lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day."  She
-1907593752
approached.
435189560

-1923438341
"C'est la ma gouverante!" said she, pointing to me, and addressing her
-222122438
nurse; who answered--
-1182952827

-1923438341
"Mais oui, certainement."
-943848968

-1923438341
"Are they foreigners?" I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.
-1212141485

-1923438341
"The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I
1958046347
believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came
-790652887
here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a
1705423731
little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will
-491603650
make out her meaning very well, I dare say."
-653317338

-1923438341
Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French
-569915631
lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot
-943928376
as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt
-877397947
a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my
1615097251
accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my
1780296191
teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in
-255488497
the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle
-1638071296
Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her
1908264579
governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to
-1646653625
her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were
243841129
seated at the table, and she had examined me some ten minutes with her
-1530558019
large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
1527807442

-1923438341
"Ah!" cried she, in French, "you speak my language as well as Mr.
747080191
Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She
1142854095
will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.
359277418
Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a
1332180357
chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was
1282786232
Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a
1958150660
pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another
-1366975773
place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And
-1783468483
Mademoiselle--what is your name?"
597786475

-1923438341
"Eyre--Jane Eyre."
-629903357

-1923438341
"Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning,
1085394367
before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very
1895506814
dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came
-985987838
from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land,
927453470
and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a
-1324450482
beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We
-418677859
stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a
2018464110
great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many
1500878933
children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I
-860730727
fed with crumbs."
-1516519446

-1923438341
"Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?" asked Mrs. Fairfax.
734703442

-1923438341
I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent
-250763527
tongue of Madame Pierrot.
808863727

-1923438341
"I wish," continued the good lady, "you would ask her a question or two
-1351507528
about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?"
-795718954

-1923438341
"Adele," I inquired, "with whom did you live when you were in that pretty
123097837
clean town you spoke of?"
-1927496342

-1923438341
"I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama
786587505
used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many
-1281892543
gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,
1363552248
or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you
-701273306
hear me sing now?"
-607023381

-1923438341
She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of
-1672047278
her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed
-892060357
herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,
-360589833
shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced
1125810264
singing a song from some opera.  It was the strain of a forsaken lady,
-1644852326
who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid;
-202219835
desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest
-1022443212
robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove
1445484268
to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has
1389739012
affected her.
561002825

-1923438341
The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose
1980452176
the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy
-1871864242
warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was:
-613426005
at least I thought so.
1066554148

-1923438341
Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the _naivete_ of her
-585946855
age.  This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, "Now,
1306328419
Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry."
-1912155024

-1923438341
Assuming an attitude, she began, "La Ligue des Rats: fable de La
-1941960044
Fontaine."  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to
-829479001
punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness
-1952095674
of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had been
2054295682
carefully trained.
1950545812

-1923438341
"Was it your mama who taught you that piece?" I asked.
408000374

-1923438341
"Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui
-2014436886
dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me
-895090768
to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?"
-418317725

-1923438341
"No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you
1609341857
say, with whom did you live then?"
-781681327

-1923438341
"With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is
1498459332
nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a
1912538010
house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would
1748540299
like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.
612775420
Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and
-663177471
gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word,
953561950
for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself,
1230710068
and I never see him."
-931745170

-1923438341
After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it
1477822739
appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
-1949937724
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one
1842007885
bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way
1012218902
of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry,
-784452168
biography, travels, a few romances, &c.  I suppose he had considered that
-1203853283
these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and,
1165034389
indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty
-1304326617
pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to
474692113
offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.  In this
27684317
room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone;
-97307804
also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
1408370174

-1923438341
I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she
1394796243
had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.  I felt it would be
-2126419182
injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to
337984443
her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had
2044385
advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse.  I then proposed
-199043763
to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her
-334227409
use.
786776451

-1923438341
As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax
1004092722
called to me: "Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose," said
1962185726
she.  She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in
-890125912
when she addressed me.  It was a large, stately apartment, with purple
-1054147467
chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast
804419383
window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.  Mrs.
-1923153310
Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a
762224634
sideboard.
-1103307290

-1923438341
"What a beautiful room!" I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never
-1510292616
before seen any half so imposing.
-252893794

-1923438341
"Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in
914642258
a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that
-2101836359
are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault."
714087678

-1923438341
She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it
1074240171
with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.  Mounting to it by two broad
-1742134874
steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy
-1499531345
place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.  Yet it was
1615621810
merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
1504247257
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;
194811180
both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath
1482955630
which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the
-500250040
ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian
-564068151
glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the
-1685452542
general blending of snow and fire.
-1133378085

-1923438341
"In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!" said I.  "No dust, no
-1454694933
canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they
724350962
were inhabited daily."
1113540773

-1923438341
"Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are
-174082751
always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to
-1243005056
find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his
-940039531
arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness."
1662459681

-1923438341
"Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?"
-1807324614

-1923438341
"Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he
2103938857
expects to have things managed in conformity to them."
1074065343

-1923438341
"Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?"
200196968

-1923438341
"Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the
-982422486
land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the
-343193991
Rochesters time out of mind."
960272768

-1923438341
"Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he
1505591475
liked for himself?"
-118630314

-1923438341
"I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is
-643034078
considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never
725560147
lived much amongst them."
-1198250466

-1923438341
"But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?"
1445411880

-1923438341
"Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,
1512809892
perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the
1409695675
world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much
-1696198780
conversation with him."
-386821564

-1923438341
"In what way is he peculiar?"
290320945

-1923438341
"I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel
1698233065
it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest
-1114211202
or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly
1614865460
understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,
-1294079795
he is a very good master."
-343006672

-1923438341
This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and
-1583191975
mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a
-502659319
character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons
-2122327276
or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries
1977590150
puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in
-1065781175
her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired
-1013720342
and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more
1273305930
definite notion of his identity.
-842241355

-1923438341
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of
-1712656622
the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I
-797095216
went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I
-723973893
thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark
-366257967
and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture
-205257143
once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been
43200420
removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by
1824162648
their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in
1495654651
oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and
1442655567
cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,
-59792355
high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned
-656530440
tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by
-1371907866
fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.  All these relics
-57118734
gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the
-1111189577
past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of
-1637769461
these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on
-344644615
one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of
2000226988
oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick
1142295394
work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and
-385757534
strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by
1808661969
the pallid gleam of moonlight.
803001805

-1923438341
"Do the servants sleep in these rooms?" I asked.
-1612075939

-1923438341
"No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever
794221007
sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at
667146406
Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt."
83458273

-1923438341
"So I think: you have no ghost, then?"
1843839807

-1923438341
"None that I ever heard of," returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
-184617091

-1923438341
"Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?"
-1777197689

-1923438341
"I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a
-917936164
violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the
-527259951
reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now."
-1920028267

-1923438341
"Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'" I muttered.  "Where
1079240621
are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
977202181

-1923438341
"On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?"  I
-1137208788
followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a
-608596506
ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.  I was now on a
1470794341
level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests.  Leaning over
-747649244
the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out
-906449928
like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of
-165553469
the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber;
1896183796
the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with
1897941350
moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road,
-416370155
the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon
1651554784
bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.  No
-2113961094
feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.  When I
1629625547
turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way
-857948850
down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that
-1637989660
arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene
-1819027703
of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and
1905929615
over which I had been gazing with delight.
2053203258

-1923438341
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift
-470055462
of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the
11462072
narrow garret staircase.  I lingered in the long passage to which this
725639232
led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,
694452822
low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,
-1751418219
with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some
904831395
Bluebeard's castle.
857647361

-1923438341
While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a
-590647691
region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,
1818944068
formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it
1207863124
began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.  It
301728527
passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every
1350906752
lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed
-2009506523
out the door whence the accents issued.
1007499687

-1923438341
"Mrs. Fairfax!" I called out: for I now heard her descending the great
-320489257
stairs.  "Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?"
1589266007

-1923438341
"Some of the servants, very likely," she answered: "perhaps Grace Poole."
-1262835410

-1923438341
"Did you hear it?" I again inquired.
-411540053

-1923438341
"Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.
1001484714
Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together."
-1658055069

-1923438341
The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an
-2075280797
odd murmur.
1636378041

-1923438341
"Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.
-1952357412

-1923438341
I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,
-23791873
as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high
-2066000017
noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious
224385556
cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should
-822759274
have been superstitiously afraid.  However, the event showed me I was a
-271306196
fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
-608344050

-1923438341
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between
-1254538870
thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard,
1525113400
plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely
-2084540704
be conceived.
725652857

-1923438341
"Too much noise, Grace," said Mrs. Fairfax.  "Remember directions!"  Grace
-1780347089
curtseyed silently and went in.
-231287700

-1923438341
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,"
-434317743
continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but
589161435
she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new
-132957625
pupil this morning?"
-970743883

-1923438341
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the
-1105961775
light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the
-1719022484
hall, exclaiming--
-875253244

-1923438341
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
-1694247927

-1923438341
We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
-1375060283

CHAPTER XII
-624030778

-1923438341

-1923438341
The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
-450097989
Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance
-132633964
with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she
-1015101738
appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education
-673471040
and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been
423221999
spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was
977901459
committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any
-2020680826
quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her
830574865
little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great
-503490051
talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of
1289995464
feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of
263654355
childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her
1766491629
below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,
659879744
though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay
880767505
prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of
-1106102552
attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
1675515616

-1923438341
This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who
1168443456
entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the
1148771604
duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
1604506174
idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to
-772139921
echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a
1592166685
conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet
-1647276133
liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a
562093218
thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
-1814080166
proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
1948204432
of her mind and character.
-154576462

-1923438341
Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
757792001
when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
1785255190
gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played
260563378
with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed
2096658056
the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having
-1035679253
reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and
2074739485
along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might
841825282
overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions
-1442924645
full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of
2020737115
practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind,
-1440437633
of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
2061558278
I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I
-1558913557
believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and
-2126058269
what I believed in I wished to behold.
986147349

-1923438341
Who blames me?  Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.  I
-1649574961
could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
1708469372
pain sometimes.  Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
605127802
the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
1087455237
solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright
-667174566
visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to
1054357315
let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled
49330550
it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward
807706529
ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and
-763085383
narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire,
-989325807
feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
-1892204337

-1923438341
It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
731768217
tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot
2097981732
find it.  Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
-525320736
millions are in silent revolt against their lot.  Nobody knows how many
-122929085
rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
388850448
which people earth.  Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
-1438269493
women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and
662440083
a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from
118807477
too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would
-358605501
suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures
863510460
to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and
-615108550
knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.  It is
-87227636
thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or
1245489684
learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
978456536

-1923438341
When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
-1281692770
peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
-287156614
me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh.  There
482763517
were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
-318021074
not account for the sounds she made.  Sometimes I saw her: she would come
144504849
out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down
295073184
to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic reader,
926277236
forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter.  Her
-1405048227
appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral
99151406
oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest
43878923
could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but
1972785737
she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short
-1646505411
every effort of that sort.
342693715

-1923438341
The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
438213007
housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
632501114
respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
846854563
asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
751846372
descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused
994431625
answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
515044764

-1923438341
October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.
337297148
Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as
-1248883931
Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
696810389
occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
-1373372150
deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a
-1159267951
fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
67673100
library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
-1631244188
letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
404000453
and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
-852563884
pleasant winter afternoon walk.  Having seen Adele comfortably seated in
35021185
her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
-755887274
best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
1558988522
drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
431331977
having replied to her "Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
590423437
Jeannette," with a kiss I set out.
-938783032

-1923438341
The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast
935630277
till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
953674467
species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was
-1011235316
three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
1123298119
charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and
1125916084
pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild
-58464043
roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
-1293793115
possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter
-1490161073
delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of
777410228
air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an
695148260
evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as
-966090993
still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
-1453921106
Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now
485095834
browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the
453940351
hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
1404055995

-1923438341
This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle,
1968650102
I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.  Gathering my mantle
1499043208
about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold,
1633021577
though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the
897218843
causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a
1602949583
rapid thaw some days since.  From my seat I could look down on
1167060680
Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in
-1179978443
the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west.  I
1906767044
lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and
-83539132
clear behind them.  I then turned eastward.
-328411383

-1923438341
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
391360495
brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees,
351821027
sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant,
-807642254
but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
952545355
My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could
1975987352
not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks
-1428765667
threading their passes.  That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of
31667001
the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
702127099

-1923438341
A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
434336440
far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which
-1533571769
effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a
-2051054142
crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the
-1475139419
foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and
493799581
blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
-621743734

-1923438341
The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane
-836768750
yet hid it, but it approached.  I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the
321989063
path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.  In those days I was young,
-1001324207
and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories
712986110
of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they
1641134417
recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what
1350065547
childhood could give.  As this horse approached, and as I watched for it
-892217648
to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales,
-972898655
wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a "Gytrash," which, in
-1549102106
the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and
279240289
sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon
1823474453
me.
1968460902

-1923438341
It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
1267611945
tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems
-103671504
glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct
257425069
object against the trees.  It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a
581388391
lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however,
641239888
quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes,
529495065
in my face, as I half expected it would.  The horse followed,--a tall
1221056247
steed, and on its back a rider.  The man, the human being, broke the
338896235
spell at once.  Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and
1236723965
goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of
-550767908
beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.  No
1792719627
Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.  He
-346059507
passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an
-488230122
exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and a clattering tumble,
-461262237
arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the
-335600199
sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and
1658303747
seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked
1460387562
till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to
1194936806
his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up
132175657
to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to
2028749552
summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time
-598899273
struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I
-1873686265
thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--
484987113

-1923438341
"Are you injured, sir?"
707510492

-1923438341
I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing
349963261
some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.
-1397178865

-1923438341
"Can I do anything?" I asked again.
1456972782

-1923438341
"You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
578655659
knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,
-28330544
clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me
1843468712
effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away
434866496
till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was
3621452
re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!"  The
-650918402
traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they
1986385622
were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile
1995265388
whence I had just risen, and sat down.
-1642610550

-1923438341
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I
2122796726
now drew near him again.
-115095697

-1923438341
"If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
-782247414
Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
-1469381993

-1923438341
"Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;" and
434829807
again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
770377007
involuntary "Ugh!"
2085073588

-1923438341
Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
1538810172
could see him plainly.  His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
-1368781025
collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
1155535614
the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He
-4809789
had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
-1860233120
gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,
1258505819
but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt
2045472862
no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-
-1498164861
looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
-981746638
questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked.  I
-449112502
had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.  I
1639594935
had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry,
-619428924
fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape,
-545361351
I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have
-1199400604
sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would
-1065063462
fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
-1036534531

-1923438341
If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
-428084596
addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
-1954695980
thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
1480969766
inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
617785695
ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced--
-451886227

-1923438341
"I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary
-1565925407
lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
1970120727

-1923438341
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
448442957
direction before.
-803679676

-1923438341
"I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you have
-1392722155
a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
1942917762

-1923438341
"From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is
-1292230756
moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it:
-158276657
indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
1237724134

-1923438341
"You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
-695821449
pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
1979098233
bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
981683339
the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
-126626464

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Whose house is it?"
1548229520

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester's."
1582138303

-1923438341
"Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
-328808184

-1923438341
"No, I have never seen him."
-577965781

-1923438341
"He is not resident, then?"
1004545149

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Can you tell me where he is?"
1140571243

-1923438341
"I cannot."
-312985995

-1923438341
"You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--"  He stopped,
-2078562819
ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
-243839824
merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for
1481596032
a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.
1565480254

-1923438341
"I am the governess."
594674345

-1923438341
"Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!
362639513
The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes
314043982
he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.
343010089

-1923438341
"I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me a
-265983287
little yourself, if you will be so kind."
393505979

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
566043097

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
307227757
afraid?"
-220752611

-1923438341
I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
-1428703916
do it, I was disposed to obey.  I put down my muff on the stile, and went
146798316
up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a
-1822461608
spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on
1286160510
effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling
-367572443
fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last
-811648861
he laughed.
-1598906304

-1923438341
{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}
1262854361

-1923438341
"I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all
-1455993517
you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to
-1304257825
come here."
1284584217

-1923438341
I came.  "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
2068367130
useful."  He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
362559832
some stress, limped to his horse.  Having once caught the bridle, he
738306339
mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
1534400636
made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
2028786591

-1923438341
"Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
224361471
my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
1512574876

-1923438341
I sought it and found it.
391273485

-1923438341
"Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as
395631550
you can."
562349219

-1923438341
A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
-328242770
bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
2044138141

-1923438341
   "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
1526138410
   The wild wind whirls away."
1540327566

-1923438341
I took up my muff and walked on.  The incident had occurred and was gone
976517475
for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
-1439187492
sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.  My
927402543
help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have
-217434559
done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an
-676337395
active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.  The new face,
-1225607113
too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it
-223930232
was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was
-1191303225
masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.  I had
283181462
it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the
-598576665
post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.  When
408035702
I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with
1759068950
an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a
1805743801
rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again
1325483293
apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up
-1015929712
still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft
-1070854917
of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;
-1858963127
and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,
-2032235548
traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it
-374178794
reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
1313483809

-1923438341
I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to
1275647003
return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
-893597699
staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
1181411383
Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
1164363241
was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip
-556579316
again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still
261145465
existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I
-590836079
was becoming incapable of appreciating.  What good it would have done me
743393727
at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling
904695838
life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for
1230576842
the calm amidst which I now repined!  Yes, just as much good as it would
-1468333473
do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to take a long
1196837434
walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances,
18190637
as it would be under his.
1910748061

-1923438341
I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
1270082943
forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
-1543927561
could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn
-1572123787
from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as
877956998
it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved
652867944
from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb
1467102162
seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had
1515166856
come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark
-1016330255
in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling
958942449
stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow
-1114423622
when I viewed them.  Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck
1535407304
in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-
-942937845
door, and went in.
185880930

-1923438341
The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
352862961
lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
-312153776
staircase.  This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-
-735241516
leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing
1124281358
on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and
-2017080905
polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.  It revealed, too, a
-1938170704
group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become
1088686703
aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to
-363953285
distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
2028847050

-1923438341
I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
1027989782
candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
1422571156
rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
-1637151766
white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like
1377268925
it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to
-941499975
me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he
-604646075
looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he
-884229704
had come.  I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to
388656117
get an account of this visitant.  Leah entered.
-538875497

-1923438341
"What dog is this?"
-73743549

-1923438341
"He came with master."
-1560962887

-1923438341
"With whom?"
-376579270

-1923438341
"With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived."
-1902094975

-1923438341
"Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
-152080487

-1923438341
"Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a
738563237
surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is
-2122198325
sprained."
-1664799711

-1923438341
"Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
1277239129

-1923438341
"Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
-555133782

-1923438341
"Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
1811332902

-1923438341
Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the
1858879693
news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.
-916747969
Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went
-1276412764
upstairs to take off my things.
2011053321

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XIII
-1228739131

-1923438341

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that
1724563770
night; nor did he rise soon next morning.  When he did come down, it was
-949430921
to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived,
-2118084735
and waiting to speak with him.
360827865

-1923438341
Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
-897714918
requisition as a reception-room for callers.  A fire was lit in an
-246441359
apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
-920807519
the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that
2066906006
Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
-339152812
echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;
1075938845
steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different
-3496034
keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a
-685683459
master: for my part, I liked it better.
126663691

-1923438341
Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
-2114520626
running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
1701139500
get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
-655151388
downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
-1321021645
where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
843656071
made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
259774015
Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
-1723057503
before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
1184004929
brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when
1883611430
his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little
-342827026
box in whose contents she had an interest.
330490063

-1923438341
"Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau
654205226
pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle
1917713469
de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas
859912126
une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car
-1479160102
c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
-646688986

-1923438341
I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
-987091
was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.  At dark I
1353801663
allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
1403397635
from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to
680294259
the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.  Left
-1907761689
alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
1890298329
twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
-1821961876
shrubs on the lawn.  I let down the curtain and went back to the
-872322641
fireside.
1840721760

-1923438341
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
2140609330
remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
1438829881
Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had
1439904155
been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts
-2040650492
that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
-1958605279

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
963835893
him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
-611509577
engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
2095580307

-1923438341
"When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
-50334415

-1923438341
"Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better
185914812
change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a
37583440
candle."
-429516608

-1923438341
"Is it necessary to change my frock?"
856484759

-1923438341
"Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
991965464
is here."
1383444404

-1923438341
This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to
-1973952661
my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by
-110752905
one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one
1953650193
of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too
-1882010469
fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
94745630

-1923438341
"You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax.  I had a single little pearl
1310275339
ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
1380860614
and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather
-1464141909
a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I
-163111090
let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade
-99519690
as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was
-1090551716
now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
1190315859

-1923438341
Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
927660276
basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt
249896054
near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
613202020
supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire
-1610983208
shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
-754058258
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
-1576418874
his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
-140047522
character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
-1977395339
his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no
711187022
mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
-1820627758
squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
2038868923
athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though
1982451011
neither tall nor graceful.
1604983669

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
-1460094312
myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never
-934286560
lifted his head as we approached.
-264221770

-1923438341
"Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,
1476352048
still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
913581578

-1923438341
"Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the forced
1380321848
stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to
-1843287087
express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?
-1002626597
At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
-1598610600

-1923438341
I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness
1068376289
would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
-1292557911
by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
1006728458
under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
1141455476
freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the
-262743790
proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.
-2094239296

-1923438341
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.
1745529968
Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and
1121697729
she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she
-1282202714
condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the
-1344513002
annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she
1438624568
commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
747074576

-1923438341
"Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got.  She
-2028696155
hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
-1581060575
arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went
635423975
to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
-531959059

-1923438341
"Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adele
332857031
might perhaps spill it."
1373871194

-1923438341
I did as requested.  As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the
-1335834544
moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
-917453834

-1923438341
"N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans
-1890763221
votre petit coffre?"
1076320067

-1923438341
"Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly.  "Did you expect a present, Miss
995505712
Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes that
566218669
I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
-1906676008

-1923438341
"I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally
1155584484
thought pleasant things."
-405066931

-1923438341
"Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?"
1552294157

-1923438341
"I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer
1284098477
worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
-1043295907
and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its
-507031924
nature."
1849367461

-1923438341
"Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a
1472433345
'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush."
-1445844926

-1923438341
"Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can
1788931690
prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
-2144551787
she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but
111813342
if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger,
-1688213593
and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
1551185335

-1923438341
"Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find
-1806572909
you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
-1201497861
talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
384642447

-1923438341
"Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
1630577637
meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress."
1929079180

-1923438341
"Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
1133462059

-1923438341
"Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
-1764132297
Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was
172840275
leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and
-987418477
ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.  We obeyed, as in duty
-1346379933
bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to
1828677260
amuse herself with Pilot.
685719480

-1923438341
"You have been resident in my house three months?"
-1998063282

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And you came from--?"
1728801404

-1923438341
"From Lowood school, in ---shire."
-935126114

-1923438341
"Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?"
83597503

-1923438341
"Eight years."
-357084767

-1923438341
"Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in
556320102
such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have
-1697310804
rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that
859137491
sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
1817051802
unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
1211746110
had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?"
-66465719

-1923438341
"I have none."
-1909852968

-1923438341
"Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
612105035

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
-334433241
that stile?"
-1856684404

-1923438341
"For whom, sir?"
713492324

-1923438341
"For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I
1086136928
break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the
1354015599
causeway?"
-283061089

-1923438341
I shook my head.  "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
-550896382
ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done.  "And not even in Hay
-1651602938
Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't
1307843929
think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their
-1068038795
revels more."
-2077086630

-1923438341
Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed
-816083549
wondering what sort of talk this was.
-129301961

-1923438341
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some
1429794447
sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
1864783402

-1923438341
"No; none that I ever saw."
181566207

-1923438341
"And your home?"
-1864484146

-1923438341
"I have none."
-1909852968

-1923438341
"Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
1732182269

-1923438341
"I have no brothers or sisters."
-854627605

-1923438341
"Who recommended you to come here?"
318205175

-1923438341
"I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
-337226883

-1923438341
"Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and I
-1676321524
am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre
-993524484
has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to
2140857635
Adele."
976158055

-1923438341
"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr. Rochester:
-818737341
"eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by
-986071030
felling my horse."
-137356027

-1923438341
"Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
-2043806650

-1923438341
"I have to thank her for this sprain."
1969673440

-1923438341
The widow looked bewildered.
1447492208

-1923438341
"Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
385940350

-1923438341
"No, sir."
1637178386

-1923438341
"Have you seen much society?"
-1866827047

-1923438341
"None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
-756317551
Thornfield."
-743283789

-1923438341
"Have you read much?"
1255286582

-1923438341
"Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
-1953552927
very learned."
386805329

-1923438341
"You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
100699106
religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
-1547561873
parson, is he not?"
-467008071

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses
1991184011
would worship their director."
-1920634274

-1923438341
"Oh, no."
500284215

-1923438341
"You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That
392040781
sounds blasphemous."
1755079547

-1923438341
"I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is
-1498475255
a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
1258335616
economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
-507164211
hardly sew."
1852601753

-1923438341
"That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
352506609
caught the drift of the dialogue.
-249070290

-1923438341
"And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
1757319460
Rochester.
-1598260364

-1923438341
"He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
-1995666080
department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long
1649720302
lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own
-698052620
inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go
-681436540
to bed."
447935323

-1923438341
"What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
-2285722

-1923438341
"About ten."
-1331740030

-1923438341
"And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
1661015202

-1923438341
I assented.
-1182097152

-1923438341
"Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
-2050037492
been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the
1765487576
features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And
-1050085288
now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?"
584079251

-1923438341
"A little."
-83007213

-1923438341
"Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean,
1924439120
if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
2127967332
and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
-364887821
inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
-2140104742
door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
-1325937090

-1923438341
I departed, obeying his directions.
2029009503

-1923438341
"Enough!" he called out in a few minutes.  "You play _a little_, I see;
-1736058520
like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but
-96202544
not well."
-1520166213

-1923438341
I closed the piano and returned.  Mr. Rochester continued--"Adele showed
1211802556
me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know
441779860
whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?"
1413619210

-1923438341
"No, indeed!" I interjected.
2085490635

-1923438341
"Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
217487190
for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are
1023866822
certain: I can recognise patchwork."
-2024065369

-1923438341
"Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
720042286

-1923438341
I brought the portfolio from the library.
-71514193

-1923438341
"Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.  Adele and
2102543088
Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
1932988357

-1923438341
"No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
2056596839
finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
-1343090943

-1923438341
He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid
-972887664
aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
1084518473

-1923438341
"Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
-685296530
them with Adele;--you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
-1971707985
questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
-1853712559
hand yours?"
-881256576

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and
2036673165
some thought."
-1947502763

-1923438341
"I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
-437273429
other occupation."
-385625247

-1923438341
"Where did you get your copies?"
1488497772

-1923438341
"Out of my head."
1254368014

-1923438341
"That head I see now on your shoulders?"
826676329

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
-509102777

-1923438341
"I should think it may have: I should hope--better."
1073981569

-1923438341
He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
-1411207451

-1923438341
While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
-1171748973
first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.  The subjects had,
1997446602
indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,
-390656145
before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would
-1100797997
not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale
1887950269
portrait of the thing I had conceived.
-970671553

-1923438341
These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low
-1879739976
and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
1055610472
so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
-683879833
was no land.  One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
1822301558
mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
-225495990
foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
-1419155007
with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
-2119764373
distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,
1614909726
a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only
-837572416
limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
1933738633

-1923438341
The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,
618096332
with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above
-1806081599
spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky
-1429998778
was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I
268865472
could combine.  The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments
177696126
below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark
1803861855
and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm
132076941
or by electric travail.  On the neck lay a pale reflection like
606375565
moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from
254209630
which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
371140170

-1923438341
The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky:
-1609534857
a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along
-1664337982
the horizon.  Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a
756091952
head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against
-960044450
it.  Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew
-1594694259
up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white
-1686580591
as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the
512502615
glassiness of despair, alone were visible.  Above the temples, amidst
-2021009232
wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and
-917218513
consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles
-397711926
of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was "the likeness of a kingly
-1375270106
crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which shape had none."
1781323017

-1923438341
"Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
-1851718815
presently.
2095751394

-1923438341
"I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was
1976841311
to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
-1231826167

-1923438341
"That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been
802733349
few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while
-1719550138
you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long
1384991207
each day?"
124446547

-1923438341
"I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them
-252566308
from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the
1536065465
midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
-16760947

-1923438341
"And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
-967849430

-1923438341
"Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
-1867252714
handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
382398002
powerless to realise."
-513466

-1923438341
"Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
470385454
probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
643281906
it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to
-1813832018
the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must
66872766
have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not
1772654037
at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what
-1837728483
meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind?
-1762125798
There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you
-1035712204
see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!"
-1664000630

-1923438341
I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
907179759
watch, he said abruptly--
-1833098228

-1923438341
"It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up
760941198
so long?  Take her to bed."
-1147041142

-1923438341
Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
1633707544
but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so
-827782833
much.
279194064

-1923438341
"I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the hand
-1882489479
towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished
-1264898988
to dismiss us.  Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio:
1147504662
we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
-618649395

-1923438341
"You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
-848819186
observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.
197197415

-1923438341
"Well, is he?"
-1505238905

-1923438341
"I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
-44675775

-1923438341
"True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to
-960265931
his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of
-1990949447
temper, allowance should be made."
270001128

-1923438341
"Why?"
-1873626783

-1923438341
"Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;
867512183
and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and
919787841
make his spirits unequal."
2139958125

-1923438341
"What about?"
1955144447

-1923438341
"Family troubles, for one thing."
-1670965849

-1923438341
"But he has no family."
722787632

-1923438341
"Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder
1026004711
brother a few years since."
1880645877

-1923438341
"His _elder_ brother?"
1273306735

-1923438341
"Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
-1751379298
the property; only about nine years."
1661875955

-1923438341
"Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as
-1369248790
to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
-1662669713

-1923438341
"Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings
1321451828
between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
-2076081659
and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was
1675658327
fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did
-1680180132
not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
553171537
that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
823669075
the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were
-1141735039
not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and
-1092956244
Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a
1795626553
painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise
-224347704
nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could
-723202911
not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he
-19932874
broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled
963431836
kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for
-1894248972
a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left
1452511912
him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place."
-7214808

-1923438341
"Why should he shun it?"
-1476792487

-1923438341
"Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
100981273

-1923438341
The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
1498943387
Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information
-1445639042
of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they
641091011
were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from
-68902784
conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the
1981386361
subject, which I did accordingly.
1938243486

CHAPTER XIV
296521160

-1923438341

-1923438341
For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the
-1063516634
mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,
8489839
gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed
637916964
to dine with him.  When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse
-1971036062
exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he
-1299473071
generally did not come back till late at night.
-705497660

-1923438341
During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his presence, and
547820284
all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in
1575376935
the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass
494806202
me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod
134756736
or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike
2081826715
affability.  His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I
-1163148519
had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on
1010542872
causes quite disconnected with me.
1372059111

-1923438341
One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in
1455051453
order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early,
1009669301
to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but
496206174
the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
-1744622535
Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and
928516685
Adele were to go downstairs.  I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,
-912416605
and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where
-2000562174
there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided
843520736
locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering
1568648854
whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some
-546456695
mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.  She was gratified: there
1775022394
it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
1537416612
She appeared to know it by instinct.
-1980015247

-1923438341
"Ma boite! ma boite!" exclaimed she, running towards it.
319082085

-1923438341
"Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine
-1771816112
daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it," said the
-106540769
deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the
1889099791
depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.  "And mind," he
163832114
continued, "don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process,
1355446885
or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be
-1849637274
conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?"
1154991931

-1923438341
Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she had already retired to a
1309319822
sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the
1430676352
lid.  Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery
1486621790
envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
1234616131

-1923438341
"Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!" and then remained absorbed in ecstatic
-892165045
contemplation.
-729581455

-1923438341
"Is Miss Eyre there?" now demanded the master, half rising from his seat
-1019607693
to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
1317893244

-1923438341
"Ah! well, come forward; be seated here."  He drew a chair near his own.
68004869
"I am not fond of the prattle of children," he continued; "for, old
-49621726
bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their
1567491368
lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening
-72481719
_tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre;
-1751244085
sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound
-1990925376
these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly
-163469589
affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind;
-1803938961
it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is
528809216
said to be thicker than water."
-920623367

-1923438341
He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived,
2119027005
knitting-basket in hand.
1088162065

-1923438341
"Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have
1453196598
forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting
-105309970
with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and
-2140106271
interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever
-260486071
performed."
882930761

-1923438341
Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her
-865704531
sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the
1660502908
waxen contents of her "boite;" pouring out, meantime, explanations and
1079723166
raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.
892016210

-1923438341
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester,
1167127725
"put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at
2041276280
liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a
204513101
little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you
598345942
without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no
-404786166
mind to do."
-1298113614

-1923438341
I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in
777384249
the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it
1734989453
seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.
-2139025288

-1923438341
We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been
-947994534
lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large
2146724964
fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample
33501986
before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the
955475387
subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each
371416760
pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
-425335068

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to
1701032731
what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
-139006329
There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine
-1211661198
or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,
1225090167
in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-
1961551507
indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he
-1364123800
looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling
-907852889
back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-
1035279597
hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,
-1729655215
and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths
-1209862439
sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that
721784598
feeling.
-1265743187

-1923438341
He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the
-1345760000
same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze
-1690733835
fastened on his physiognomy.
-132459404

-1923438341
"You examine me, Miss Eyre," said he: "do you think me handsome?"
-1613479083

-1923438341
I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by
2085346619
something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped
-2108895199
from my tongue before I was aware--"No, sir."
2055638826

-1923438341
"Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you
341460888
have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as
1285387557
you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the
1883364864
carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;
509295911
as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a
-1719725911
remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,
-381952438
which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?"
-1171267843

-1923438341
"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that
-1791765019
it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about
-2005548969
appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little
759172022
consequence, or something of that sort."
1925094487

-1923438341
"You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,
999149515
indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of
-1252296612
stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under
-590491131
my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have
47852092
all my limbs and all my features like any other man?"
-167423312

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed
-1526483379
repartee: it was only a blunder."
-1995018904

-1923438341
"Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:
489003862
does my forehead not please you?"
-40182712

-1923438341
He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his
-804667786
brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an
1527258789
abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
1284819647

-1923438341
"Now, ma'am, am I a fool?"
1443110150

-1923438341
"Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in
1502059012
return whether you are a philanthropist?"
-566359584

-1923438341
"There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat
1398512249
my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of
-1314590921
children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a
1535726286
general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;" and he pointed to the
-2079410636
prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which,
1254772417
fortunately for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a
750214424
marked breadth to the upper part of his head: "and, besides, I once had a
-673352361
kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a
1770982181
feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky;
-856666187
but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her
386143954
knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber
1190814865
ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one
1170907896
sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for
1141132608
me?"
1612507100

-1923438341
"Hope of what, sir?"
-626152771

-1923438341
"Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?"
-1637172968

-1923438341
"Decidedly he has had too much wine," I thought; and I did not know what
2114273115
answer to make to his queer question: how could I tell whether he was
-1249507835
capable of being re-transformed?
-1974722723

-1923438341
"You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty
1993351665
any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it
-1553847658
is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my
-349557629
physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so
20577513
puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative
1291524331
to-night."
-1952948619

-1923438341
With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm
240560790
on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as
-1537366182
well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost
706037127
to his length of limb.  I am sure most people would have thought him an
1822470145
ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much
1897846137
ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own
1332902087
external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other
1299716885
qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere
-288318842
personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared
-510891500
the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the
-2095900206
confidence.
42567894

-1923438341
"I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night," he repeated,
1112290595
"and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not
1658131
sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these
370288322
can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs.
1350609613
Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled
-1147078172
me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten
-1014298264
you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am
-802196994
resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what
984835568
pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of
-899612934
you--therefore speak."
1079728990

-1923438341
Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive
1545285030
smile either.
1092426301

-1923438341
"Speak," he urged.
-1682567895

-1923438341
"What about, sir?"
-1752867247

-1923438341
"Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of
687343374
treating it entirely to yourself."
758296822

-1923438341
Accordingly I sat and said nothing: "If he expects me to talk for the
494235128
mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed
-929925323
himself to the wrong person," I thought.
1292274271

-1923438341
"You are dumb, Miss Eyre."
-1558689872

-1923438341
I was dumb still.  He bent his head a little towards me, and with a
-269635948
single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
-1637530920

-1923438341
"Stubborn?" he said, "and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my
-1557668988
request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your
1502273124
pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an
738218749
inferior: that is" (correcting himself), "I claim only such superiority
-930139269
as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's
1691321234
advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele
-161802467
would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that
1153421719
I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert
-409325113
my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a
1803117236
rusty nail."
818305969

-1923438341
He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel
-978744412
insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.
-1016583295

-1923438341
"I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot
1947059868
introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me
-1183569310
questions, and I will do my best to answer them."
446823778

-1923438341
"Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be
-1510791886
a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I
1696500496
stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have
1654247690
battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and
-369937812
roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of
1331175611
people in one house?"
-1816615084

-1923438341
"Do as you please, sir."
-132596250

-1923438341
"That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very
1862673102
evasive one.  Reply clearly."
-43513379

-1923438341
"I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you
-609666034
are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have;
2020622512
your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time
-1161823821
and experience."
450413931

-1923438341
"Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would
2007428565
never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use
1032828274
of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you
639916829
must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued
112662988
or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?"
-91066844

-1923438341
I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to
-1499487738
forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.
-873258944

-1923438341
"The smile is very well," said he, catching instantly the passing
1431553710
expression; "but speak too."
464385369

-1923438341
"I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to
1569217014
inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by
-406552507
their orders."
-1483371613

-1923438341
"Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,
-809085527
I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will
-1882844376
you agree to let me hector a little?"
-1898867006

-1923438341
"No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,
-1125353917
and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his
-624654583
dependency, I agree heartily."
2075036994

-1923438341
"And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms
364793546
and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?"
1990730905

-1923438341
"I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I
-1572156981
rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a
-211159004
salary."
-1029424855

-1923438341
"Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;
1787987329
therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which
1348962090
you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for
-26784622
your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which
1253875634
it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and
-448864336
sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,
931201514
affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of
25497515
one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three
-419393088
thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have
1260860200
just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a
462565599
different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
-321107058
And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet
-1591699199
know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable
-2136571592
defects to counterbalance your few good points."
-742665477

-1923438341
"And so may you," I thought.  My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind:
430792923
he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken
161902037
as well as imagined--
576655503

-1923438341
"Yes, yes, you are right," said he; "I have plenty of faults of my own: I
-1684332128
know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need
2073713409
not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of
1685291555
deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might
462277953
well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I
-243799333
started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the
2112320690
blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong
-1579579022
tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right
1564602787
course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as
-1715661894
good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind,
-1919218699
your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory
-1033609587
without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an
380786819
inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?"
280873786

-1923438341
"How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?"
-321569201

-1923438341
"All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it
1901781799
to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature
748734610
meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better
992240058
kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least
1355815655
I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you
1196345756
express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then
-380346329
take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not
1641787043
to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe,
-314483538
rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace
-1550180460
sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich
-1331147857
and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
-1946010604
Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself
-787045755
elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people
879027575
will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to
559673047
tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they
1434778951
will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their
-1891958985
indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting
741087938
and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations."
1970082942

-1923438341
"How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?"
588006391

-1923438341
"I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were
-818245262
writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been
-879797130
superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was
1627425869
not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned
-351655493
desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites
540720233
my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am
1504420613
better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I
127565272
wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are
-54638831
tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life."
-1864007757

-1923438341
"Repentance is said to be its cure, sir."
1118374101

-1923438341
"It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I
1117429443
have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it,
592529662
hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is
-471827836
irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I
761930173
_will_ get it, cost what it may."
-1284893160

-1923438341
"Then you will degenerate still more, sir."
1694976422

-1923438341
"Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I
-713789235
may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the
862254676
moor."
-1170774153

-1923438341
"It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir."
1761453948

-1923438341
"How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn
46693139
you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head"
-1676996041
(taking one from the mantelpiece).  "You have no right to preach to me,
39611738
you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely
1189095272
unacquainted with its mysteries."
-765747905

-1923438341
"I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought
-1830987561
remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence."
-391017474

-1923438341
"And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered
-1401474230
across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather
-312146075
than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here
119438890
it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on
-1741157751
the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest
758109946
when it asks entrance to my heart."
315427743

-1923438341
"Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel."
-833468464

-1923438341
"Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to
-1016985214
distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the
-280874559
eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?"
-1585917179

-1923438341
"I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the
-1387195193
suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more
-2097427452
misery if you listen to it."
1143360918

-1923438341
"Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the
801375930
rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy.
751510724
Here, come in, bonny wanderer!"
-1473958589

-1923438341
He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own;
1064515947
then, folding his arms, which he had half extended, on his chest, he
-638678837
seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.
1670545546

-1923438341
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a
1232630487
disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my
-2126341118
heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine."
578757270

-1923438341
"To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the
-2035758535
conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I
594651001
know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that
-358187177
you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you
-261498276
intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems
-210932124
to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to
1989213719
become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you
-1050338619
began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in
-1976653421
a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to
-839652595
which you might revert with pleasure."
1972704415

-1923438341
"Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am
-260147223
paving hell with energy."
-547122767

-1923438341
"Sir?"
-1350564325

-1923438341
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
-1605590297
Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have
-1415617936
been."
-1337338401

-1923438341
"And better?"
-1765492458

-1923438341
"And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to
265697818
doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives
1980424308
are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes
528989140
and Persians, that both are right."
-1703761867

-1923438341
"They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them."
-1193029578

-1923438341
"They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute:
-768669059
unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules."
2062100581

-1923438341
"That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it
-727880207
is liable to abuse."
-625336926

-1923438341
"Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to
-458854172
abuse it."
-900751782

-1923438341
"You are human and fallible."
-658209872

-1923438341
"I am: so are you--what then?"
-1065607947

-1923438341
"The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine
-1248344281
and perfect alone can be safely intrusted."
-1092657019

-1923438341
"What power?"
-1929443874

-1923438341
"That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be
1039754978
right.'"
183210490

-1923438341
"'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them."
48359979

-1923438341
"_May_ it be right then," I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to
1912101396
continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible
1895889386
that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at
2117985974
least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague
-246976917
sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.
-636104221

-1923438341
"Where are you going?"
-1883104794

-1923438341
"To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime."
-552628329

-1923438341
"You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx."
-277281654

-1923438341
"Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am
175371710
certainly not afraid."
-1507682909

-1923438341
"You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder."
2034633163

-1923438341
"In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense."
-2035106930

-1923438341
"If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake
-1068684399
it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to
1595321684
answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe
1653368895
me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
1863639962
The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your
-1074181852
features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear
-1512801362
in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you
1345676374
will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in
-1292925529
time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it
-1107369006
impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements
478846484
will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at
1708157536
intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars
879467283
of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but
1420488427
free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?"
-1907990740

-1923438341
"It has struck nine, sir."
-663821991

-1923438341
"Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My
1290607487
position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room,
-2092502904
favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally
1890448758
watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious
581459180
study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).
-961463583
She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk
1622202253
frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her
-1002282698
blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il
914811093
faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed
1909147233
out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in
-1774336240
a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a
-197062635
miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the
57629821
rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about
566521331
to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it
-1806349705
will be realised."
-87230384

-1923438341
Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She
-1594363820
entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of
1111167335
rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be
584543830
gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of
-1356969038
rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings
-1310439775
and small white satin sandals.
1148455107

-1923438341
"Est-ce que ma robe va bien?" cried she, bounding forwards; "et mes
-1013928660
souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!"
654624579

-1923438341
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having
-1461223944
reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe,
-1236934
then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
-331552486

-1923438341
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she
1837427271
added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
-860629102

-1923438341
"Pre-cise-ly!" was the answer; "and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English
-2145946069
gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss
1463149898
Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once
-1759601445
freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French
-93361073
floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not
-626026465
valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort
-1416679164
which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the
1314078201
blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it
-775947155
and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous
-345377697
sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day.
-1961675735
Good-night."
17574960

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XV
-365553386

-1923438341

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one
1685109022
afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while
623358574
she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and
-2058616207
down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
-1617749257

-1923438341
He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine
158975282
Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
2024588120
passion_."  This passion Celine had professed to return with even
-1261567931
superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
163871447
believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlete_" to the
216084781
elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
1908484531

-1923438341
"And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic
-1056024274
sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a
1724367879
complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,
766912672
dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the
477649477
received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the
-1257437314
originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode
2016411218
the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the
-1524896031
beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other
-567418911
spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I
-1782411894
found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling
1885616015
through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air
-1586574842
consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never
1301380481
thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort
1123208564
of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an
-846465928
odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of
-1925233390
conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to
-549565407
open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and
-21619676
gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished
-1201377238
with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one
1147584131
now, if you will excuse me."
1463952079

-1923438341
Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar;
600748097
having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on
-538627363
the freezing and sunless air, he went on--
-1361902175

-1923438341
"I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
-459750562
_croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
-557234095
smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
-1811153337
the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an
-1194738406
elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and
-533951995
distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I
1653224678
had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with
-1059689622
impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as
-1282627534
I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an
2144080624
opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary
32867599
encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly
685524713
by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she
-1125183119
skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to
-1692229138
murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the
-1357559311
ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her;
-347442718
cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement,
771150595
and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte
-119591328
cochere_ of the hotel.
-1724723961

-1923438341
"You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not
-1362980898
ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to
1429446832
experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
2136691831
waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
136888953
which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes
-1963540227
and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the
-46255624
bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell
-2102952440
you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass
-887780253
in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into
425028502
whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on
-1114311742
crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer
-213639721
current--as I am now.
-1222770411

-1923438341
"I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
-1000137096
stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its
90787542
antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
-809202920
facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
1614647419
how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great
1142635849
plague-house?  How I do still abhor--"
-1013311888

-1923438341
He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
1503968627
boot against the hard ground.  Some hated thought seemed to have him in
-1949722262
its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
-1628161517

-1923438341
We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us.
-2147266223
Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I
341197203
never saw before or since.  Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
360705420
detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large
-1674090719
pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow.  Wild was the wrestle which should
1954648456
be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and
-1539104402
cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified
-136473920
his countenance: he went on--
-229252133

-1923438341
"During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with
-1250665557
my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of
992144188
those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like
-2011486582
Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air
-458617016
a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front,
742236025
between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it
1534318269
if you dare!'
1815957673

-1923438341
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily)
1314645027
"I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
-1796548598
goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been,
333990999
than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
-1363499710
habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem
493205635
but straw and rotten wood."
549680921

-1923438341
Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock.  "Away!" he cried
100033971
harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!"  Continuing
-1110620796
then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point
-1945813240
whence he had abruptly diverged--
1057004594

-1923438341
"Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens entered?"
162542793

-1923438341
I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
-783907301
the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes
222188618
towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  "Oh, I had
-305820451
forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in
-989301217
accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
-215917459
of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided
1161086099
within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
694999698
Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point.  "Strange
1382273478
that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady;
-265337153
passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the
-1097905803
most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his
-1356889324
opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last
1698517234
singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with
782411871
your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient
965280033
of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in
-1043025596
communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection:
421712940
it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm
-900960257
it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I
565627288
converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me."
1026259939
After this digression he proceeded--
-1973054604

-1923438341
"I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
1614582891
thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the
684199058
open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through
-1377304372
which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a
-442828689
chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows:
-1989018800
then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My
1288150153
eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a
-999861687
lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed
-2000019206
to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,'
-1112094644
shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her
-1926896708
companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a
1464752843
vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in
-40260073
society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so
-1314195037
absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was
-660196405
instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank
338238996
under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was
-653519783
not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I,
631594944
who had been her dupe.
-509139957

-1923438341
"They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
-906704513
mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
-89640404
than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being
-734180751
perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed
-1241122908
energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as
1720203256
they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather
-1903881544
brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it
1534943125
had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she
-1222610059
called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,
-725096214
who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think
-713551235
me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--"
1332445599

-1923438341
Adele here came running up again.
1394364120

-1923438341
"Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
-1970622433
wishes to see you."
-992336954

-1923438341
"Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon
1904686052
them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her
-1652933139
hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams,
462419900
hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with
-45087830
the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had
-464676756
the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor
1046529581
etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then
2006535041
thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six
1988954378
months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my
-1350394518
daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim
2082575649
paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.
1947585139
Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,
769740045
and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no
1637251810
natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now
-679455542
acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite
-1917163425
destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris,
1908486873
and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an
1046153065
English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you
-68786616
know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you
-133708424
will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be
-536446379
coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that
-616710799
you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?"
734124575

-1923438341
"No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
-1408454674
have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
-797862218
parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall
-1473066309
cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
84090330
pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a
567861477
lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
-1141642161

-1923438341
"Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and
1621122269
you too: it darkens."
-641095567

-1923438341
But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race
-1670972390
with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went
2024561479
in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
1495183564
her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
635742874
even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
255641388
stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
-2064112077
character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
-2043689822
English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate
153141331
all that was good in her to the utmost.  I sought in her countenance and
1363817232
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn
-4214105
of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but
-1668697121
have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.
-889420274

-1923438341
It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
457277463
that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had
2010434500
said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of
-948209066
the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,
-824345125
and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in
1727902127
society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of
-241069614
emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of
790468270
expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived
-654728152
pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on
-221300017
this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present
1140950788
inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to
-1244497673
myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a
-1779874615
tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.  His
-2094532075
deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at
-943908150
the first.  I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling
-51742208
hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he
-1057266762
had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal
-826135015
invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception
-1187336538
that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that
1318220919
these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my
-1635221485
benefit.
745659255

-1923438341
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish.
-615142109
It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind
841382099
unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not
495259156
mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
1020604991
interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
-2076115126
novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
-171951258
receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
1718798214
portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
-782824466
disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
915127199

-1923438341
The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
-2054923780
frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
-1597739337
him.  I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
-912113276
yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
-917732184
was his way.  So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
-1075185362
added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
-1820492703
crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
-469214781
up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
423280229

-1923438341
And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and
-1813819809
many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I
-1596271070
best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
-410079151
brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,
-1198206461
for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh
-395773368
to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his
-659155880
great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He
-477026184
was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read
-385049395
to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his
1059818513
folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl
1877137613
blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his
158989832
harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he
564503981
seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I
-1490297178
believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles,
-995646591
and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education
-1708573378
instilled, or destiny encouraged.  I thought there were excellent
-1428360063
materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat
-1687483378
spoiled and tangled.  I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,
2020371913
whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
-108901105

-1923438341
Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could
-1047342562
not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told
-1567768778
how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at
887853830
Thornfield.
1261304349

-1923438341
"Why not?" I asked myself.  "What alienates him from the house?  Will he
-73664606
leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than
-1605553047
a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he
-1113822707
does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,
1193444372
summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!"
1254585290

-1923438341
I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate,
-449789834
I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious,
1974114689
which sounded, I thought, just above me.  I wished I had kept my candle
803730535
burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.  I rose
1531521024
and sat up in bed, listening.  The sound was hushed.
1728083720

-1923438341
I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
89311797
tranquillity was broken.  The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
-803648687
Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept
-237393083
the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.  I said, "Who
1136600521
is there?"  Nothing answered.  I was chilled with fear.
1978447719

-1923438341
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-
-81976468
door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the
1905216307
threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself
1566218630
in the mornings.  The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.  Silence
1757534067
composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through
-493188968
the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.  But it was not
1506972775
fated that I should sleep that night.  A dream had scarcely approached my
877811956
ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident
1185371746
enough.
-1642386057

-1923438341
This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it
572126173
seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door.  The head of my bed was
-1576049273
near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
1365510216
bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
-1659947401
could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
647961482
reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.  My first impulse
-201098028
was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
-2096378749
there?"
-1765695468

-1923438341
Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
342517967
towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
-474951275
in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
911099989

-1923438341
"Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
882112711
Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I
-564512159
hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door
-831402207
with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on
246769605
the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but
-1862191946
still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with
-1102651915
smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence
681808121
these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of
1390336106
burning.
1012831310

-1923438341
Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's,
-1153422508
and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.  I thought no more of Mrs.
885306865
Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I
258711278
was within the chamber.  Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the
950576496
curtains were on fire.  In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester
1815092763
lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
-640694093

-1923438341
"Wake! wake!" I cried.  I shook him, but he only murmured and turned: the
1517911295
smoke had stupefied him.  Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets
-1831839853
were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide
572056394
and the other deep, and both were filled with water.  I heaved them up,
-52660829
deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my
160390051
own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in
-1815802146
extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
-748762384

-1923438341
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung
98882717
from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the
1382426564
shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
842999756
Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
1404037191
fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
-1466053762
water.
850824084

-1923438341
"Is there a flood?" he cried.
1191573

-1923438341
"No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
504898164
quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
7123846

-1923438341
"In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
809529239
demanded.  "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the
541736423
room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?"
832005648

-1923438341
"I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody
1625165198
has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is."
-289869242

-1923438341
"There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
2145530894
minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here
1350737106
is my dressing-gown.  Now run!"
-1746248419

-1923438341
I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.  He
-577345706
took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and
972869131
scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
-1150896131

-1923438341
"What is it? and who did it?" he asked.  I briefly related to him what
-1350205492
had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step
1055648466
ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had
1027918736
conducted me to his room; in what state I had found matters there, and
208253236
how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.
2110090766

-1923438341
{"What is it and who did it?" he asked: p140.jpg}
-1800835077

-1923438341
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern
1169423013
than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
1708716589

-1923438341
"Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
547624028

-1923438341
"Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she
-1192021593
do?  Let her sleep unmolested."
1487751279

-1923438341
"Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
-2083339099

-1923438341
"Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm
-1229105235
enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in
-914761279
the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the
1912660704
stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few
1246227127
minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return;
1434477449
be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't
-77399926
move, remember, or call any one."
621876448

-1923438341
He went: I watched the light withdraw.  He passed up the gallery very
-653476379
softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
1289782299
shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total
-1069607550
darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long
-227076835
time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then
-1231384973
I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was
-1014911422
on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his
318918257
orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I
-787430494
heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  "I hope it is he," thought I,
-805196597
"and not something worse."
-267875820

-1923438341
He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  "I have found it all out," said he,
-759826839
setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
1242021520

-1923438341
"How, sir?"
2098687172

-1923438341
He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.
1395647128
At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--
639405361

-1923438341
"I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber
309208384
door."
295089989

-1923438341
"No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
1196713633

-1923438341
"But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should
-90124479
think, or something like it?"
860500693

-1923438341
"Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she
-1968261518
laughs in that way.  She is a singular person."
1239206910

-1923438341
"Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,
-1322977928
singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am
661249213
glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
2132945952
precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say
1451415072
nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing to
597596573
the bed): "and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the
2109727392
sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two
792277698
hours the servants will be up."
985827188

-1923438341
"Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
1561906496

-1923438341
He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
1028484826
go.
-277538192

-1923438341
"What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
-1466562674

-1923438341
"You said I might go, sir."
-727408970

-1923438341
"But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
-185914508
acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
-2043863146
Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and
-668837171
excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers!
820003538
At least shake hands."
1963256057

-1923438341
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in
-2055195771
both his own.
-1126785421

-1923438341
"You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
-2006933838
debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been
1943781517
tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but
-320342426
you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
-1458018146

-1923438341
He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,--but
-1866833558
his voice was checked.
-2073969905

-1923438341
"Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
1151627109
in the case."
1754545555

-1923438341
"I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
308463678
time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
2127883625
and smile did not"--(again he stopped)--"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
1665972879
"strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of
-1000376536
natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth
-1758129083
in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!"
929050426

-1923438341
Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
1702345652

-1923438341
"I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
-1230428240

-1923438341
"What! you _will_ go?"
641554961

-1923438341
"I am cold, sir."
-554952952

-1923438341
"Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!"  But he still
-1612845093
retained my hand, and I could not free it.  I bethought myself of an
-1889215966
expedient.
-2094606194

-1923438341
"I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
418227249

-1923438341
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
296765268

-1923438341
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.  Till morning dawned I
490404973
was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled
1442654567
under surges of joy.  I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a
-215623985
shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale,
375185799
wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I
-1933311216
could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land,
269234114
and continually drove me back.  Sense would resist delirium: judgment
-606736176
would warn passion.  Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
1914003944

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XVI
1259740764

-1923438341

-1923438341
I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
137947907
this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
-1723003069
meet his eye.  During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
436932533
expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
-316078599
schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the
-562678895
impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
618652309

-1923438341
But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
1793462435
quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some
-42092315
bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's
566992846
voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's
735233312
own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not
-700129965
burnt in his bed!"  "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at
-588815493
night."  "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the
-1938295212
water-jug!"  "I wonder he waked nobody!"  "It is to be hoped he will not
232399316
take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
-1443153654

-1923438341
To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
-605460859
rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw
-131775531
through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only
412346541
the bed was stripped of its hangings.  Leah stood up in the window-seat,
745085846
rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address
-1453160257
her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,
1138052575
on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a
-502587430
chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was
-1243149764
no other than Grace Poole.
-366232548

-1923438341
There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
292681706
gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on
-1415563407
her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
1891291367
forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
1195659198
paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
1991663442
countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
-2066653790
victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
-562894084
charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate.  I was
-1616566281
amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
171940107
no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
-810200162
guilt, or fear of detection.  She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual
486132223
phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,
517959591
went on with her sewing.
-1750908267

-1923438341
"I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute impenetrability
1235655804
is past comprehension."
-1208570115

-1923438341
"Good morning, Grace," I said.  "Has anything happened here?  I thought I
1453253101
heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
1211627996

-1923438341
"Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with
-949724146
his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke
-1001399093
before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench
-113337796
the flames with the water in the ewer."
43880201

-1923438341
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
1684324321
fixedly--"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?"
-1158113735

-1923438341
She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
-1513848316
consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then
1267251296
she answered--
1973505078

-1923438341
"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely
1412634281
to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but
1912756557
Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often
-1076972931
sleep heavy."  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed
-849375106
indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--"But you are
-1853106503
young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard
492815013
a noise?"
14124563

-1923438341
"I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing
-917965970
the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was Pilot: but
-1059944621
Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one."
-1569858487

-1923438341
She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
1243924779
needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
1712562162

-1923438341
"It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
-1967497380
was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
1575355233

-1923438341
"I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
1083490318
provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
1959437694
conscious eye.
-505234805

-1923438341
"Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
-884984324

-1923438341
"I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
-473710826

-1923438341
"You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
221849994
gallery?" she further asked.
-358510618

-1923438341
She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
-566592635
information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
-2087367384
or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
485052682
pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
-907151643

-1923438341
"On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
1340328731

-1923438341
"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
-777642546
you get into bed?"
-2143906467

-1923438341
"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
960610761
accordingly!"  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
-659521123
sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
1563969334
think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
-2133623013
dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
-2037036399
the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to
1476101013
lie down."
2117684412

-1923438341
"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
1277309125
quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
685568143
robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth
-1151908668
of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a
2035033432
large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived
644129952
here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little
845719913
waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is
-108348144
soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any
970373058
mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all
-2015426067
to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,
-87815610
though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly."  And here
1840984559
she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the
1776280556
demureness of a Quakeress.
1540039415

-1923438341
I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
787365237
miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook
2088860031
entered.
595227115

-1923438341
"Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will soon
1820922579
be ready: will you come down?"
792166033

-1923438341
"No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
1037823206
carry it upstairs."
-780262819

-1923438341
"You'll have some meat?"
113245021

-1923438341
"Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
-531948668

-1923438341
"And the sago?"
-1006316797

-1923438341
"Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
57725015
make it myself."
1361372595

-1923438341
The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me:
-1568205524
so I departed.
587506068

-1923438341
I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during
1090964890
dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical
-1804592264
character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her
-124785217
position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into
366044065
custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her master's
-1252122742
service.  He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her
-1214270728
criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing
-849044166
her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,
-498546226
vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of
92957317
the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she
-286226335
lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the
1641419800
attempt, much less punish her for it.
-2110734226

-1923438341
Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
905747966
that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in
-536167019
her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could
904872426
not be admitted.  "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth
-1783266375
would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she
-326194804
had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;
91784953
but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of
-1547094914
character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.
1940530412
Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric
891452444
at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so
-62622708
sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she
-1791102310
now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own
-64986278
indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?"  But,
-369857859
having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat
1941107854
figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my
-1781307909
mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be
-2123233406
correct.  Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own
-1803364231
hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves
736649608
you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last
1931028320
night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"
-1208422256

-1923438341
I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
-1523887669
vividly renewed.  I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent
-1615333641
over her and directed her pencil.  She looked up with a sort of start.
-1976307346

-1923438341
"Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.  "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
207651972
feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
-1529062546

-1923438341
"I am hot, Adele, with stooping!"  She went on sketching; I went on
1771640534
thinking.
-651015124

-1923438341
I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving
-293554370
respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me.  I compared myself with her, and
-1604175386
found we were different.  Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and
1128457712
she spoke truth--I was a lady.  And now I looked much better than I did
459936379
when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more
-383788375
vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
-356610795

-1923438341
"Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window.  "I have
-388904680
never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely
-2050735873
I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I
2075158291
desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown
-2138102075
impatient."
-63788157

-1923438341
When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the
-682093658
nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the
-1466788631
bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
-487640810
fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the
1778136908
door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;
-978940198
darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he
-2005672540
often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
-1847241893
Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
-1853348719
things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
1178630578
Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
1982002154
he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;
1499340803
and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered
568329067
whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and
-1528811207
soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure
1271664029
instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of
-1948246518
provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my
1947057250
skill.  Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my
-697618922
station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy
1115847747
restraint; this suited both him and me.
1198928258

-1923438341
A tread creaked on the stairs at last.  Leah made her appearance; but it
719184517
was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  Thither
-566907274
I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
-1602009933
imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
1626922345

-1923438341
"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
249784858
so little at dinner.  I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-
-644297441
day: you look flushed and feverish."
-1860113075

-1923438341
"Oh, quite well!  I never felt better."
95647185

-1923438341
"Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
-1828641077
teapot while I knit off this needle?"  Having completed her task, she
2101178187
rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
-502270640
suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
1817163071
deepening into total obscurity.
2114177228

-1923438341
"It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes, "though
-1145959027
not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for
-2024679764
his journey."
893457992

-1923438341
"Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out."
1193377489

-1923438341
"Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,
-1229146104
Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe
1860730552
there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
1227564272
Colonel Dent, and others."
643621555

-1923438341
"Do you expect him back to-night?"
760019589

-1923438341
"No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
-804329770
week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are
-131687616
so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can
1766810071
please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen
618883402
especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is
1130430920
so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general
-918446637
favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think
1216553717
his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:
967169485
but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good
-1238244170
blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
-833318741

-1923438341
"Are there ladies at the Leas?"
-517093818

-1923438341
"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies
542875063
indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most
-1763879311
beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven
-120287059
years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a
860093168
Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the
46315928
dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
383183743
up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of
-396798996
the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
914679076
the evening."
-1703682865

-1923438341
"You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
1980216649

-1923438341
"Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
433166237
Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
-486428651
hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to
-110072527
come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw
947982870
a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
758185513
them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
-179194787
was certainly the queen."
633675855

-1923438341
"And what was she like?"
-860909353

-1923438341
"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
-411999926
complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
763125269
Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then
-467884379
she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:
1715296595
a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest
-1361683258
curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf
-603533484
was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and
751055683
descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an
-1891539246
amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the
-2089745657
jetty mass of her curls."
-1105377229

-1923438341
"She was greatly admired, of course?"
331276057

-1923438341
"Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
-1183152754
She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
-1211811341
piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
1522902134

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing."
1196087605

-1923438341
"Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
-708129839

-1923438341
"And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
-2109352226

-1923438341
"A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
-119753664
listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but
-1857932299
Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good."
1781292319

-1923438341
"And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
-951122926

-1923438341
"It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
-1051724348
fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
1631720754
eldest son came in for everything almost."
1256282062

-1923438341
"But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:
-1698738463
Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?"
1665062268

-1923438341
"Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
-562057468
Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
1377923164

-1923438341
"What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day."
-1877386426

-1923438341
"True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea
-1486024320
of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you
1408187330
began tea."
551121634

-1923438341
"No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?"
1848077456

-1923438341
I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
156082224
Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the
1638903806
conversation was turned into another channel.
-732372508

-1923438341
When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
-469378570
my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
-1189304790
back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
1049514066
boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
-2106168590

-1923438341
Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
677705028
wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general
111662354
state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason
1990833809
having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished
-1443711723
tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the
-1610550306
ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:--
485746633

-1923438341
That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life;
-1003500487
that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies,
-367892876
and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
-2112632085

-1923438341
"_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the
-708191439
power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your
-297463141
folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
27544262
of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
671564539
of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid
-324588632
dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
2091238666
yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and
-96411377
be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind
-2129558873
puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
-786321708
senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,
1191646283
who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women
1586764522
to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and
-829443476
unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
449559465
responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there
1643082984
is no extrication.
148888500

-1923438341
"Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
-1471839279
before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
494722269
softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
59031741
irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
1966015762
poor, and plain.'
-2075124864

-1923438341
"Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your
-176694101
drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
-664049055
tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully
-2014003907
the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and
1353046179
sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of
1871596796
Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you
-784015001
revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no
1985937028
regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet
-1665897835
harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and
-1584105598
dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring
1646272665
nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and
-1582878221
glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an
-1510459989
accomplished lady of rank.'
-1063731758

-1923438341
"Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
1585088131
well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
1471785776
Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
619407610
strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
-1454683892
indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
587478779

-1923438341
"I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
1292778067
calm, and fell asleep.
1339874522

-1923438341
I kept my word.  An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
1401033250
crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature
443666008
of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when
630937445
compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-
-258673227
control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my
-452647384
head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new
-1528005348
impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
313405267

-1923438341
Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome
1121531291
discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to
1327536664
it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,
721537048
had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to
-517561373
maintain, even externally.
740374601

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XVII
200124434

-1923438341

-1923438341
A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still
-1147062455
he did not come.  Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he
-1041585269
were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent,
-1160368667
and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not
-1398468234
unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.  When
695012014
I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the
-1582274682
heart.  I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense
-345523914
of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,
260342381
I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got
-898711543
over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.
1454397590
Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital
1265229250
interest.  Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority:
-852515949
on the contrary, I just said--
215532061

-1923438341
"You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to
-1848597945
receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be
1740016401
grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty,
-1368755086
you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he
-1559841046
seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object
536260269
of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not
-1062026422
of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish
159676457
the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not
-949995998
wanted and would be despised."
-513455632

-1923438341
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague
-1592610450
suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit
-1156000654
Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering
1909603893
conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to
946978750
check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
-1589890710

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post
-116966986
brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.
1616899069

-1923438341
"It is from the master," said she, as she looked at the direction.  "Now
1756257962
I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not."
1542784766

-1923438341
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking
953002631
my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that
640255046
circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.  Why my hand
235647904
shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my
-97215302
saucer, I did not choose to consider.
-1627447546

-1923438341
"Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being
-816010141
busy enough now: for a little while at least," said Mrs. Fairfax, still
-1708783444
holding the note before her spectacles.
-129540487

-1923438341
Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of
-581865295
Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to
-1423660596
another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly--
-1280239072

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?"
1720684475

-1923438341
"Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and
1802604521
not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas
1898451841
are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be
-902827899
prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am
-55553723
to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from
1547873309
wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the
991662114
gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it."  And Mrs.
1060122462
Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.
-1720282974

-1923438341
The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough.  I had thought all
1529230872
the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it
659732622
appears I was mistaken.  Three women were got to help; and such
-1812147815
scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,
-192765226
such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors
310608916
and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets
571307661
and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
1554401597
Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and
-2043012009
the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.  She
-1474483631
would have Sophie to look over all her "toilettes," as she called frocks;
993383222
to furbish up any that were "_passees_," and to air and arrange the new.
-1105275920
For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump
1898991120
on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters
2144711618
and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.  From
-1300724110
school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her
-900786982
service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her
-1430454104
and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French
-482438623
pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
-928790981

-1923438341
The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for
754266708
dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse
1210241210
chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele
-886517542
excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my
1060619579
cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of
1122250842
doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to
68417063
see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept
247930999
locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim
293845017
cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the
564073535
gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look
1450539922
into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to
-1512362995
the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble
926627686
mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.  She
-223938928
would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a
459316253
moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with
-92341839
her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt.  Only one
-183390128
hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all
-99431765
the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the
1107220325
second storey: there she sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to
654865620
herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.
-1640934761

-1923438341
The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,
20691610
noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her
-1326419919
position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,
1494988918
indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the
-1883142420
charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying
1955782206
something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
-147417822

-1923438341
"She gets good wages, I guess?"
710962274

-1923438341
"Yes," said Leah; "I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain
-1265625549
of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of
2091032341
the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every
-1341531141
quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved
-334190729
enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's
23091589
got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able
-267719721
for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business."
-2081911567

-1923438341
"She is a good hand, I daresay," said the charwoman.
895111072

-1923438341
"Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better," rejoined Leah
-285588150
significantly; "and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all
332493690
the money she gets."
-854850086

-1923438341
"That it is not!" was the reply.  "I wonder whether the master--"
57265033

-1923438341
The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and
1476642692
she instantly gave her companion a nudge.
998108014

-1923438341
"Doesn't she know?" I heard the woman whisper.
994123690

-1923438341
Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.  All I
1750061212
had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at
-612065167
Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely
-1650066729
excluded.
-226829739

-1923438341
Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets
1875840848
were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes
-1206563658
spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:
-963766934
both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make
1261134328
them.  The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as
1616007060
the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness
801053331
of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with
-628947795
plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all
718716307
sides.
-1277608962

-1923438341
Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her
-1297634505
gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the
-1397839049
company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c.  Adele, too, would be
1025949350
dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to
1878607439
the party that day at least.  However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to
-8168891
apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks.  For myself, I had
678637712
no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my
2048586850
sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--"a
-1250030049
very pleasant refuge in time of trouble."
-684847490

-1923438341
It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards
-299496286
the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth
-1511526524
as heralds of summer.  It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was
1138896265
even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
515816672

-1923438341
"It gets late," said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.  "I am
-680290305
glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for
1525633813
it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there
-401654658
is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the
45166604
direction of Millcote."  She went to the window.  "Here he is!" said she.
-1589562418
"Well, John" (leaning out), "any news?"
682570513

-1923438341
"They're coming, ma'am," was the answer.  "They'll be here in ten
783073065
minutes."
-1331075663

-1923438341
Adele flew to the window.  I followed, taking care to stand on one side,
-1550511323
so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
422092978

-1923438341
The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were
-659184393
heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two
1144990258
open carriages.  Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles;
1487496307
two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was
-1627661465
Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at
1083305607
his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.  Her
-2136626815
purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on
-594383504
the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through
-1885801965
them, shone rich raven ringlets.
-789402265

-1923438341
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post
-78160371
below.
-620801656

-1923438341
The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle
1142993319
of the house, and I lost sight of it.  Adele now petitioned to go down;
769915879
but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not
-1774765349
on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or
1670541599
at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be
1242803206
very angry, &c.  "Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as
645486488
I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
-987564998

-1923438341
A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and
126720427
ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable
1448065672
above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of
-901005495
Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.
725185492
Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through
-1150306885
the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,
-1805589534
and, for a time, a hush.
-821465437

-1923438341
"Elles changent de toilettes," said Adele; who, listening attentively,
-408194169
had followed every movement; and she sighed.
1136747967

-1923438341
"Chez maman," said she, "quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais
-1372024935
partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de
-1558219858
chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela
1888017225
on apprend."
1447553061

-1923438341
"Don't you feel hungry, Adele?"
1144799531

-1923438341
"Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas
-2080694262
mange."
1817641319

-1923438341
"Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and
-863725150
get you something to eat."
-922259937

-1923438341
And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which
-2036781617
conducted directly to the kitchen.  All in that region was fire and
-223075070
commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and
-1647180922
the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening
2028361381
spontaneous combustion.  In the servants' hall two coachmen and three
-53437977
gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I
635697191
suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had
-837676204
been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.  Threading this
-73740644
chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold
2134620771
chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and
551620878
fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.  I had regained the
458753498
gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an
444459558
accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their
-1110686659
chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of
1322422517
their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of
2009131793
victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was
1580865918
dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
-903744028

-1923438341
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each
-2137796828
came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the
2122666900
dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of
69584586
the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then
-1964014628
descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down
140322877
a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-
2096936381
born elegance, such as I had never before received.
-1615774772

-1923438341
I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.
1686530358
"What beautiful ladies!" cried she in English.  "Oh, I wish I might go to
-1723118706
them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after
548973210
dinner?"
-930685784

-1923438341
"No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.
483459347
Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here
1024210441
is your dinner."
-1001616376

-1923438341
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her
1543457124
attention for a time.  It was well I secured this forage, or both she, I,
544010196
and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a
288763438
chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much
-513077119
engaged to think of us.  The dessert was not carried out till after nine
-628004094
and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee-
-582267636
cups.  I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared
-118154791
she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and
840965242
shutting below, and people bustling about.  Besides, she added, a message
-1167765299
might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; "et alors
61401047
quel dommage!"
1862925247

-1923438341
I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a
1710548096
change I took her out into the gallery.  The hall lamp was now lit, and
81231104
it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing
764815021
backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of
-151590195
music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;
-70300373
Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently
1256271762
a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who
303947041
sang, and very sweet her notes were.  The solo over, a duet followed, and
-5792471
then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.  I
688832993
listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on
628981274
analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the
325867306
confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them,
311495714
which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered
71118839
by distance inarticulate, into words.
-874990194

-1923438341
The clock struck eleven.  I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my
-887854254
shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and
407835743
carried her off to bed.  It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies
-31565672
sought their chambers.
-180347622

-1923438341
The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party
-387361667
to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.  They set out early in
-112730536
the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both
740699035
the departure and the return.  Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady
-239084327
equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two
-1648595064
rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to
302008553
Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--
-1964959907

-1923438341
"You said it was not likely they should think of being married," said I,
273783792
"but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other
-1844786486
ladies."
-691326866

-1923438341
"Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her."
1900126908

-1923438341
"And she him," I added; "look how she leans her head towards him as if
407624412
she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have
-266011820
never had a glimpse of it yet."
2002947564

-1923438341
"You will see her this evening," answered Mrs. Fairfax.  "I happened to
1967581718
remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the
898085389
ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after
1011737173
dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'"
-429111078

-1923438341
"Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure," I
1027242643
answered.
-2108729547

-1923438341
"Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not
-1031374946
think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and
458321670
he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is
653036451
my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in
-913598909
case of contumacy.'"
1496234404

-1923438341
"I will not give him that trouble," I answered.  "I will go, if no better
-1209622746
may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?"
1417112832

-1923438341
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage
550551879
so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is
-867651216
the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing-
-1717305822
room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose
-189467198
your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the
-110051037
gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are
907865026
there and then slip away--nobody will notice you."
1711752038

-1923438341
"Will these people remain long, do you think?"
-869892975

-1923438341
"Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter
1917179010
recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will
-789483086
have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will
1809766816
accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a
1508219006
stay at Thornfield."
687381515

-1923438341
It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I
-472213235
was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.  Adele had been in a
9138327
state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the
-1778796135
ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation
-1836200883
of dressing her that she sobered down.  Then the importance of the
115219479
process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged
517184648
in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her
-1337262032
long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any
1441083819
judge.  No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was
-1479855088
dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care
-25074386
previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and
-967115340
assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready.  This I quickly
-1499422325
was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's
-1646684699
wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon
-426084165
smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.  We
1247334331
descended.
-1257083641

-1923438341
Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that
-647100861
through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.  We found the
771019080
apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and
-1056562664
wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with
-15024718
which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:
-765071673
slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the
1529349860
adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their
353829142
conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
461703859

-1923438341
Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising
-412398781
impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to
-661496401
her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,
-369121537
endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she
1505229371
touched my knee.
218930516

-1923438341
"What is it, Adele?"
1842732352

-1923438341
"Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,
1388792439
mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette."
1272967276

-1923438341
"You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a
1388802507
flower."  And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash.  She
2058404596
sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were
2094729682
now full.  I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress:
1414834644
there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little
-533502646
Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
22101255

-1923438341
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back
-666495692
from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre
-1809413353
pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent
1549510418
dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the
-1916491171
opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
-901585884

-1923438341
There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the
851061815
impression of a much larger number.  Some of them were very tall; many
-1107201133
were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that
474418548
seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.  I rose and
-325035622
curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only
-611272832
stared at me.
-310397072

-1923438341
They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and
415752535
buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.  Some of
-2056382264
them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and
-1979259334
ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:
347303666
the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but
-647019984
clear tone which seemed habitual to them.  I knew their names afterwards,
-1136388607
and may as well mention them now.
592289004

-1923438341
First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters.  She had evidently
448171706
been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still.  Of her daughters,
483254963
the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and
-735989911
manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became
-255159355
her well.  The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure;
1362628271
with a very pretty face, of that order the French term _minois chiffone_:
-1485693047
both sisters were fair as lilies.
-1535561570

-1923438341
Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,
913175223
very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen:
764618165
her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and
40486420
within the circlet of a band of gems.
225619797

-1923438341
Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.  She
-113291791
had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.  Her black satin
-105847220
dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased
617137414
me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
-646903570

-1923438341
But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest
386132206
figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,
-1701018645
Blanche and Mary.  They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
519208372
The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;
834486790
her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were
-1856377077
still apparently perfect.  Most people would have termed her a splendid
360244612
woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then
-1547073855
there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her
73829461
bearing and countenance.  She had Roman features and a double chin,
-902044656
disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me
1971898874
not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the
493644918
chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost
944771771
preternatural erectness.  She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it
1832077476
reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice
2048160443
was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very
-1213757579
intolerable, in short.  A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some
-1740255644
gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a
-1513342049
truly imperial dignity.
206472742

-1923438341
Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.
-1619714985
Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I
-1398917727
regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see
131001378
whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;
-1037763346
secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted
1809727914
of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy
112441221
likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
1306773492

-1923438341
As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture
8452432
and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,
292989843
the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but
1489637115
her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed
-103435825
likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It
1496923912
was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her
876245567
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and
-1678542756
haughty lip.
1290191282

-1923438341
Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram
-966271843
was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious
-2126236674
indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.
-1337471185
Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she
278076152
said, she liked flowers, "especially wild ones;" Miss Ingram had, and she
-211919662
ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what
-1246837530
is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her
-899991799
ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-
-1716041293
natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice
1415885043
was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,
-150530272
with fluency and with a good accent.
-560806700

-1923438341
Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features
1667355005
too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a
-39249878
Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,
-1876043796
her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,
-841707870
remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired
1333141154
in spotless white.
-99858994

-1923438341
And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be
-410238128
likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female
-23596400
beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then
-630920652
she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I
-1072521337
thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have obtained
-218809057
proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them
1455112617
together.
497654547

-1923438341
You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting
144194030
motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she
281159639
rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with
689999711
gravity--
1010454079

-1923438341
"Bon jour, mesdames."
1881509323

-1923438341
And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and exclaimed,
-1856874395
"Oh, what a little puppet!"
-1464305917

-1923438341
Lady Lynn had remarked, "It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the
-1182870081
little French girl he was speaking of."
995647551

-1923438341
Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.
601366163

-1923438341
Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--"What a love of a
-470692250
child!"
456178128

-1923438341
And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced
1764495939
between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;
1850021185
absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton
-1058278471
and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.
-1614566858

-1923438341
At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in
-1171608837
the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the
-2048785744
window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The
-1107685099
collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very
-2076967711
imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some
1682653020
young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and
-1297224160
Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the
1416992581
district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and
1518053289
whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a
-1983013095
"pere noble de theatre."  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;
-1196946684
like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary's apathetic and
-928294700
listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of
965746150
blood or vigour of brain.
-1751025233

-1923438341
And where is Mr. Rochester?
1772440118

-1923438341
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.  I
1202922000
try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes
-1219054590
of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my
907117427
hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap;
225416407
whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the
1365954919
moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed,
1737175024
an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my
-373042979
face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to
-748683406
overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.  How near had I approached him
1282063987
at that moment!  What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my
-481892345
relative positions?  Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were!  So
-1885137321
far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me.  I did
-1218167008
not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side
1404900346
of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
-909197318

-1923438341
No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I
1901336941
might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily
-1159426214
to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise,
1484538073
and the irids would fix on him.  I looked, and had an acute pleasure in
-1162903394
looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely
1003008748
point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel
-2017186863
who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and
780960195
drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
-1471290930

-1923438341
Most true is it that "beauty is in the eye of the gazer."  My master's
149153896
colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,
-1981474466
deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision,
-1294498405
will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than
471521417
beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite
1556954405
mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them
-1886703924
in his.  I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought
1215240759
hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now,
1664566740
at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and
2025972713
strong!  He made me love him without looking at me.
505331771

-1923438341
I compared him with his guests.  What was the gallant grace of the Lynns,
1903832680
the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of
1028431754
Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power?
1358250124
I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could
-1692788145
imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome,
504186183
imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured
-1494493199
and melancholy-looking.  I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the
-400551270
light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of
797185017
the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester
1791328859
smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and
649006787
gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,
-1207980858
to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that
-2012978440
look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,
-2017986703
their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in
1894856884
no sense moved.  "He is not to them what he is to me," I thought: "he is
-993705850
not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel
-920162108
akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements:
-770828413
though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and
65263111
heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did
-1841356185
I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive
-473178892
my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other
413199921
light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true,
1432594552
vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must
1539481156
conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he
2071510091
cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not
-696806893
mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean
-276156055
only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must,
-765214256
then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I
1318744670
breathe and think, I must love him."
-886267545

-1923438341
Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become
151674395
lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and
1045147829
Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud
922060884
dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir
-1350123834
George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and
766258761
very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-
-550393362
cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has
-1021235930
taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a
385318133
splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says
68319845
little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on
2076793144
the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at
318693195
him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.
-1456588286
Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of
229822497
Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,
82005658
and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?
1433405905
She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She
2083444878
seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself
391276467
selects a mate.
-1666434010

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as
871165755
solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her
-264852815
station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
1439940547

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?"
-2123160148

-1923438341
"Nor am I."
1684199646

-1923438341
"Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?"
-2092380452
(pointing to Adele).  "Where did you pick her up?"
-1341370478

-1923438341
"I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands."
1649510583

-1923438341
"You should have sent her to school."
-1925425351

-1923438341
"I could not afford it: schools are so dear."
745000867

-1923438341
"Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her
112151749
just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-
568636594
curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as
1041578811
expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition."
1485315836

-1923438341
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.
-38795232
Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the
73574238
shade: but he never turned his eyes.
-973663022

-1923438341
"I have not considered the subject," said he indifferently, looking
-336400916
straight before him.
390355847

-1923438341
"No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear
-859168969
mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think,
-250722971
a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest
1302167676
ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?"
171878466

-1923438341
"Did you speak, my own?"
-445556423

-1923438341
The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated
1968794540
her question with an explanation.
522143525

-1923438341
"My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I
-1263848490
have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank
1408379413
Heaven I have now done with them!"
-508374805

-1923438341
Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her
1440328286
ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of
1263486422
the anathematised race was present.
91265117

-1923438341
"Tant pis!" said her Ladyship, "I hope it may do her good!"  Then, in a
-761243946
lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a
1586934925
judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
142915149

-1923438341
"What are they, madam?" inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.
713321343

-1923438341
"I will tell you in your private ear," replied she, wagging her turban
1517897513
three times with portentous significancy.
-1724042936

-1923438341
"But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now."
1209214658

-1923438341
"Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I."
-1354430935

-1923438341
"Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the
-170732566
whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from
80233234
them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to
771789176
play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was
-1364589561
always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with
-767114784
Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-
-1621411503
spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey
537728196
was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame
2122745106
Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to
-1943837146
extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our
-179381029
books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,
1504180598
the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?"
-1233961409

-1923438341
"Yaas, to be sure I do," drawled Lord Ingram; "and the poor old stick
-2122751902
used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on
-1040196062
the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,
1830494202
when she was herself so ignorant."
3055564

-1923438341
"We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or
1234959874
persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as
1036444664
we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in
-1476094541
love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry
2071314532
tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle
-1303634122
passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our
1785624354
discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights
-489304019
from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the
-1797519150
business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my
1509917790
lady-mother?"
-1136466253

-1923438341
"Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a
-386979961
thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never
1960363034
be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--"
-20814618

-1923438341
"Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know
1450081774
them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and
993375343
consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance
-665961850
and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny
-1959367907
and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?"
-1165124059

-1923438341
"My lily-flower, you are right now, as always."
-1405996771

-1923438341
"Then no more need be said: change the subject."
-961634151

-1923438341
Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her
-1222900176
soft, infantine tone: "Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but
-1532301008
she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her
170105465
out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?"
1522771031

-1923438341
"No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her
1846334521
workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,
2125987635
she would give us anything we asked for."
-1575561042

-1923438341
"I suppose, now," said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, "we
-628372817
shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in
299955984
order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new
-1308366639
topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?"
-1313249072

-1923438341
"Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other."
1685226405

-1923438341
"Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you
-1739561948
in voice to-night?"
-514375405

-1923438341
"Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be."
1282919174

-1923438341
"Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs
-1356446078
and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service."
1979695362

-1923438341
"Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?"
2057562858

-1923438341
"A fig for Rizzio!" cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as
-1614785658
she moved to the piano.  "It is my opinion the fiddler David must have
-1293221960
been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind
658031235
a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say
846617107
what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort
909211267
of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my
-1278677269
hand."
-1530309149

-1923438341
"Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?" cried
478948990
Mr. Rochester.
1352452755

-1923438341
"I should say the preference lies with you," responded Colonel Dent.
2113814516

-1923438341
"On my honour, I am much obliged to you," was the reply.
-19645164

-1923438341
Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,
107121506
spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant
740311692
prelude; talking meantime.  She appeared to be on her high horse
1485622280
to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only
330767992
the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent
-2050680868
on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
1574319084

-1923438341
"Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!" exclaimed she,
1401329285
rattling away at the instrument.  "Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a
704688007
step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's
-1968933630
permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their
1464275693
pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man
552419095
had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special
-1358476306
prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an
854997639
ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the
1645657591
_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:
-1371359009
let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a
-2077689129
fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man."
-1272690198

-1923438341
"Whenever I marry," she continued after a pause which none interrupted,
-111278137
"I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will
200516976
suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage:
-1919628591
his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his
1779084125
mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you."
-407662516

-1923438341
"I am all obedience," was the response.
-1774551485

-1923438341
"Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that
-1247456371
reason, sing it _con spirito_."
224262625

-1923438341
"Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and
-1884368445
water."
174259883

-1923438341
"Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how
-1155359048
such things _should_ be done."
242652716

-1923438341
"That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to
2050471497
fail."
-589789150

-1923438341
"Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a
-58422913
proportionate punishment."
1354496655

-1923438341
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict
178048727
a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
1695714986

-1923438341
"Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.
-392278999

-1923438341
"Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must
1889551889
inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for
294173046
capital punishment."
1949674810

-1923438341
"Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano, she commenced an
-926115593
accompaniment in spirited style.
-2111923525

-1923438341
"Now is my time to slip away," thought I: but the tones that then severed
-927388362
the air arrested me.  Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a
1410076121
fine voice: he did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own
1739719720
feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and
-902807493
there waking sensation strangely.  I waited till the last deep and full
938921258
vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had
-327464674
resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by
404979634
the side-door, which was fortunately near.  Thence a narrow passage led
1748196480
into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped
487097692
to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the
-2061777672
staircase.  I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;
-263538996
rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
-434566508

-1923438341
"How do you do?" he asked.
187211426

-1923438341
"I am very well, sir."
-986635069

-1923438341
"Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?"
1730921295

-1923438341
I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I
-1263112116
would not take that freedom.  I answered--
-2016899788

-1923438341
"I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir."
1032830047

-1923438341
"What have you been doing during my absence?"
-782582287

-1923438341
"Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual."
-436582254

-1923438341
"And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
251379793
What is the matter?"
1469148562

-1923438341
"Nothing at all, sir."
717620349

-1923438341
"Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?"
-564481746

-1923438341
"Not the least."
-1843283685

-1923438341
"Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early."
-847086919

-1923438341
"I am tired, sir."
-171140916

-1923438341
He looked at me for a minute.
-1642879553

-1923438341
"And a little depressed," he said.  "What about?  Tell me."
1345296851

-1923438341
"Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed."
2076272155

-1923438341
"But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would
-60621038
bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and
1642722149
swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
1878693658
If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a
1242190729
servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I
1750469777
excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you
-1541767528
to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect
1919511061
it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--"  He stopped,
343916643
bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
-1975677428

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XVIII
-970857322

-1923438341

-1923438341
Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
581458565
different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
-902918989
solitude I had passed beneath its roof!  All sad feelings seemed now
1026677354
driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life
1155536657
everywhere, movement all day long.  You could not now traverse the
725457302
gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
1254837151
tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
1920721652

-1923438341
The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,
931534535
were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when
-154340561
the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called
-1745997658
their occupants out into the grounds.  Even when that weather was broken,
386817568
and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over
-771656034
enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in
-8691375
consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
-1309742892

-1923438341
I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
1822288207
entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
1816632637
ignorance I did not understand the term.  The servants were called in,
380421290
the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
482334491
chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.  While Mr. Rochester and
1518133297
the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running
1541580036
up and down stairs ringing for their maids.  Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to
-1687561044
give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls,
737899971
dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey
243944515
were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped
-1233502161
petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought
-689687301
down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such
1061293961
things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the
1227795335
drawing-room.
142283424

-1923438341
Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and was
841889540
selecting certain of their number to be of his party.  "Miss Ingram is
-557372793
mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses Eshton, and
-1468223692
Mrs. Dent.  He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been
-711830403
fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
1277204731

-1923438341
"Will you play?" he asked.  I shook my head.  He did not insist, which I
-494441467
rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
1620587629
usual seat.
987173447

-1923438341
He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
-1462343692
was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.  One of
-73761329
the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should
-1074218210
be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
461368926

-1923438341
"No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
409905610

-1923438341
Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up.  Within the arch, the
-1400889021
bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen,
-1076781658
was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table, lay open a
-782841193
large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's
1284231694
cloak, and holding a book in her hand.  Somebody, unseen, rang the bell
-702725076
merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's
1412414962
party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of
602401533
flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of
-1797458295
Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of
-936917723
roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they
-45264707
drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,
-1329927236
dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony
1473306324
followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime
1641658995
of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted
1972546638
in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--
1284126963

-1923438341
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
1417196142

-1923438341
A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.  Its second rising
1436990857
displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.  The drawing-
1744384651
room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining-
-24637162
room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within
-897012572
the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an
987643207
ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by
-669008683
exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been
131821607
transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
1224110204

-1923438341
Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester,
-1766594010
costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head.  His dark eyes and swarthy
1965089899
skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he looked the very
143189457
model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
1917447310
Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram.  She, too, was attired in
-1462730816
oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an
1839733756
embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
-1074554857
beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
1582473554
supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head.  Both her cast of
-1294655215
form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the idea
31715266
of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
-1963376692
doubtless the character she intended to represent.
-2063883983

-1923438341
She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher; she
-882358398
again lifted it to her head.  The personage on the well-brink now seemed
-860284681
to accost her; to make some request:--"She hasted, let down her pitcher
-404229362
on her hand, and gave him to drink."  From the bosom of his robe he then
1220344144
produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and
-829945265
earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid the
-1894285662
treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her looks
-150716820
and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and the
812807263
rings in her ears.  It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
-1711550607
wanting.
-1557049723

-1923438341
The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could
125054763
not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.  Colonel
1396299380
Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the
-1414563275
curtain again descended.
963159919

-1923438341
On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the
-794520489
rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse
310586143
drapery.  The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table
2004246079
and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light
791107087
proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
-2047085731

-1923438341
Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
-2134766706
his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground.  I knew Mr. Rochester; though
-450939489
the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose from one
-904213650
arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a scuffle), the
1627508716
desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well
-1072300232
have disguised him.  As he moved, a chain clanked; to his wrists were
1664667416
attached fetters.
-1502822850

-1923438341
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
1352946574

-1923438341
A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
-794148481
ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room.  Mr. Rochester led in
-2038466083
Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
1359315181

-1923438341
"Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
1445162470
the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant
763104525
gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
-1837405282

-1923438341
"Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards her.
880445848

-1923438341
"Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your
221061103
complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
52526315

-1923438341
"You would like a hero of the road then?"
-55795415

-1923438341
"An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
523018342
bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
1930716293

-1923438341
"Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
-6835301
since, in the presence of all these witnesses."  She giggled, and her
-151834818
colour rose.
-1194030440

-1923438341
"Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn."  And as the
-16063412
other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats.  Miss
1827189800
Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
1774764674
filled the chairs on each side of him and her.  I did not now watch the
-1477832949
actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
1182384146
attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the
2139793893
arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.  What
360107103
charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they
-1063113192
acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the
-1720036933
consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss
1814017251
Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,
-446581668
till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his
626916553
cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
-1228479807
glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
-1289484522
returns in memory at this moment.
1596037110

-1923438341
I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could
-1256369031
not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice
-665394186
me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once
-1350750147
turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions
-886358154
appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her
83591378
robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me
744732939
by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to
-1021587651
merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would
560591935
soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security
-794222976
in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a
-510875736
style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought
-1669298555
than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its
-644151485
very pride, irresistible.
278948497

-1923438341
There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
-1518534704
much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
-280253573
jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
1765564846
woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the
-207034494
nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss
2136844280
Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
841116073
feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.  She was very
-1537000650
showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
-2115847656
attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
1502140695
bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
-1836034510
by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to
1071111729
repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
-1135581403
opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
-2021617984
not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
-2087160541
not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a
-2068647708
spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her
-473441576
away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;
-1893805412
sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
1926600343
coldness and acrimony.  Other eyes besides mine watched these
-409527994
manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.  Yes;
-1261849989
the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended
-2062400926
a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness
89658043
of his--this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects--this
1473334843
obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever-
1336362075
torturing pain arose.
-1975608532

-1923438341
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
-150643041
because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her
-835763195
his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him
-1049968225
that treasure.  This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched
-2044347680
and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could
-1065123987
not charm him_.
1766366861

-1923438341
If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely
-1822467525
laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the
-1641437521
wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.  If Miss Ingram had been a
2045081272
good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I
1950285481
should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair:
1466734842
then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired
555107595
her--acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days:
-1968576115
and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper would have been my
1597528545
admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.  But as matters really
2006416284
stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to
1786272209
witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail;
-1728698954
vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly
-72403104
pluming herself on success, when her pride and self-complacency repelled
-1648433244
further and further what she wished to allure--to witness _this_, was to
595515317
be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
634778893

-1923438341
Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows
1969802728
that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
2085674024
harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
1765448103
quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,
1719233040
and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a
637078934
silent conquest might have been won.
-1473068999

-1923438341
"Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
-291101348
near to him?" I asked myself.  "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
1824415057
like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles
1187505314
so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
-2020727302
elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by
-1143136077
merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
575763224
nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression
-1590016134
from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;
2106780155
but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and
-1154011063
calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he
-492350956
asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and
-435129310
it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a
407770349
fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are
419553282
married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;
43301005
and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun
-313617406
shines on."
1389851757

-1923438341
I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
-1399723483
marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first
940754635
discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely
-1077699580
to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but
-1561919748
the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the
-1689697609
less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or Miss Ingram
-1472484158
for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them,
1911637780
doubtless, from their childhood.  All their class held these principles:
631701808
I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not
1177570531
fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him, I would take
614350802
to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of
-668010445
the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan
-1836012116
convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of
503336862
which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the world would act
1073750451
as I wished to act.
392316340

-1923438341
But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
-201271461
master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
64239233
sharp look-out.  It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
-560360335
his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing
667387473
of both, to form an equitable judgment.  Now I saw no bad.  The sarcasm
2071048081
that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only
-1872784880
like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but
-1135034359
their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.  And as for the
938642921
vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a
-1706378276
desponding expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and
-1253419965
then, in his eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange
-1831760628
depth partially disclosed; that something which used to make me fear and
1981817019
shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and
1376488312
had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape: that something, I,
1735998057
at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with
-1910783082
palsied nerves.  Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to
192621526
divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might
1557435581
look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their
1776489190
nature.
1578563650

-1923438341
Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw
1892650115
only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
-491405627
movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their
608146804
own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
153467017
continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
-1921508440
turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
906630545
gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
1913953577
which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent
-369846484
talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a
-1287779665
courteous word or smile on me.  Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr.
-1705010711
Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business.  Lord
-1969120604
Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of
-1614127304
the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant
-1244404356
speeches of the other.  Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended
-996553427
their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after
1699280863
all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him--Miss Ingram
523792673
were the life and soul of the party.  If he was absent from the room an
1719284250
hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his
-394703123
guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the
1506963859
vivacity of conversation.
-1695214062

-1923438341
The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
485412833
day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely
813178152
to return till late.  The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
118160725
proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
1269807737
Hay, was consequently deferred.  Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
-1797269525
stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing
-1228338192
billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought
-1532917457
solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,
-103638751
by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to
1224318839
draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental
-379129438
tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the
979363497
library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and
-2139227754
prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of
-643002908
absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the
1037629747
merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
668658938

-1923438341
It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
882154187
hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the
1127883282
drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--
1154542691

-1923438341
"Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
885809243

-1923438341
I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,
391283551
looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
-2112322292
crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
-792187548
on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.
-1443429952

-1923438341
"What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.  "He
-812961632
rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot
-90057199
was with him:--what has he done with the animals?"
-488597815

-1923438341
As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
-2142803155
near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
-149265348
of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
-2132546056
she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The
-1286730847
post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
-880799201
alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was
1086494080
a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
-244895416

-1923438341
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
2140188812
(apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false
1066809951
intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
-1450941268

-1923438341
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
-899932583
He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
1939286739

-1923438341
"It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
-219775254
friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
1110028938
journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
-189884000
acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
146729715

-1923438341
His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
-1423525358
somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
-424492680
English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and
-320299987
forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
768458655
fine-looking man, at first sight especially.  On closer examination, you
-859808643
detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to
-1869596236
please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large
200294967
and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at
-1213477762
least so I thought.
1657062620

-1923438341
The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till
-1110172031
after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But
-1020530081
I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at
1287885308
the same time unsettled and inanimate.  His eye wandered, and had no
1303998193
meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I never
-638733668
remembered to have seen.  For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking
-1269012679
man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that
1696619623
smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline
1591982352
nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even
-522258684
forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
397902625

-1923438341
As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
175397136
girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him--for he occupied an
1166030996
arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if
1245604058
he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester.  I think (with deference
-1965258132
be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek
2095312279
gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated
1763772426
keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
-1277402467

-1923438341
He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship
-312987977
theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
86010482
that "extremes meet."
2046307455

-1923438341
Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps
1026950878
of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much
-567955615
sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
-1276491841
Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
-586038286
reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they
139363188
both called him "a beautiful man."  Louisa said he was "a love of a
136302786
creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
-49302059
mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
-681540301

-1923438341
"And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,--"so
-1279856726
smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such
1472289025
a placid eye and smile!"
869813723

-1923438341
And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
832970766
side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
76942129
Hay Common.
1823945384

-1923438341
I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and
1465489416
I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I
289227689
learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came from
2098183708
some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
644945024
sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
1755305506
house.  Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
226303661
the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
52311019
gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
-302070663
with Mr. Rochester.  He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
1061397036
heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region.  I knew Mr.
954455285
Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
-271955970
the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had never
-1227291990
heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
1042874670

-1923438341
I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat unexpected
1560173231
one, broke the thread of my musings.  Mr. Mason, shivering as some one
683578303
chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire,
-1289058004
which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot
534298653
and red.  The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near
-1959586701
Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low voice, of which I
-428177396
heard only the words, "old woman,"--"quite troublesome."
1604948930

-1923438341
"Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
2110883116
off," replied the magistrate.
-339916360

-1923438341
"No--stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent.  "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
263219978
might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies."  And
1987337869
speaking aloud, he continued--"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
-250266972
to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches
120083907
is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought
-10924741
in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to
730900349
see her?"
-802582708

-1923438341
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low
-106924774
impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
1117390737

-1923438341
"But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
-1392856114
can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
1282598938
her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says
-229596909
nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here."
1574354846

-1923438341
"What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
1786301204

-1923438341
"'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she
472305683
must and will do it."
-866023341

-1923438341
"What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
111266892

-1923438341
"A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
2064375896

-1923438341
"Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn.  "Let us have her
365257305
in, of course."
-578245818

-1923438341
"To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
1995153392
throw away such a chance of fun."
-1201478498

-1923438341
"My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
1127362609

-1923438341
"I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding," chimed
-1645864620
in the Dowager Ingram.
-1084538203

-1923438341
"Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
466199695
Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
-1868373428
sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music.  "I have a
1247658287
curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
-548230586
forward."
-2081984492

-1923438341
"My darling Blanche! recollect--"
1746440548

-1923438341
"I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick,
-1871798503
Sam!"
662719757

-1923438341
"Yes--yes--yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen.  "Let
1509040915
her come--it will be excellent sport!"
830517895

-1923438341
The footman still lingered.  "She looks such a rough one," said he.
550144019

-1923438341
"Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
-20508923

-1923438341
Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
575085683
and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
251555863

-1923438341
"She won't come now," said he.  "She says it's not her mission to appear
-1597250990
before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room
531138627
by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by
1279536412
one."
-868961114

-1923438341
"You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.  Be
1229878967
advised, my angel girl--and--"
1622138722

-1923438341
"Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl."  "It is
-1315845736
not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to
14967941
have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?"
1193279722

-1923438341
"Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler."
-81210126

-1923438341
"Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
683068202

-1923438341
Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full flow
841682509
once more.
334088481

-1923438341
"She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared.  "She wishes to
-1165422461
know who will be her first visitor."
1289597511

-1923438341
"I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,"
394527027
said Colonel Dent.
808650124

-1923438341
"Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
1890131877

-1923438341
Sam went and returned.
-1205531046

-1923438341
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
-1532979826
themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing
1203471306
a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
789194438

-1923438341
"By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
-1311290442

-1923438341
Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which might
-556393380
have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van
1737507966
of his men.
-1900257290

-1923438341
"Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
-168849893
she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
-211188218
Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
801008341

-1923438341
A comparative silence ensued.  Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
847342961
her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for
-2128183762
her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
-862381402
their breath, and looked a little frightened.
340969169

-1923438341
The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-
-1681696365
door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
-171179370

-1923438341
Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a
37596450
glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
407130372
coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
565249408
her seat, and took it in silence.
2105700100

-1923438341
"Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
104323303

-1923438341
"What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
-2144703830

-1923438341
"What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?"
-1266848658
demanded the Misses Eshton.
-146798082

-1923438341
"Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
-1300901406
Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,
546757305
by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this
451719602
matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who
-937053747
is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy
1351532254
vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry
2072119802
and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now
1897531267
I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow
-1087258017
morning, as he threatened."
-270217240

-1923438341
Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined further
-399557350
conversation.  I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that
-2105466850
time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more
-2110830163
dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had
1546423423
obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from
-909578108
her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
-1534420629
notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to
-2080821003
whatever revelations had been made her.
-1343917593

-1923438341
{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}
1117223336

-1923438341
Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go
-1112251912
alone; and yet they all wished to go.  A negotiation was opened through
-411355166
the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,
-810485227
till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,
1710331796
permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous
-217405104
Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
-175821489

-1923438341
Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
219443966
hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
-10622799
at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
-1246399616
running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
-98158515

-1923438341
"I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all.  "She
1649167797
told us such things!  She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
1626893769
into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
-864063361

-1923438341
Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
-1164296825
things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
-1003995085
books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
-2118788263
different relations had presented to them.  They affirmed that she had
1081015240
even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
-765627728
name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what
-756524522
they most wished for.
981676780

-1923438341
Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
118397785
enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
-1771719768
ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The
-644553254
matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and
-1751917638
again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had
1611123129
not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger
-398668027
urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
380349289

-1923438341
In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged
-526485747
in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and
819988574
saw Sam.
853902586

-1923438341
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
1159715704
single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
-1301370346
will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no
-458223014
one else for it.  What shall I tell her?"
-1632923420

-1923438341
"Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
-138344197
unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.  I slipped
-1706482241
out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in
582875495
one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door
-834882721
quietly behind me.
-217167287

-1923438341
"If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she
-260929821
frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
-2121582442

-1923438341
"No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid."  Nor was
1695167266
I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
-1716759551

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XIX
-650363056

-1923438341

-1923438341
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if
1848277272
Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney-
625433978
corner.  She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad-
-1274579666
brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her chin.
-1802660292
An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending over the fire,
941023901
and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the
-1710473650
light of the blaze: she muttered the words to herself, as most old women
-1896066598
do, while she read; she did not desist immediately on my entrance: it
-318425570
appeared she wished to finish a paragraph.
1988366662

-1923438341
I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
327604425
sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.  I felt now as composed
1299683248
as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's
-724610253
appearance to trouble one's calm.  She shut her book and slowly looked
1292167258
up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she
-2112936956
raised it, that it was a strange one.  It looked all brown and black: elf-
2080994415
locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin,
1544801885
and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye confronted me at
-1083205548
once, with a bold and direct gaze.
-128199190

-1923438341
"Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
-1834737869
as her glance, as harsh as her features.
-1692502968

-1923438341
"I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
1494143377
warn you, I have no faith."
-1617770518

-1923438341
"It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in
-1090259020
your step as you crossed the threshold."
-1024925998

-1923438341
"Did you?  You've a quick ear."
-2070713557

-1923438341
"I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
230126842

-1923438341
"You need them all in your trade."
1243872463

-1923438341
"I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't
-13785239
you tremble?"
1259207821

-1923438341
"I'm not cold."
39117945

-1923438341
"Why don't you turn pale?"
-2119046250

-1923438341
"I am not sick."
-1465497704

-1923438341
"Why don't you consult my art?"
1795936464

-1923438341
"I'm not silly."
-1027603737

-1923438341
The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
565073345
drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.  Having
194229303
indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
444523424
pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
992287745
deliberately--"You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
640679265

-1923438341
"Prove it," I rejoined.
564539681

-1923438341
"I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
662710935
strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best
1635941226
of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away
-228800694
from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon
1408789329
it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits
-1828145301
you."
-1027683220

-1923438341
She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
1737764825
with vigour.
1755055131

-1923438341
"You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
-1032576543
solitary dependent in a great house."
-1458945648

-1923438341
"I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
-881350182
one?"
-1582082281

-1923438341
"In my circumstances."
-199616170

-1923438341
"Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
598645679
placed as you are."
-1360335593

-1923438341
"It would be easy to find you thousands."
1168579810

-1923438341
"You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly
307468082
situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials
644009564
are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance
-1131208205
laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results."
1134219853

-1923438341
"I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life."
682927031

-1923438341
"If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
1192273834

-1923438341
"And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
1315222047

-1923438341
"To be sure."
912851667

-1923438341
I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
708757782
took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
-154344369
told me to hold out my hand.  I did.  She approached her face to the
870196053
palm, and pored over it without touching it.
-819616377

-1923438341
"It is too fine," said she.  "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
-271073881
almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written
140493407
there."
1659317586

-1923438341
"I believe you," said I.
-1130771281

-1923438341
"No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes,
1212413730
in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head."
-1062541852

-1923438341
"Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her.  "I shall
-2106860208
begin to put some faith in you presently."
-1826774286

-1923438341
I knelt within half a yard of her.  She stirred the fire, so that a
-2072759839
ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as she
-312316281
sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
1290677666

-1923438341
"I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when she
-1024400665
had examined me a while.  "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart
-522540692
during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting
129231599
before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic
526115962
communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere
-527782959
shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
-1120773062

-1923438341
"I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
-1902536864

-1923438341
"Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
-1558076627
whispers of the future?"
-907600256

-1923438341
"Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to
-2063239157
set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
-1129383019

-1923438341
"A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window-
-1014064259
seat (you see I know your habits )--"
-1851865660

-1923438341
"You have learned them from the servants."
1030416822

-1923438341
"Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
180641095
have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--"
-327677280

-1923438341
I started to my feet when I heard the name.
-775393948

-1923438341
"You have--have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
-302507252
after all, then!"
-467624340

-1923438341
"Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
79073813
Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But,
-169745165
as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but
1947437361
your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company
1887903077
who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you
-271764417
study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?"
-2120942951

-1923438341
"I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
613802172

-1923438341
"But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?"
-719517934

-1923438341
"I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
-1004121321
tale: it amuses me to watch them."
1432193528

-1923438341
"What tale do you like best to hear?"
-788855888

-1923438341
"Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same
-1317875646
theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage."
-1706772638

-1923438341
"And do you like that monotonous theme?"
895972792

-1923438341
"Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
969473290

-1923438341
"Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health,
2080630501
charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits
326470368
and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--"
-1199934102

-1923438341
"I what?"
1257789834

-1923438341
"You know--and perhaps think well of."
-250982441

-1923438341
"I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a
1042968848
syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
-1246922485
some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
-1992234847
dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
972118483
be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
-1867577984
disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
177451194

-1923438341
"You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable
505822974
with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!"
660924232

-1923438341
"He is not at home."
705711605

-1923438341
"A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this
-357841593
morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
851922839
circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as
-1758144541
it were, out of existence?"
1352659894

-1923438341
"No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
1895808673
you had introduced."
-1025836030

-1923438341
"I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so
-1172920801
many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow
-200487911
like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?"
-830515634

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
985730697

-1923438341
"No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
1542166243
the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with
-1501667571
the most lively and the most continuous?"
345493957

-1923438341
"The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator."  I said
294530149
this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
350020055
manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.  One unexpected
-2117457801
sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
58951803
of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
445000908
weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
-1851882068

-1923438341
"Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
38047999
the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight
-851550559
in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to
-1755670466
receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have
577616339
noticed this?"
-1681887023

-1923438341
"Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
691366692

-1923438341
"Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not
-1069722218
gratitude?"
-501825108

-1923438341
I said nothing.
-1657074441

-1923438341
"You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen
-1618056435
him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
131193520

-1923438341
"Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
1901143984

-1923438341
"What the devil have you seen, then?"
-963416224

-1923438341
"Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that
1466510403
Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
-935744498

-1923438341
"Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
-705956864

-1923438341
"Shortly?"
287201965

-1923438341
"Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
1907010034
an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
1515338795
they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome,
-287990617
noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
265347560
his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester
-743189643
estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
1774425910
something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
-1065132422
grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her
-429697319
blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
1850918256
clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--"
-1857603150

-1923438341
"But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
-1200677586
hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
1251137095

-1923438341
"Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
1660264110
contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
-1712413423
I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it
-1216742896
carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself
575664672
to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is
812556144
the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug."
-1225647818

-1923438341
"Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
1167545296

-1923438341
{She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair:
1889693376
p190.jpg}
244676687

-1923438341
I knelt.  She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
-2087567753
her chair.  She began muttering,--
638381790

-1923438341
"The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
-1162979432
and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
1777514220
impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
-193583932
to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
1425110956
signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it
835325768
will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance,
-66874771
the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge
1894159448
both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in
686847144
my opinion.  The eye is favourable.
-1086723845

-1923438341
"As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
1056171650
impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent
-1549764268
on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never
-93195563
intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
-319436762
mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
-1790115555
for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.
-1067022784

-1923438341
"I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
-1001413192
professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
1052117224
require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an
-326467357
inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
-685342489
delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
-1570694791
to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
2133262732
and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
1452542229
chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
1760955254
are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
1570681806
shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in
-287551067
every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but
2029626141
I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the
633208010
dictates of conscience.'
1551803622

-1923438341
"Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed
610202425
my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the
1448238095
claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth
-923083092
would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
722423723
dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want
774498004
sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster,
1139260347
not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of
-1065824185
brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will
-70040073
do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now
572611933
to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have
1064610551
governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would
-1299499232
act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave
-346811894
me; the play is played out'."
-1731237435

-1923438341
Where was I?  Did I wake or sleep?  Had I been dreaming?  Did I dream
30727821
still?  The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
33983781
all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my
1921517538
own tongue.  I got up, but did not go.  I looked; I stirred the fire, and
213480699
I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her
-1041078196
face, and again beckoned me to depart.  The flame illuminated her hand
-188849069
stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once
1947967450
noticed that hand.  It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own;
-195718035
it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
881603164
turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward,
33546691
I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.  Again I
282264031
looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary,
1743691557
the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
-2045173234

-1923438341
"Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
1610443807

-1923438341
"Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--"
1371150248

-1923438341
"But the string is in a knot--help me."
190415572

-1923438341
"Break it, sir."
1196893986

-1923438341
"There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'"  And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
1047553444
disguise.
999011790

-1923438341
"Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
-835665939

-1923438341
"But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?"
-2175413

-1923438341
"With the ladies you must have managed well."
1522505218

-1923438341
"But not with you?"
-2024465949

-1923438341
"You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
-955948637

-1923438341
"What character did I act?  My own?"
-975333919

-1923438341
"No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to
1022161037
draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
-1443689990
nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir."
244438980

-1923438341
"Do you forgive me, Jane?"
354186618

-1923438341
"I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I
1009309128
find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
-1644421565
but it was not right."
-312972019

-1923438341
"Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible."
1595605046

-1923438341
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.  It was a comfort; but,
-508350843
indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
652355102
interview.  Something of masquerade I suspected.  I knew gipsies and
650286156
fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had
1785814595
expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her anxiety to
-1229706069
conceal her features.  But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that
-1109980074
living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her.  I had
-452727316
never thought of Mr. Rochester.
1510285174

-1923438341
"Well," said he, "what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile
270526747
signify?"
460412210

-1923438341
"Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire
-570510085
now, I suppose?"
-878448224

-1923438341
"No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
-2120257150
yonder are doing."
-375901740

-1923438341
"Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
1621603811

-1923438341
"Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me."
-1259037387

-1923438341
"I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh,
-857335415
are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you
1235559564
left this morning?"
-1710659553

-1923438341
"A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?"
-1453046813

-1923438341
"No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of
1681358340
installing himself here till you returned."
1060326478

-1923438341
"The devil he did!  Did he give his name?"
-1890025790

-1923438341
"His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish
-852246940
Town, in Jamaica, I think."
-1841124226

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
-1594396735
me to a chair.  As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
1256897895
on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
1777037230

-1923438341
"Mason!--the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
171551883
speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!--the West
1517511724
Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
1124774763
growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
-1513958182
seemed to know what he was doing.
-2133561954

-1923438341
"Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
1987529074

-1923438341
"Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!"  He staggered.
-501315676

-1923438341
"Oh, lean on me, sir."
-1674172523

-1923438341
"Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
-1429367997

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
-1172706231

-1923438341
He sat down, and made me sit beside him.  Holding my hand in both his
1200538669
own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled
804590627
and dreary look.
-966268447

-1923438341
"My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
-744255222
you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me."
21396847

-1923438341
"Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you."
909887014

-1923438341
"Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that."
-2046093924

-1923438341
"Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it."
-815132975

-1923438341
"Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
230855358
at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
1664078652
doing."
-2013149031

-1923438341
I went.  I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
392101524
Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was
-303983529
arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
1975554678
about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
845271169
Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and
358736265
animated.  Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs.
-1657618034
Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.  I filled a wine-glass (I saw
1202447977
Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she thought I was taking a
-1601745584
liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the library.
-422721657

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
199013975
firm and stern.  He took the glass from my hand.
928366258

-1923438341
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said.  He swallowed the
1803140678
contents and returned it to me.  "What are they doing, Jane?"
1377195782

-1923438341
"Laughing and talking, sir."
-557796176

-1923438341
"They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
580795984
strange?"
-1832207711

-1923438341
"Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
1516663820

-1923438341
"And Mason?"
-2144433536

-1923438341
"He was laughing too."
1184967065

-1923438341
"If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
-1303655922
Jane?"
-854138768

-1923438341
"Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
222185328

-1923438341
He half smiled.  "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me
1310122187
coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off
453286213
and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?"
2077390351

-1923438341
"I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
-2072378101
you."
-1027683220

-1923438341
"To comfort me?"
-343289846

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
-1761666230

-1923438341
"And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
591180239

-1923438341
"I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should
-1669418361
care nothing about it."
-791978237

-1923438341
"Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
898440903

-1923438341
"I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as
-2101897927
you, I am sure, do."
-1730902775

-1923438341
"Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his
1844471541
ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here
-525308022
and then leave me."
-1418305819

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
I did his behest.  The company all stared at me as I passed straight
-1020601093
among them.  I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
-1283102880
from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went upstairs.
787222773

-1923438341
At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
-1065403703
repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
2039567889
heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
1930081987

-1923438341
He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.  I was soon
-425639438
asleep.
-1914707088

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XX
-687706348

-1923438341

-1923438341
I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let
-2039784267
down my window-blind.  The consequence was, that when the moon, which was
1677333424
full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that
-520142680
space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the
-90219279
unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me.  Awaking in the dead of
-1208932390
night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear.  It
1932070393
was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw
-1249819124
the curtain.
-13572478

-1923438341
Good God!  What a cry!
837947052

-1923438341
The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
1687079585
a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
736031440

-1923438341
My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
611745900
The cry died, and was not renewed.  Indeed, whatever being uttered that
1753031545
fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on
-1522301819
the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud
-1345359234
shrouding his eyrie.  The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere
1830066303
it could repeat the effort.
968072567

-1923438341
It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.  And
427137813
overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a
752161406
struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
-998421337
voice shouted--
2061049728

-1923438341
"Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
2066717991

-1923438341
"Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping
-760973804
went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
-1068490400

-1923438341
"Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
-508933435

-1923438341
A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
-153357460
Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there
262140649
was silence.
-2047969701

-1923438341
I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
947405443
from my apartment.  The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
-1930310142
terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
610658751
looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.  Gentlemen and
-438937826
ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"--"Who is
-712769272
hurt?"--"What has happened?"--"Fetch a light!"--"Is it fire?"--"Are there
1178533613
robbers?"--"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
-187366904
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness.  They
-1853523916
ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
960269162
confusion was inextricable.
182916902

-1923438341
"Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent.  "I cannot find him
-784332027
in his bed."
-1083778058

-1923438341
"Here! here!" was shouted in return.  "Be composed, all of you: I'm
-427792228
coming."
-509582247

-1923438341
And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced
1724892385
with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.  One of the
-1105635438
ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss Ingram.
145508696

-1923438341
"What awful event has taken place?" said she.  "Speak! let us know the
613134638
worst at once!"
1974766808

-1923438341
"But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
1475511342
Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
-51868315
wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
-1601995388

-1923438341
"All's right!--all's right!" he cried.  "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
1601185543
Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
547105036

-1923438341
And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks.  Calming himself
1577284127
by an effort, he added--
945188200

-1923438341
"A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable,
306936467
nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something
-1998473968
of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I
2077934657
must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled,
-1359749158
she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the
-504433883
ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing
1411318585
superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a
-270054249
pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames" (to the dowagers), "you will take
-999129489
cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer."
-1725749274

-1923438341
And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to get
873189369
them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.  I did not
-1083297432
wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I
743090340
had left it.
-485927038

-1923438341
Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
2131463822
carefully.  The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
1396884654
had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
1654248906
proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a
-447388564
servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that
-722045964
the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to
-627740110
pacify his guests.  I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.  When
1387936822
dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent
-1633428418
grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not what.  It seemed
-1421020330
to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
949910325

-1923438341
No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in
-217101053
about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.  It seemed
-834575018
that sleep and night had resumed their empire.  Meantime the moon
-524424315
declined: she was about to set.  Not liking to sit in the cold and
1829441577
darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.  I left
1516197517
the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped
-1593664810
to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
-876616162

-1923438341
"Am I wanted?" I asked.
-334050620

-1923438341
"Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
703001116

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And dressed?"
-773712447

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Come out, then, quietly."
480272391

-1923438341
I obeyed.  Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
704482470

-1923438341
"I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
805545702
noise."
-1876876888

-1923438341
My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
-1438741850
He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low
-1939904856
corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his
998584872
side.
368158938

-1923438341
"Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
-1492550214

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Have you any salts--volatile salts?"
1208862606

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Go back and fetch both."
176905364

-1923438341
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
-868819244
and once more retraced my steps.  He still waited; he held a key in his
678638164
hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
1793967290
he paused, and addressed me again.
379638882

-1923438341
"You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
-1189538780

-1923438341
"I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
1068260460

-1923438341
I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no faintness.
-718625016

-1923438341
"Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
965058390
fit."
-1455667558

-1923438341
I put my fingers into his.  "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
-1898381980
the key and opened the door.
-1001528708

-1923438341
I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
-1643395334
showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was
239164183
now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then
363185972
been concealed.  This door was open; a light shone out of the room
1485472955
within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
940007378
quarrelling.  Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait a
-1673377936
minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment.  A shout of laughter
-415139049
greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's
510113929
own goblin ha! ha!  _She_ then was there.  He made some sort of
649417042
arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him: he
1988703205
came out and closed the door behind him.
-323098724

-1923438341
"Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
-358772331
bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
-16671187
the chamber.  An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
672103892
dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
515776321
back; his eyes were closed.  Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
-486561609
recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
-1159993804
I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
-2141425732
blood.
-1321477220

-1923438341
"Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a basin
468995872
of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he.  I obeyed.  He took
-1011383005
the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he asked
-1814344896
for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.  Mr. Mason
1767576132
shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned.  Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of
-1753428141
the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away
583130277
blood, trickling fast down.
1936993039

-1923438341
"Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
59683553

-1923438341
"Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll
312497552
fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
-323478421
morning, I hope.  Jane," he continued.
-905897556

-1923438341
"Sir?"
-1350564325

-1923438341
"I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour,
-1158418538
or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns:
1801441499
if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his
1138581827
lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any
1790316147
pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak
-1293783408
to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the
-1270520637
consequences."
-472800264

-1923438341
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
814695108
either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
-1342763853
Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to
-454748294
use it as he had done.  He watched me a second, then saying,
-2095489954
"Remember!--No conversation," he left the room.  I experienced a strange
1723456374
feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
-382190190
step ceased to be heard.
-1364892235

-1923438341
Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
-709238690
cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
-1083075946
hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that
-1991750484
was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
340149264
Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
-2042442371

-1923438341
I must keep to my post, however.  I must watch this ghastly
2054021475
countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now
-1736168843
shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and
2109402848
ever glazed with the dulness of horror.  I must dip my hand again and
-96377227
again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
-39498563
I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the
-1342653031
shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black
-975140214
under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the
1858216152
doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve
1103485548
panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each
866195303
enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top
1108941517
rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
-967337570

-1923438341
According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or
62880134
glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
-1494039687
brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of
544608320
Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
-1181431977
threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his
1121502045
subordinate's form.
1388317044

-1923438341
Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
1002347515
movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.  But since
-1523638122
Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
-1280417059
three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal
453044058
of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
922862716

-1923438341
Then my own thoughts worried me.  What crime was this that lived
-1910211709
incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor
-34386786
subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now
-457118219
in blood, at the deadest hours of night?  What creature was it, that,
993850987
masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a
570897936
mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
-630773563

-1923438341
And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he
-1248500340
become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him?
-1891299884
What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when
1482419964
he should have been asleep in bed?  I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him
902045447
an apartment below--what brought him here!  And why, now, was he so tame
-423266708
under the violence or treachery done him?  Why did he so quietly submit
1886713472
to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced?  Why _did_ Mr. Rochester
-1140332164
enforce this concealment?  His guest had been outraged, his own life on a
-121347069
former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he
-96035918
smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!  Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was
-1413397114
submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held
1615773416
complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had
416592490
passed between them assured me of this.  It was evident that in their
-742451138
former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been
1619729545
habitually influenced by the active energy of the other: whence then had
-657439385
arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?  Why
334684341
had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his word now
336338637
sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him, a few hours since, as a
-1857832524
thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
1810740219

-1923438341
Oh!  I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
-911364098
"Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane."  I could not forget
-542029520
how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
-593354004
light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
-1040937164
vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
1194001875

-1923438341
"When will he come?  When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
1402408356
lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
521787495
and neither day nor aid arrived.  I had, again and again, held the water
-1090154989
to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts:
-518798250
my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss
-389653612
of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength.  He
917945759
moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and
477884174
I might not even speak to him.
-1167782115

-1923438341
The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks
671666982
of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
-1930242122
Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant kennel in the
1074882938
courtyard: hope revived.  Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more
282092448
the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved.  It
-987209788
could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed
-568959189
shorter.
1486089426

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
-492594108

-1923438341
"Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
526894093
half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the
928037855
patient downstairs and all."
-272715564

-1923438341
"But is he fit to move, sir?"
1932660160

-1923438341
"No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
1367236463
be kept up.  Come, set to work."
1176252050

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let
-211300648
in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how
-2094810075
far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the
-262051967
east.  Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.
743612872

-1923438341
"Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
-800974561

-1923438341
"She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
-675402261

-1923438341
"Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
2136574240
worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him
-407710189
there's no danger."
1961561439

-1923438341
"I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
-910845653
bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
-1430702992
bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
1604677228
as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
19165221
here!"
-865544363

-1923438341
"She bit me," he murmured.  "She worried me like a tigress, when
-1168639605
Rochester got the knife from her."
475299533

-1923438341
"You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,"
1282737916
said Mr. Rochester.
-1283697953

-1923438341
"But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason.  "Oh,
1426733212
it was frightful!" he added, shuddering.  "And I did not expect it: she
-1596655096
looked so quiet at first."
1386314581

-1923438341
"I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said--be on your guard when
-1447972140
you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
-666056602
me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
-1795726048
alone."
1979175716

-1923438341
"I thought I could have done some good."
-236533144

-1923438341
"You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
1307104727
however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
1618911680
taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun
1220664442
will soon rise, and I must have him off."
795661542

-1923438341
"Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other
-805870265
wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
1768894766

-1923438341
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
679082022

-1923438341
I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
946592035
horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only
-2001596319
said--
-476569688

-1923438341
"Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
-1807785988
it."
-74381758

-1923438341
"I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
315122764

-1923438341
"You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
-2075817369
Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not
-433165081
think of her at all."
-15193612

-1923438341
"Impossible to forget this night!"
-1550661614

-1923438341
"It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as
1483239196
dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
805650854
There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a
-1774185932
trice.  Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his re-entrance),
-1255514771
"take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into
-1480591930
my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a
-1831695408
clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble."
629643369

-1923438341
I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named,
-986655536
and returned with them.
-1197131827

-1923438341
"Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
-125637804
toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
-391214928

-1923438341
I retired as directed.
1014066043

-1923438341
"Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
554379271
Rochester presently.
758530958

-1923438341
"No, sir; all was very still."
-1463741120

-1923438341
"We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your
140316421
sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long
1628496026
to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here,
-2125080062
Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred
-1592421754
cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold
382223980
climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one
-1123338173
next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there."
-1730136518

-1923438341
Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
-352140214
edged with fur.
-1368526143

-1923438341
"Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
1850918269
away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a
919306821
clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open
-1350519033
the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
1358592777
little glass you will find there,--quick!"
-95750031

-1923438341
I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
-43745755

-1923438341
"That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
-811932532
dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an
-1692688424
Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a
-2105352227
thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now,
79639527
for instance.  Jane, a little water."
-968229739

-1923438341
He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on
-1989488744
the washstand.
1179640566

-1923438341
"That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial."
695587647

-1923438341
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it
-282905628
to Mason.
-232872770

-1923438341
"Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so."
-380432198

-1923438341
"But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?"
-628287942

-1923438341
"Drink! drink! drink!"
638931908

-1923438341
Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist.  He was
-364171136
dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
359923058
Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed the
-341302902
liquid; he then took his arm--
-278989832

-1923438341
"Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said--"try."
-1959211459

-1923438341
The patient rose.
-263255523

-1923438341
"Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard;
-72660036
step out--that's it!"
363835780

-1923438341
"I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
975886034

-1923438341
"I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
648038767
unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you
155740927
will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his
-538831471
rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane,
1360275620
if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
942080150

-1923438341
It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
-1908526919
rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.  The side-passage
417772143
door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all the
1329541238
yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
-2072747737
post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
-679182050
stationed outside.  I approached him, and said the gentlemen were coming;
915499701
he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened.  The stillness of
328305365
early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the
1715695147
servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the
343727156
blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands
-1095574621
over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped
1443811891
from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
-13997910

-1923438341
The gentlemen now appeared.  Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
261447878
surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
-1453977352
chaise; Carter followed.
626473555

-1923438341
"Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
-912677285
your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
-554990497
see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?"
-1833091247

-1923438341
"The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
-1461879434

-1923438341
"Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye,
-1726521511
Dick."
-737359816

-1923438341
"Fairfax--"
1540972842

-1923438341
"Well what is it?"
25395642

-1923438341
"Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let
-1452236341
her--" he stopped and burst into tears.
-1474647775

-1923438341
"I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he shut
778358000
up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
644591950

-1923438341
"Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester, as
1706314608
he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
-848304544

-1923438341
This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
-1459505328
the wall bordering the orchard.  I, supposing he had done with me,
117962407
prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
1860953128
He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
1843512059

-1923438341
"Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
1481207412
house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
1465756873

-1923438341
"It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
2053817619

-1923438341
"The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
-1767763353
see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
-207634662
slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
-1241753513
and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_" (he
-507140145
pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet, and
-276711374
pure."
-636887249

-1923438341
He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and
-1008740244
cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of
-933210064
old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies,
-920285125
mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.  They
-1483615031
were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a
109402275
lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the
-1842330077
dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees
-1975628613
and shone down the quiet walks under them.
-629586380

-1923438341
"Jane, will you have a flower?"
-1749133755

-1923438341
He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
310711216
me.
1968460902

-1923438341
"Thank you, sir."
1465250451

-1923438341
"Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds
382547357
which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly
508565838
atmosphere?"
-875159883

-1923438341
"I do, very much."
-19085552

-1923438341
"You have passed a strange night, Jane."
144077274

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone
-1149554479
with Mason?"
-1664287543

-1923438341
"I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
1566967454

-1923438341
"But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have
1970432905
been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a
-1049913604
wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
-281466018

-1923438341
"Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
227081094

-1923438341
"Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your
-1184727220
thoughts."
-1836952491

-1923438341
"Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
-1605895918

-1923438341
"Never fear--I will take care of myself."
1893212946

-1923438341
"Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
-510413111

-1923438341
"I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To
-1473973170
live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and
-893902791
spue fire any day."
5282844

-1923438341
"But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently
1554436349
potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure
-991814968
you."
-1027683220

-1923438341
"Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but,
-1002230770
unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me,
1390169913
if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
-115607723

-1923438341
"Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
1742167713
how to avert the danger."
-552336872

-1923438341
He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
1815606270
from him.
1493675546

-1923438341
"If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated
1445184550
in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
-7306922
him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders
1867600195
in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is
-1752409594
imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible.
-1466543034
Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little
706435689
friend, are you not?"
-1886284929

-1923438341
"I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
1922238265

-1923438341
"Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and
561181350
mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working
352218928
for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is
-1094516914
right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no
-801725674
light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and
-529661499
animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale,
1273898802
and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it
-74457977
is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too
232792227
have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am
1250797738
vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix
-1978518075
me at once."
-67264534

-1923438341
"If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
166069487
you are very safe."
-1471071153

-1923438341
"God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
1357610465

-1923438341
The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic
-966996605
seat.  Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood
-583708483
before him.
1602189631

-1923438341
"Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to
896324305
take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?"
-1532023191

-1923438341
I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
-640422077

-1923438341
"Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the
-358739215
flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
-41698355
young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their
-2143776375
first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to
197487230
suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and
868949339
not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying."
-2045920807

-1923438341
"No, sir; I am content."
1535054440

-1923438341
"Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a
-913674638
girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood
-1057005328
upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you
638604317
there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what
-333194228
motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and
-94158936
taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking
-666558644
of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the
936774435
perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what
-891760622
you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take
-246742296
measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor
-858646781
culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very
-2001289367
confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel
-1269946418
will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations
721084978
have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there,
590458434
seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless,
206054259
sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
822700855
Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary
1176927173
banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find
419253785
in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have
1146924784
sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all
-933103561
fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives,
646299631
regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer
-303709064
feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains
-1194884582
to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this
1399755120
end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere
1581694590
conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your
-1411787634
judgment approves?"
-462893958

-1923438341
He paused for an answer: and what was I to say?  Oh, for some good spirit
-1916271637
to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!  Vain aspiration!  The
-1301724530
west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its
810669602
breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their
1097181001
song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
553088341

-1923438341
Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
-1104769598

-1923438341
"Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
-809622127
justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
-441262875
ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
-1543255194
peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
-841815489

-1923438341
"Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should
641204682
never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers
701286012
falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has
1976932793
suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to
1625999657
amend and solace to heal."
1440924829

-1923438341
"But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the
1244945775
instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a
1185709125
worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the
-1641296935
instrument for my cure in--"
-1482308600

-1923438341
He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling.  I
-863919029
almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch the
1899737270
suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many minutes--so
-1814366559
long was the silence protracted.  At last I looked up at the tardy
-1386455885
speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
-885960300

-1923438341
"Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone--while his face changed
1875849305
too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh and
-647084910
sarcastic--"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't
907590109
you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?"
-32339397

-1923438341
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he
-1838902255
came back he was humming a tune.
-1535204247

-1923438341
"Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with your
-629521996
vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
148671737

-1923438341
"Curse you?  No, sir."
-1215594838

-1923438341
"Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were
-559164687
warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
-192484222
chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
1731266441

-1923438341
"Whenever I can be useful, sir."
-79589457

-1923438341
"For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be
-1235571606
able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To
631231662
you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her."
51852477

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
678518574

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just
-227448453
such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and
-987674081
Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."
-25191769

-1923438341
As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
-89428272
cheerfully--
-310781477

-1923438341
"Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise:
101452189
I rose at four to see him off."
2088664477

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXI
157006533

-1923438341

-1923438341
Presentiments are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are
1316191741
signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not
252409619
yet found the key.  I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because
68028301
I have had strange ones of my own.  Sympathies, I believe, exist (for
1943877067
instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives
-568244352
asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to
659876757
which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
1661680906
And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with
-522165448
man.
639530242

-1923438341
When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie
-178899818
Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little
1597433167
child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either
-513349117
to one's self or one's kin.  The saying might have worn out of my memory,
-1121863759
had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix
-1237490509
it there.  The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her
2016105241
little sister.
1421043550

-1923438341
Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during
-475516662
the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not
-1125196379
brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my
-134787711
arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with
235025188
daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.  It was
257685150
a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled
1185956139
close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition
1899346773
evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive
-1956985456
nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
-1257080735

-1923438341
I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one
-1469230217
image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the
577162356
vision drew near.  It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had
-1904301830
been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on
-1884099803
the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message
-1936271875
that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I
-326546188
found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's
1323450417
servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand
1839828107
was surrounded with a crape band.
-1474615744

-1923438341
"I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss," he said, rising as I entered;
-578846263
"but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at
282937169
Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still."
-1741660138

-1923438341
"Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give
705580849
me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You
1201398524
are married to Bessie?"
-66424890

-1923438341
"Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another
995197371
little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and
-1685863649
child are thriving."
-1931993779

-1923438341
"And are the family well at the house, Robert?"
-1390661340

-1923438341
"I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very
435679248
badly at present--in great trouble."
1937019545

-1923438341
"I hope no one is dead," I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too
1909701383
looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--
-1745075389

-1923438341
"Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London."
709492018

-1923438341
"Mr. John?"
-334198937

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"And how does his mother bear it?"
-616338465

-1923438341
"Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been
-465779927
very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and
1740453935
his death was shocking."
-732717142

-1923438341
"I heard from Bessie he was not doing well."
-2040606650

-1923438341
"Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate
77890067
amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into
632709350
jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he
1756776606
returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the
-48534088
knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came
-2138134483
down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all
753432831
to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his
-1899040280
extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was
-346857159
dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself."
-1316617343

-1923438341
I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--
1226690088

-1923438341
"Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very
387262039
stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of
-1143094820
poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's
1280286683
death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She
1102588697
was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather
1910654284
better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making
1222050426
signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,
1886845300
that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she
-1585735577
made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to
-10762161
her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means
1657236034
anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and
116807965
advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but
834464705
their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,
-1111942224
that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can
-741200148
get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow
1938441648
morning."
-164551705

-1923438341
"Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go."
-1528331396

-1923438341
"I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse:
-833473477
but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?"
-1894433986

-1923438341
"Yes; and I will do it now;" and having directed him to the servants'
403392917
hall, and recommended him to the care of John's wife, and the attentions
128203560
of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
-1311637169

-1923438341
He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the
640987656
stables, or the grounds.  I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;--yes:
2140953073
she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram.  To the billiard-
541555161
room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded
-930341657
thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their
-1761166252
admirers, were all busied in the game.  It required some courage to
74917516
disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not
-1132871016
defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram's side.
-988403866
She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to
-1250740467
demand, "What can the creeping creature want now?" and when I said, in a
899241857
low voice, "Mr. Rochester," she made a movement as if tempted to order me
1803004538
away.  I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and
-1088404308
very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure
1940607799
scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,
62111099
and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty
-1151828010
lineaments.
-1847162832

-1923438341
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.
-1663385205
Rochester turned to see who the "person" was.  He made a curious
-1048479595
grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his
-983604495
cue and followed me from the room.
-1479488387

-1923438341
"Well, Jane?" he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,
-794009644
which he had shut.
-1284628284

-1923438341
"If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two."
1256796024

-1923438341
"What to do?--where to go?"
-1140137709

-1923438341
"To see a sick lady who has sent for me."
1765124454

-1923438341
"What sick lady?--where does she live?"
1159184650

-1923438341
"At Gateshead; in ---shire."
1166827176

-1923438341
"-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for
-1197367128
people to see her that distance?"
527502517

-1923438341
"Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed."
82684796

-1923438341
"Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate."
-1217341463

-1923438341
"It is his widow, sir."
716156874

-1923438341
"And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?"
1121501813

-1923438341
"Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother."
-1435834104

-1923438341
"The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you
-1787753767
had no relations."
405251352

-1923438341
"None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me
984740710
off."
-571731425

-1923438341
"Why?"
-1873626783

-1923438341
"Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me."
-892827743

-1923438341
"But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was
-740319310
talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the
-1735950377
veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of
1136507524
the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago
-2071797036
in London."
-1755490924

-1923438341
"John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his
1702834520
family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked
-1232687957
his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack."
741881684

-1923438341
"And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of
-1992197067
running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead
1589404520
before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off."
1715774267

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very
-2023363653
different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now."
-104375193

-1923438341
"How long will you stay?"
383476688

-1923438341
"As short a time as possible, sir."
-2081718018

-1923438341
"Promise me only to stay a week--"
-1211883697

-1923438341
"I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it."
-554007989

-1923438341
"At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any
1246865593
pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?"
-1509476941

-1923438341
"Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well."
-581553092

-1923438341
"And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone."
-1799203325

-1923438341
"No, sir, she has sent her coachman."
-908429659

-1923438341
"A person to be trusted?"
2030705132

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family."
-1411343523

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester meditated.  "When do you wish to go?"
-1564956683

-1923438341
"Early to-morrow morning, sir."
246669101

-1923438341
"Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I
-781072342
daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have
979208564
you in the world, Jane?" he asked, smiling.
-1055115308

-1923438341
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  "Five shillings, sir."  He
1351307221
took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as
1376793501
if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here,"
1646133936
said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but
878945198
fifteen.  I told him I had no change.
885081384

-1923438341
"I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages."
-318550396

-1923438341
I declined accepting more than was my due.  He scowled at first; then, as
1199231580
if recollecting something, he said--
-1282661392

-1923438341
"Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay
1667578707
away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not
1634915214
plenty?"
-989058252

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, but now you owe me five."
1979956320

-1923438341
"Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds."
788598049

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you
1872071042
while I have the opportunity."
-485801452

-1923438341
"Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it."
518285286

-1923438341
"You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be
-348869905
married?"
-252895241

-1923438341
"Yes; what then?"
-591432366

-1923438341
"In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will
-764742580
perceive the necessity of it."
-975584257

-1923438341
"To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her
-2022981726
rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of
-1781002210
it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march
972257630
straight to--the devil?"
-1811050323

-1923438341
"I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere."
-697597978

-1923438341
"In course!" he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of
-174979346
features equally fantastic and ludicrous.  He looked at me some minutes.
-661744238

-1923438341
"And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by
1531642911
you to seek a place, I suppose?"
-359897907

-1923438341
"No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in
208761981
asking favours of them--but I shall advertise."
1641631049

-1923438341
"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!" he growled.  "At your peril
-1501131095
you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten
-1164254641
pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
574838497

-1923438341
"And so have I, sir," I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind
-1189682878
me.  "I could not spare the money on any account."
131467528

-1923438341
"Little niggard!" said he, "refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me
-206087383
five pounds, Jane."
-407810972

-1923438341
"Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence."
840782896

-1923438341
"Just let me look at the cash."
1418437544

-1923438341
"No, sir; you are not to be trusted."
-15111259

-1923438341
"Jane!"
-1019869867

-1923438341
"Sir?"
-1350564325

-1923438341
"Promise me one thing."
-431197856

-1923438341
"I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform."
-894948470

-1923438341
"Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll
1655612060
find you one in time."
-508445144

-1923438341
"I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I
-184190931
and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters
-1889439418
it."
-74381758

-1923438341
"Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow,
-1988190574
then?"
-1655314828

-1923438341
"Yes, sir; early."
816951421

-1923438341
"Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?"
1136648795

-1923438341
"No, sir, I must prepare for the journey."
1540578838

-1923438341
"Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?"
-156342090

-1923438341
"I suppose so, sir."
-399048312

-1923438341
"And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm
1538616162
not quite up to it."
2073223428

-1923438341
"They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer."
-94589054

-1923438341
"Then say it."
-1413962435

-1923438341
"Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present."
-2018753078

-1923438341
"What must I say?"
-133166943

-1923438341
"The same, if you like, sir."
194148921

-1923438341
"Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?"
224631275

-1923438341
"Yes?"
-522759316

-1923438341
"It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like
1886871026
something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for
953395725
instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more
2017458489
than say Farewell, Jane?"
335655627

-1923438341
"It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word
162155588
as in many."
-536557946

-1923438341
"Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'"
-268271317

-1923438341
"How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?" I asked
485009985
myself; "I want to commence my packing."  The dinner-bell rang, and
-1159002815
suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more
-183269917
during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
1641177821

-1923438341
I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of
179020067
the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was
1351213830
very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white
610022263
curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished
-957218673
bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her
-2022052832
last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.
767363526

-1923438341
"Bless you!--I knew you would come!" exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.
-891200153

-1923438341
"Yes, Bessie," said I, after I had kissed her; "and I trust I am not too
-512394702
late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope."
245433867

-1923438341
"Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The
-474735048
doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she
-1969680467
will finally recover."
-2096048083

-1923438341
"Has she mentioned me lately?"
335582158

-1923438341
"She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,
-275357183
but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the
302148717
house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and
-1430946429
wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,
-512162689
and then I will go up with you?"
-1963832149

-1923438341
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and
-1103856076
went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet
-678782061
and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to
-1607251827
accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling
-450268724
garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.
1038308561

-1923438341
Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting
-2101703420
out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting
-281349873
a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an
823432542
occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.
970565002
Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good
-1044015388
looks.
1728187882

-1923438341
Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit
1633873644
still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the
1242419960
fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my
2042945355
cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with
-831597162
some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and
738455643
obeyed her as in bygone days.
-1098519498

-1923438341
She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a
330526985
person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,
-1764303363
whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was
-2034177425
rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,
21450960
and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company
-951434560
that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie
1458067112
listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.
-2131577870

-1923438341
In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my
1650629460
bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.
798884041
It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked
117044136
down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in
1462166290
January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered
1656616147
heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly
-1550955728
harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same
2127150250
hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;
424544698
and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of
-978461863
the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,
847826791
and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,
-1439465169
too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.
1567571916

-1923438341
"You shall go into the breakfast-room first," said Bessie, as she
1988137420
preceded me through the hall; "the young ladies will be there."
916514520

-1923438341
In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article
1631646161
of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced
-1091068594
to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the
1099985921
hearth.  Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two
2099275320
volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third
-786986553
shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
-481207598
The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered
382888883
past recognition.
1453059290

-1923438341
Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as
-590470427
Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.  There
-1038156108
was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme
-1051717121
plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen
278612421
collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a
818594130
string of ebony beads and a crucifix.  This I felt sure was Eliza, though
1499472250
I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and
-383296052
colourless visage.
1419651616

-1923438341
The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I
276464471
remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.  This was a
626620361
full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular
1106821863
features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.  The hue of
768305512
her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her
-298871851
sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the
856728554
other's looked puritanical.
-1100917695

-1923438341
In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one;
-280581446
the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent's Cairngorm eye: the
-1627930833
blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and
664608687
chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable
2134926774
hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
821780899

-1923438341
Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by
1503948385
the name of "Miss Eyre."  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,
-312764153
abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her
1882160250
eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her "How
-393057591
d'ye do?" several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,
-793637216
uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances
1995260758
that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab
-313248879
merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage
-866307247
bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they
-1144488799
think you a "quiz" without actually saying the words.  A certain
719733011
superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,
-1979203209
express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by
1261610308
any positive rudeness in word or deed.
1048328391

-1923438341
A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power
326635406
over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised
305654617
to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-
436447263
sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana
853067916
ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the
1253417818
last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than
45676871
any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and
-1292570011
exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or
-931020635
bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
630657226

-1923438341
"How is Mrs. Reed?" I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who
-820918282
thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected
-777073224
liberty.
912397671

-1923438341
"Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you
1353122466
can see her to-night."
1735542529

-1923438341
"If," said I, "you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I
-313608603
should be much obliged to you."
1986462010

-1923438341
Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  "I
-693416958
know she had a particular wish to see me," I added, "and I would not
-1913673783
defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary."
1292367338

-1923438341
"Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening," remarked Eliza.  I soon
1456662344
rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would
666858279
just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask
-2145741399
her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-
-1327003452
night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,
1089600523
I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit
-316947547
always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,
-1821331085
a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,
30445020
it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I
1275762957
had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay
1508101403
with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or
972365492
folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I
-1555157639
addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should
-401844165
probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my
259282170
chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
1722115317

-1923438341
"Missis is awake," said she; "I have told her you are here: come and let
1893086290
us see if she will know you."
954844791

-1923438341
I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so
1312149587
often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I
1365129171
hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on
1977096762
the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post
-109195458
bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,
377499522
and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to
1469900807
kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a
1333951349
certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once
-1959517714
dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and
360110435
lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened
28267866
the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
-909695680

-1923438341
Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar
1521158691
image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance
-463536338
and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in
-877716539
bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion
696704451
than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to
159161647
forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in
-1630630523
amity.
1620332887

-1923438341
The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that
-2101639651
peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,
253062871
imperious, despotic eyebrow.  How often had it lowered on me menace and
981795099
hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived
-654446126
as I traced its harsh line now!  And yet I stooped down and kissed her:
-1517535403
she looked at me.
1816105986

-1923438341
"Is this Jane Eyre?" she said.
734228341

-1923438341
"Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?"
-2081841190

-1923438341
I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no
-1681875961
sin to forget and break that vow now.  My fingers had fastened on her
1098592889
hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should
763288715
at that moment have experienced true pleasure.  But unimpressionable
1994296840
natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily
1908372708
eradicated.  Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather
-1986973646
from me, she remarked that the night was warm.  Again she regarded me so
1014586950
icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was
204586641
unchanged and unchangeable.  I knew by her stony eye--opaque to
435982017
tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she was resolved to consider me
1273946702
bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous
1114923343
pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
-1106414662

-1923438341
I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to
-1339729707
subdue her--to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.
-356731646
My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their
-1417131800
source.  I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over
1261581477
the pillow.
-506481737

-1923438341
"You sent for me," I said, "and I am here; and it is my intention to stay
-897160104
till I see how you get on."
-1997439351

-1923438341
"Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?"
-976748522

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things
-602875506
over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a
395566388
difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to
1815345792
say--let me see--"
-1484288241

-1923438341
The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place
-184171143
in her once vigorous frame.  Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes
-1579777314
round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she
-125180555
was at once irritated.
-790678998

-1923438341
"Sit up!" said she; "don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are
-975857288
you Jane Eyre?"
-1174774933

-1923438341
"I am Jane Eyre."
-1672617748

-1923438341
"I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such
-1399639356
a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,
448885838
daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden
449715118
starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's
-1423295527
movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a
597942093
fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her
-1439129071
away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever
-862269747
broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:
223311418
but I said she did--I wish she had died!"
-1529487687

-1923438341
"A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?"
-1428462387

-1923438341
"I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only
-266641509
sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning
-832178726
her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he
-80877981
wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated
-1841522186
him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated
536159672
it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
2010917930
It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like
-465333918
any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used
1602419078
to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than
-1219498068
he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children
-2093885304
friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was
1055847477
angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he
535610934
had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he
2101145490
died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been
619013915
charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally
1626015177
weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it:
1405959219
John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish
-881201952
he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more
-1230675346
money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the
-1004148069
servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never
525671097
submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income
791745243
goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and
1874654873
always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and
1090913238
degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him."
1142316568

-1923438341
She was getting much excited.  "I think I had better leave her now," said
-946646971
I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
335728581

-1923438341
"Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in
1111672790
the morning she is calmer."
-898216588

-1923438341
I rose.  "Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to
-628303324
say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or
-1344801482
mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in
1727517431
his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange
-1703310711
pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be
-1182178909
had?"
1475748404

-1923438341
Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she
-708685901
succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and
1422642559
sank into a dozing state.  I then left her.
1182957743

-1923438341
More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her.
633675994
She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade
902562725
everything which could painfully excite her.  Meantime, I got on as well
-451073195
as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.  They were very cold, indeed, at
-625110781
first.  Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and
-869151412
scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.  Georgiana would
-525095841
chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of
-1961945508
me.  But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or
-945822968
amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me
252644969
for both.
435707431

-1923438341
Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take
-1351144541
a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching
1779186539
fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to
-217667743
shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse
917549464
of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk;
-361189567
a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus-
-804142147
flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest,
1384798337
under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
863372345

-1923438341
One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be,
-1496199029
I did not care or know.  I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad
-1279161548
point, and worked away.  Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and
-2069320281
prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour
-683569525
gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
614125105
Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then
-1399473590
followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full
-1217917114
nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm
-258158842
chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black
682679143
whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and
1159426936
waved above the forehead.  Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last,
564415454
because they required the most careful working.  I drew them large; I
2121183247
shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids
-414377423
lustrous and large.  "Good! but not quite the thing," I thought, as I
-1755820215
surveyed the effect: "they want more force and spirit;" and I wrought the
1594286468
shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy
1285491313
touch or two secured success.  There, I had a friend's face under my
-107118982
gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs
-23366300
on me?  I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed
-761154498
and content.
-588976247

-1923438341
"Is that a portrait of some one you know?" asked Eliza, who had
770338939
approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,
-647647218
and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in
1133444484
fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that
-85974738
to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The
1995410875
other drawings pleased her much, but she called that "an ugly man." They
1304782183
both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;
1766901474
and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her
-586847972
album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at
1942196320
once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we
-433876677
had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she
698103009
had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent
-1321093017
in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the
-1478632408
attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest
239163552
she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints
-1631909714
were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and
1298272421
sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of
-1137460258
fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The
1351628407
communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same
1589840267
theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once
-1887956156
adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the
-1120479194
present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly
-364138522
taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after
442363612
dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her
-283768234
mother's sick-room, and no more.
820177433

-1923438341
Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw
2110696736
a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what
168006016
she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an
-294382363
alarm to call her up early.  I know not how she occupied herself before
1165492359
breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular
-1494987490
portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she
1967550966
studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer
-506272556
Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and
-1454748359
she said, "the Rubric."  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold
-1088577268
thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a
-1702933338
carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she
-648682896
informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately
-859713188
erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to
681933764
working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of
1689060821
her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe
1761258525
she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing
403777935
annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to
1665140271
vary its clockwork regularity.
1741328412

-1923438341
She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than
797477870
usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had
-1100127248
been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,
-1357973741
settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had
1890719925
taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly
785045898
improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or
61457151
linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a
423318322
retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from
-452071262
disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous
1001099019
world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.
105661870

-1923438341
"Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had
-1592237080
had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.
-177170127
Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers."
1960209892

-1923438341
Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time
1365251348
in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and
-421995639
wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an
-1589009691
invitation up to town.  "It would be so much better," she said, "if she
-551376690
could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over."  I
-2041323640
did not ask what she meant by "all being over," but I suppose she
-1057088448
referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of
1919832449
funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's
1019217431
indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had
-1478238328
been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and
46445730
unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
407860394

-1923438341
"Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never
1558982257
allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make
342304372
no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a
-1663690286
reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some
1509319488
other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or
-502955656
himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you
1183313925
are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must
1985655790
be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a
1055388570
dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be
-669436834
flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,
1672949467
you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you
-2146834109
independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day;
4441235
share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no
208363627
stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include
-697919073
all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid
-721298351
regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;
604758531
and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant
-2113649817
moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,
1530904556
forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to
1847628311
do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you
1996503505
will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as
-194280221
heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your
-50245890
idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this
-465755572
plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now
-955637437
about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I
1216943555
wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in
1463366848
Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known
19599018
each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the
1974191609
same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest
-1136956575
claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted,
-1361742647
were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you
-705742563
in the old world, and betake myself to the new."
1568163625

-1923438341
She closed her lips.
-988394583

-1923438341
"You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,"
-1488557242
answered Georgiana.  "Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless
159615207
creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I
420543287
have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord
-1815554859
Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a
-1648436586
title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and
177261493
so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever."
618735609
Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour
1206761771
afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
235404326

-1923438341
True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were
-661182680
two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably
1968571412
savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy
1142167323
draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and
-1147582314
husky a morsel for human deglutition.
961639692

-1923438341
It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa
225138728
over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day
1676386671
service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid
-13327045
formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she
-280839095
considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice
-1791638806
every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
195616796

-1923438341
I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who
-1726014543
lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent
1421154707
attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of
-1620537804
the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own
2051181197
family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found
17469725
the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the
166880815
patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the
-1844437532
pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,
631071020
re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on
-1643513195
me, and then I moved away to the window.
-1280129128

-1923438341
The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
-1574459522
"One lies there," I thought, "who will soon be beyond the war of earthly
-689704879
elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material
-390390763
tenement--flit when at length released?"
1200152572

-1923438341
In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her
1868170237
dying words--her faith--her doctrine of the equality of disembodied
-696016504
souls.  I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered
-886551087
tones--still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and
1050482033
sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her
883155193
longing to be restored to her divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice
2083038997
murmured from the couch behind: "Who is that?"
74765837

-1923438341
I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving?  I went up to
925201209
her.
-1520704703

-1923438341
"It is I, Aunt Reed."
-1819300901

-1923438341
"Who--I?" was her answer.  "Who are you?" looking at me with surprise and
-663324822
a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  "You are quite a stranger to
1413210528
me--where is Bessie?"
-1381853886

-1923438341
"She is at the lodge, aunt."
549198341

-1923438341
"Aunt," she repeated.  "Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the
-1237080636
Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are
990594233
quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!"
-482085554

-1923438341
I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my
1999300688
identity.
551984038

-1923438341
"Yet," said she, "I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I
-982570236
wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:
-2097379958
besides, in eight years she must be so changed."  I now gently assured
-926002780
her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing
-1842431397
that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I
-924781666
explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
1944392326

-1923438341
"I am very ill, I know," she said ere long.  "I was trying to turn myself
391592457
a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I
706482657
should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health,
1277085208
burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here?
-1031233916
or is there no one in the room but you?"
-1668966945

-1923438341
I assured her we were alone.
-1563226181

-1923438341
"Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in
-239201653
breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own
-1382538772
child; the other--" she stopped.  "After all, it is of no great
-945798339
importance, perhaps," she murmured to herself: "and then I may get
184727575
better; and to humble myself so to her is painful."
2045621584

-1923438341
She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;
1799184420
she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,
62664676
of the last pang.
-270454417

-1923438341
"Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell
1675014591
her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see
1639774970
there."
1659317586

-1923438341
I obeyed her directions.  "Read the letter," she said.
-1481757144

-1923438341
It was short, and thus conceived:--
-265843046

-1923438341
   "Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my
-1318705950
   niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to
1357166829
   write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has
857800120
   blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried
-1419934238
   and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at
1027629065
   my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,
1335893788

-1923438341
   "JOHN EYRE, Madeira."
849025539

-1923438341
It was dated three years back.
-653018943

-1923438341
"Why did I never hear of this?" I asked.
141048866

-1923438341
"Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in
-1705764837
lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me,
1176770783
Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you
-1221508694
declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the
-2017189235
unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought
-1297530549
of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable
-1189507078
cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up
-1305016276
and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I
-30736491
had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in
45993058
a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!"
-1184231941

-1923438341
"Dear Mrs. Reed," said I, as I offered her the draught she required,
-375090039
"think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me
1861054996
for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have
-768795658
passed since that day."
-1727918610

-1923438341
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and
-452737014
drawn breath, she went on thus--
-885665072

-1923438341
"I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be
2026331594
adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was
1711706932
what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his
185989999
disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at
1422178442
Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose
-1536899952
my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my
-150622606
torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but
-1936611210
for you, I should never have been tempted to commit."
2029420243

-1923438341
"If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to
-1963866406
regard me with kindness and forgiveness"
1248400758

-1923438341
"You have a very bad disposition," said she, "and one to this day I feel
347364927
it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and
-294010478
quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and
-312880604
violence, I can never comprehend."
-1976049328

-1923438341
"My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not
832719056
vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to
925916978
love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled
924036810
to you now: kiss me, aunt."
1884697681

-1923438341
I approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it.  She said I
-1041445022
oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water.  As I
1943057366
laid her down--for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she
-227731960
drank--I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble
233439777
fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
123261705

-1923438341
"Love me, then, or hate me, as you will," I said at last, "you have my
1986475231
full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace."
-2055390409

-1923438341
Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to
-419485951
change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me--dying,
-664830948
she must hate me still.
-165885373

-1923438341
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.  I yet lingered half-an-hour
1572814471
longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was
-83371596
fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve
1661110270
o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor
-92702661
were either of her daughters.  They came to tell us the next morning that
684480318
all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look
309156928
at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared
505778976
not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,
-333334744
rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow
627344855
and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange
1994853335
and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and
-1443639688
pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or
-118437919
subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_
518511900
loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a
862975678
form.
-778139438

-1923438341
Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she
243011
observed--
-1480136703

-1923438341
"With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life
-1641743817
was shortened by trouble."  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an
-1767183932
instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.
610533433
Neither of us had dropt a tear.
-12625369

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXII
-1555958848

-1923438341

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
-1454622803
elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.  I wished to leave immediately after
790426459
the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off to
-501422708
London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr. Gibson, who
-1752331341
had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle the family
1983446438
affairs.  Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from
1652336077
her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in her fears, nor
-42103318
aid in her preparations; so I bore with her feeble-minded wailings and
369853448
selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for
-1888466598
her and packing her dresses.  It is true, that while I worked, she would
-1834963192
idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I were destined to live always
-1378393333
together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I
417078623
should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should
-741179329
assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else
-1781709173
it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of
-659326780
those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It
-753165941
is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes
-763250428
at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so
-872569730
patient and compliant on my part."
-1045619484

-1923438341
At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to
290844275
stay another week.  Her plans required all her time and attention, she
-454644914
said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long
-290421756
she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling trunks,
2012861698
emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any
-1601857674
one.  She wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer
-95113557
notes of condolence.
-293256985

-1923438341
One morning she told me I was at liberty.  "And," she added, "I am
1424306870
obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is
762141345
some difference between living with such an one as you and with
-640303271
Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
-1524698845
To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up
-695481282
my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it;
-2075885868
there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time
1105618231
to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study
1208670636
of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it
1385373547
is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently
-597771303
and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the
1884817880
veil."
-1720175325

-1923438341
I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade
453339039
her from it.  "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought: "much
1855497849
good may it do you!"
-1933882982

-1923438341
When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
2144866127
you have some sense."
1711336521

-1923438341
I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
-212333534
have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
214190524
convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
-679582373
much care."
-878891276

-1923438341
"You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
-1412188973
separate way.  As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or her
552442992
sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
-705339285
advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza
1064527390
actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where
1811624050
she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she endowed with her
1256004058
fortune.
-1291488737

-1923438341
How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
-1649911281
short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.  I had
-344835747
known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
-1661923789
walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to
1096438476
come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good
-1070779137
fire, and to be unable to get either.  Neither of these returnings was
-1503003175
very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
-1229243959
increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.  The return
-215091092
to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
-1393435428

-1923438341
My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
-541567486
spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day.  During the first twelve hours
1995292789
I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured and
2070454227
discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice.  I mused on the
912354044
funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
1090718936
servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent
-1961189200
church, the solemn service.  Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
1421487790
beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent
-260996088
cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person
-1084033489
and character.  The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these
1211759252
thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's
-309949744
bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
430627609

-1923438341
I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?  Not
-1904843445
long; of that I was sure.  I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
330775365
of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
86860194
left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in a
483040560
fortnight.  Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements
-1287775058
for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said
731662013
the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but
1090988133
from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could
-664017497
no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.  "You would be
2035020141
strangely incredulous if you did doubt it," was my mental comment.  "I
-716231891
don't doubt it."
650584578

-1923438341
The question followed, "Where was I to go?"  I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
-1573407655
the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
661517040
Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester
-1578175763
looked on with his arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at
-1742185155
both her and me.
1241113369

-1923438341
I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did
-237350628
not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.  I proposed to
670535471
walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my
-1207792548
box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six
-748279053
o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road
1139591772
which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
1412903716

-1923438341
It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the
791934294
haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from
1315552237
cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue
-1195121259
was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
1054865836
The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if
1078135266
there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled
-1800476416
vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
-2113026442

-1923438341
I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once
-183169864
to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not
-1221002877
to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place
935421592
where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.  "Mrs.
-431001483
Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and little
885439674
Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you
-1708817424
are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you."
32566568

-1923438341
But what is so headstrong as youth?  What so blind as inexperience?  These
1149977434
affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again
-1269368396
looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and they
-995165097
added--"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or
-67793752
weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!"  And then I
1453544537
strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade
1001729236
myself to own and rear--and ran on.
-850315392

-1923438341
They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers
1858058548
are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on
-1870456068
their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.  I have but a field or two to
-1509334495
traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.  How full
-1291216100
the hedges are of roses!  But I have no time to gather any; I want to be
1265224483
at the house.  I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches
-696809835
across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
620406374
Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his hand; he is writing.
-327504053

-1923438341
Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment
1289625693
I am beyond my own mastery.  What does it mean?  I did not think I should
848549091
tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the power of
-1829329476
motion in his presence.  I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not
-1381870610
make an absolute fool of myself.  I know another way to the house.  It
127205957
does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
-102843575

-1923438341
"Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil.  "There you
1249383389
are!  Come on, if you please."
-654628172

-1923438341
I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely
1033513321
cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above
1710492386
all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel
512890047
insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved
348525883
to conceal.  But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to
2134918076
behave with decent composure.
-601254975

-1923438341
"And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
-1160902129
Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
1862552318
clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
1592703888
the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
-880883125
dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
-728741694
month?"
-358073423

-1923438341
"I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
-871902779

-1923438341
"A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other
-1740082894
world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
-507162765
meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
693611361
if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take
788259698
hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!" he
-1111962092
added, when he had paused an instant.  "Absent from me a whole month, and
795606202
forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
-953797809

-1923438341
I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
-1836965235
broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
473124467
the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
379783423
Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
-1737891065
communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered to
484307478
stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.  His last words
746521128
were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him whether
1980432652
I forgot him or not.  And he had spoken of Thornfield as my home--would
-696662752
that it were my home!
-1947984404

-1923438341
He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.  I
-353414571
inquired soon if he had not been to London.
-1398134232

-1923438341
"Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
1807584857

-1923438341
"Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
-75496168

-1923438341
"And did she inform you what I went to do?"
-1434820349

-1923438341
"Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand."
1651494602

-1923438341
"You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will
1032615829
suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
611449124
Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I
-38402222
were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now,
-1124925367
fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
-550607487
of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
1117137816

-1923438341
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A
-599023154
loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or
-1923560151
rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
50860338

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
329968866
me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
1523172833
abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had of
1658051251
his own, and which he used but on rare occasions.  He seemed to think it
411502720
too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he
-964080271
shed it over me now.
-706247912

-1923438341
"Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
1798224512
home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold."
1840300970

-1923438341
All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
-1868169768
colloquise further.  I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
-1223433131
leave him calmly.  An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.  I
83536998
said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me--
1163414287

-1923438341
"Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad
-300162815
to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home."
494971818

-1923438341
I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
-929313629
tried.  Little Adele was half wild with delight when she saw me.  Mrs.
-1162852075
Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness.  Leah smiled, and
-964766435
even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee.  This was very pleasant; there
1657628739
is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
-425115530
feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
339162489

-1923438341
I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
1803210438
ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming
-1387253014
grief.  When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I
-1564632496
had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had
-178819633
nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to
915900860
surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that
-225310148
we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr.
1935932018
Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take
992949868
pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he
-30997876
supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
475149828
daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa
1437341225
petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after
1267157683
his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
-1859624664
protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
877445244

-1923438341
A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
-1853668427
Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going
827145630
on for such an event.  Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had
-153689301
yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the negative.  Once
1771335843
she said she had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he
-721025412
was going to bring his bride home; but he had answered her only by a joke
1401497981
and one of his queer looks, and she could not tell what to make of him.
-912670151

-1923438341
One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings
-873105357
backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty
-69380937
miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance
1947648485
to an ardent lover?  To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr.
-95710598
Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride.  I began to cherish hopes I
-1555080602
had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had
1947957297
been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.  I used
1689992215
to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could
1019222482
not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or
1137141391
evil feelings.  If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I
-803978388
lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.
27951627
Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder
-1295027041
to me when there--and, alas! never had I loved him so well.
1876880407

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXIII
422742997

-1923438341

-1923438341
A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
2079991446
as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-
463527101
girt land.  It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South,
-1144116569
like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the
-2045700078
cliffs of Albion.  The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield
-1516748939
were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their
-1322146040
dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted
-1629396086
well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
1118177557

-1923438341
On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
1533688613
Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.  I watched her drop
1497477196
asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
1357043873

-1923438341
It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--"Day its fervid fires
892315275
had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
1838992251
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of
-1214058575
clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
1830796413
furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
-1138233314
wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.  The east had its own
-1161770870
charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary
-765184435
star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.
-2068164102

-1923438341
I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of
1235053601
a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
-144319386
handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
-772416617
orchard.  No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
1682404208
was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out
-1895478544
from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it
1006177970
from the lawn.  At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from
2029005966
lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a
1419221997
giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the
-2016755467
fence.  Here one could wander unseen.  While such honey-dew fell, such
450960180
silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such
1027791307
shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the
-35773329
upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising
-199864488
moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not
-672635817
by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
-1447232944

-1923438341
Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
-2040432419
yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of
1880413812
shrub nor flower; it is--I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.  I
675326102
look round and I listen.  I see trees laden with ripening fruit.  I hear
-1818578793
a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is
-1648268618
visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
112075025
I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester
-603477280
entering.  I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he
-653059105
will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.
1448595754

-1923438341
But no--eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
926941533
as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
-519223413
branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden;
1881803077
now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of
1001979832
flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on
2088619889
their petals.  A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at
1326910855
Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine it.
-494723842

-1923438341
"Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
-854980033
perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
593827194

-1923438341
I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might
142020282
not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant
-112128274
from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him.  "I shall get
-1798425023
by very well," I meditated.  As I crossed his shadow, thrown long over
-474395305
the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly, without
-1767316160
turning--
-397260470

-1923438341
"Jane, come and look at this fellow."
-2038902795

-1923438341
I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind--could his shadow feel?  I
-905248790
started at first, and then I approached him.
625709572

-1923438341
"Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
766096463
insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England;
-1414904329
there! he is flown."
108435421

-1923438341
The moth roamed away.  I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
1606359083
Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said--
1340460578

-1923438341
"Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
-1570854607
surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with
1443206039
moonrise."
-1160879000

-1923438341
It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough
-132607039
at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an
432318684
excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or
-2076878401
plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
1717778526
embarrassment.  I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
1803677085
Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege
956670221
for leaving him.  I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent
339729899
on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself looked so composed
1122646227
and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if
1494809959
evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his
1400567100
mind was unconscious and quiet.
1673080162

-1923438341
"Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed
-169864428
down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
1946532234
"Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
954088844

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who
1627668959
have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
-347019515
Adhesiveness?"
1071086482

-1923438341
"I am attached to it, indeed."
348500744

-1923438341
"And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a
1203895945
degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for
-794966596
simple dame Fairfax?"
336466185

-1923438341
"Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
926490271

-1923438341
"And would be sorry to part with them?"
-76058144

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused.  "It is always the way of events
713234956
in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled in
1926274043
a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move
2119841837
on, for the hour of repose is expired."
-1620975996

-1923438341
"Must I move on, sir?" I asked.  "Must I leave Thornfield?"
-612230261

-1923438341
"I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
-1140403466
must."
2089463614

-1923438341
This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
-1859965999

-1923438341
"Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
-236332889

-1923438341
"It is come now--I must give it to-night."
1655721555

-1923438341
"Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
-1059522902

-1923438341
"Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail
-988731608
straight on the head."
38111367

-1923438341
"Soon, sir?"
-1102249971

-1923438341
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
-1429952733
time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
-1005087049
put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy
756929765
estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an
1951736308
extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of
-745189475
such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was
1344431175
saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after
1064772441
more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away
1623647909
home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with
117902597
that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and
1011965770
humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in
-1418295425
case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot
-382417522
forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on
-906422537
the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll
-1535428849
try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I
1207659912
have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss
-126944638
Eyre, must get a new situation."
-96976152

-1923438341
"Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--" I was
149408599
going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to
-1887757278
betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long
-1296834402
sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
-1255877570

-1923438341
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
1674036229
"and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum
568594145
for you."
420384552

-1923438341
"Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--"
-848542591

-1923438341
"Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her
611660711
duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
-2066793068
employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed
-2039338330
I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I
-1692698750
think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters
416193626
of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll
-1132682133
like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say."
-828552431

-1923438341
"It is a long way off, sir."
-1789495323

-1923438341
"No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
414151662
distance."
2040314986

-1923438341
"Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--"
-1671259165

-1923438341
"From what, Jane?"
1818527358

-1923438341
"From England and from Thornfield: and--"
69054778

-1923438341
"Well?"
799921855

-1923438341
"From _you_, sir."
-1304727892

-1923438341
I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
424501216
will, my tears gushed out.  I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
-1829138824
avoided sobbing.  The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
-1678008174
cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
-1128067351
destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I
-1481544320
now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth,
338827777
caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
-515909285
loved.
1646903347

-1923438341
"It is a long way," I again said.
-768725368

-1923438341
"It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
776074672
Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I
-1540218308
never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
-493759032
country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
-1784403593

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
-950161381
little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk
-306817337
over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
1958201657
stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
-1229697465
chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit
659627225
there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
1861930439
there together."  He seated me and himself.
1845028170

-1923438341
"It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
1830087929
friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
2106265130
helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
307953788

-1923438341
I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
1824161064

-1923438341
"Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
1615078940
you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
255911501
somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
-1280342943
similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
1893469294
frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
1133008289
land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
1058404146
snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
2128209403
As for you,--you'd forget me."
-2074972680

-1923438341
"That I _never_ should, sir: you know--"  Impossible to proceed.
1868898285

-1923438341
"Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!"
-693551308

-1923438341
In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
432820074
no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
-554689799
with acute distress.  When I did speak, it was only to express an
-1633189984
impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
-920815939

-1923438341
"Because you are sorry to leave it?"
-1105923161

-1923438341
The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
-983661915
claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to
1592132117
predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to
-1070158222
speak.
-1500156061

-1923438341
"I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I
1858553468
have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I
-699896787
have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been
1994297833
buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion
61483468
with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face,
-1967081518
with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a
-398758283
vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it
-215270935
strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from
237992022
you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking
-641983014
on the necessity of death."
1284463467

-1923438341
"Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
1784069531

-1923438341
"Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me."
-1015423153

-1923438341
"In what shape?"
-2088524520

-1923438341
"In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride."
261003121

-1923438341
"My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!"
-416037086

-1923438341
"But you will have."
-417896826

-1923438341
"Yes;--I will!--I will!"  He set his teeth.
1102776445

-1923438341
"Then I must go:--you have said it yourself."
201298936

-1923438341
"No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept."
-1445341985

-1923438341
"I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.  "Do
1045688152
you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an
-119836904
automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of
-1834587748
bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my
224391675
cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am
-426381317
soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as
1699901225
you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty
1263320247
and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it
-1825967440
is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the
2145029739
medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my
-286737239
spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the
519605441
grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!"
2112846748

-1923438341
"As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester--"so," he added, enclosing me in his
-1285428164
arms.  Gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
1334445509
Jane!"
348687135

-1923438341
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or
-1521082688
as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with
-1134514061
whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I
-2089810979
have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union:
672383991
therefore I am better than you--let me go!"
1955893890

-1923438341
"Where, Jane?  To Ireland?"
455239660

-1923438341
"Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
-481724598

-1923438341
"Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
-850807303
rending its own plumage in its desperation."
7396491

-1923438341
"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
1712378898
independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
-354269163

-1923438341
Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
-1644938255

-1923438341
"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand,
-1695362763
my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
-1278000804

-1923438341
"You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
-177106969

-1923438341
"I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and
-1815078308
best earthly companion."
-96057723

-1923438341
"For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it."
-57561516

-1923438341
"Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
-293861364
too."
449315874

-1923438341
A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
1492364748
the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite
-1855706002
distance--it died.  The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
-1438535254
hour: in listening to it, I again wept.  Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking
-49117993
at me gently and seriously.  Some time passed before he spoke; he at last
1432962190
said--
-476569688

-1923438341
"Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
153357966

-1923438341
"I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
-1625529179
return."
-259896153

-1923438341
"But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
1816842373

-1923438341
I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
-462385929

-1923438341
"Come, Jane--come hither."
-1462008010

-1923438341
"Your bride stands between us."
1406963037

-1923438341
He rose, and with a stride reached me.
1355723370

-1923438341
"My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
875582312
is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?"
46552142

-1923438341
Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for I
1602855801
was still incredulous.
1919036027

-1923438341
"Do you doubt me, Jane?"
1651987281

-1923438341
"Entirely."
-1278883456

-1923438341
"You have no faith in me?"
1642132696

-1923438341
"Not a whit."
-1286637745

-1923438341
"Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately.  "Little sceptic, you
-1762928623
_shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that
192809203
you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to
-743684332
prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of
1559900819
what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result;
296830100
it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could
-275729051
not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I
-1998014022
love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you
-573167179
are--I entreat to accept me as a husband."
404423093

-1923438341
"What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness--and especially in
431145232
his incivility--to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in the
1005522320
world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have
-189712452
given me?"
7322697

-1923438341
"You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be
-2133427780
mine?  Say yes, quickly."
1880809941

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
1308154902

-1923438341
"Why?"
-1873626783

-1923438341
"Because I want to read your countenance--turn!"
1596801278

-1923438341
"There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched
1942762359
page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
-1636031053

-1923438341
His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
-1159827746
strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
568552289

-1923438341
"Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed.  "With that searching and yet
-704273082
faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
607615769

-1923438341
"How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only
138282458
feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
1159093618

-1923438341
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly.
-223677678
Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
805509445

-1923438341
"Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to
300902348
be your wife?"
1780651432

-1923438341
"I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
1104453572

-1923438341
"Then, sir, I will marry you."
-113910487

-1923438341
"Edward--my little wife!"
-1747886588

-1923438341
"Dear Edward!"
667257849

-1923438341
"Come to me--come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his deepest
-1407760903
tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make my
362609832
happiness--I will make yours."
-761743851

-1923438341
"God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
706549180
have her, and will hold her."
-649669230

-1923438341
"There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere."
647123436

-1923438341
"No--that is the best of it," he said.  And if I had loved him less I
-1148702737
should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
-842239545
sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the
-1432761511
paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
1969342984
abundant a flow.  Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?"  And
-1051761125
again and again I answered, "Yes."  After which he murmured, "It will
-1008646760
atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
1411908688
comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there
578316984
not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at
-404000912
God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's
-957757706
judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it."
255181330

-1923438341
But what had befallen the night?  The moon was not yet set, and we were
567193423
all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.  And
2020451483
what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared
1834410284
in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
1792785037

-1923438341
"We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes.  I could have
-230191504
sat with thee till morning, Jane."
1216012971

-1923438341
"And so," thought I, "could I with you."  I should have said so, perhaps,
652296849
but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and
-793039554
there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only
-2109494657
of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
-1975059122

-1923438341
The rain rushed down.  He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
331423176
and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
-1023679443
threshold.  He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water
1418710371
out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.  I did
1490694422
not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.  The lamp was lit.  The
-1654144008
clock was on the stroke of twelve.
-301538974

-1923438341
"Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go, good-
1745742816
night--good-night, my darling!"
305752974

-1923438341
He kissed me repeatedly.  When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
144357086
stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.  I only smiled at her, and ran
-2061345674
upstairs.  "Explanation will do for another time," thought I.  Still,
-878798174
when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
-1242275892
temporarily misconstrue what she had seen.  But joy soon effaced every
-1871432244
other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
-1077896616
crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
1741007601
the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
1808545023
fear and little awe.  Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
-373790545
of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that was
2071691266
strength for anything.
-2042895219

-1923438341
Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell
835571685
me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been
-1743428522
struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
2026536629

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXIV
1906434183

-1923438341

-1923438341
As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if
-2133688712
it were a dream.  I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen
-285435869
Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.
1815536765

-1923438341
While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
-1607887383
was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour;
1615004553
and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and
1382238971
borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.  I had often been unwilling to
-623323262
look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look;
197724825
but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
1220839014
affection by its expression.  I took a plain but clean and light summer
-605402233
dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well
-1379517488
become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
1207900832

-1923438341
I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
-2009065966
brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to
195849874
feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant
1585791644
breeze.  Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.  A beggar-woman and
-1816102073
her little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I
1293494693
ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some
649550700
three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
1495161063
The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so
1754762336
musical as my own rejoicing heart.
1755565331

-1923438341
Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
1027035654
countenance, and saying gravely--"Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?"
-150764047
During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her
-522626203
then.  I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she.  I
-1263642654
ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs.  I met Adele leaving the
575031635
schoolroom.
-461106028

-1923438341
"Where are you going?  It is time for lessons."
1600019565

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
110311455

-1923438341
"Where is he?"
1996840884

-1923438341
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
1528911894
there he stood.
-1267681450

-1923438341
"Come and bid me good-morning," said he.  I gladly advanced; and it was
944242868
not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received,
-829403431
but an embrace and a kiss.  It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so
357119209
well loved, so caressed by him.
-256756729

-1923438341
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
757138186
pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard-
109559402
seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips;
1242934784
the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?"  (I had green
-1448304450
eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they were
288156767
new-dyed, I suppose.)
1073371872

-1923438341
"It is Jane Eyre, sir."
1994397240

-1923438341
"Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
-1831795135
more.  Do you hear that?"
1350976692

-1923438341
I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.  The
-986130661
feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
-1941985336
was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned.  It was, I
1629417804
think almost fear.
-515152703

-1923438341
"You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
1327373323

-1923438341
"Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so
1069465303
strange."
247757985

-1923438341
"Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax
-1461969021
Rochester's girl-bride."
1720927882

-1923438341
"It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never
-269085833
enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different
-231493520
destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is
469964555
a fairy tale--a day-dream."
1276660219

-1923438341
"Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I
614542552
wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
-2022627156
keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope
334207279
to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be
-76871135
yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
-2117204458

-1923438341
"Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of.
1069154949
Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
-1792696536
have them."
647749464

-1923438341
"I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on
598067815
your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped
-1505170816
her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets
-946055729
on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings."
-1251539536

-1923438341
"No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in
-828897365
another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain,
2144331413
Quakerish governess."
-1206494677

-1923438341
"You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
-548222064
heart,--delicate and aerial."
546956295

-1923438341
"Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are
-479743680
sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!"
-593781782

-1923438341
"I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on, while
-1463283157
I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I felt he
1129373510
was either deluding himself or trying to delude me.  "I will attire my
1923944508
Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will
1280208830
cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
-953987763

-1923438341
"And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
1183480688
longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I
1155837801
would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as
1626065638
myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir,
-1893210241
though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't
-1131958780
flatter me."
1505688163

-1923438341
He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.  "This
2114272246
very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
-1577537670
choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four
-14255408
weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below
1778619952
yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief
-107266032
stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French
-1561897863
vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old
-716460344
story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities;
1802096611
and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others."
592006331

-1923438341
"Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?"
1853702555

-1923438341
"You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
1523936622
Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
253245845
wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years
-802201850
since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my
1274579331
companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel
-1899910307
as my comforter."
-1337219874

-1923438341
I laughed at him as he said this.  "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
-474928881
I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must
-1574834470
neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get
1726319183
it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
-534483750
anticipate."
-889784950

-1923438341
"What do you anticipate of me?"
812044180

-1923438341
"For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little
-1642886858
while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and
362191734
then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when
1703282302
you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I
1862732063
say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months,
-1052071913
or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned
-1776758179
as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as
-237920598
a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my
-1265562110
dear master."
-920052346

-1923438341
"Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and
-216125262
yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
1807627409
you--with truth, fervour, constancy."
-1079348549

-1923438341
"Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
459297504

-1923438341
"To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
1701229777
find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a
1712699058
perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness,
366501210
and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul
2038309729
made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once
-1728217627
supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true."
-203335124

-1923438341
"Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love
447810813
such an one?"
2129815228

-1923438341
"I love it now."
-9347243

-1923438341
"But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
758763348
standard?"
879536599

-1923438341
"I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you
-167357391
seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
-813502717
am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
1752596699
my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is
1517928032
sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
-216243330
beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that
-1935712353
inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
-1932476437

-1923438341
"I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
28377201
was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--"
1700661318

-1923438341
"You were, you little elfish--"
-831757588

-1923438341
"Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
-544302355
gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would
-1382410207
no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as
1926611932
suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year
-1542428834
hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
1875603527
pleasure to grant."
-1157449731

-1923438341
"Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--"
1019733916

-1923438341
"Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
-1662289266

-1923438341
"Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
-1659028237
swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me."
-1266965316

-1923438341
"Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
-1986575559
crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
86399833
that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
-2066599474

-1923438341
"I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted
1451778236
then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker.
704736088
But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be
1508880536
withdrawn: try again."
-1419098999

-1923438341
"Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much
376417923
piqued on one point."
678861144

-1923438341
He looked disturbed.  "What? what?" he said hastily.  "Curiosity is a
1289226706
dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
1664186632
request--"
-616956047

-1923438341
"But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
564064020

-1923438341
"Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps,
-1645369450
a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
-71918063

-1923438341
"Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you
-2100176635
think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much
377366279
rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your
1014587790
confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
1121192977

-1923438341
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for
1755189665
God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't
-353474361
turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
1675623929

-1923438341
"Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
-1506082099
conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I
929315453
had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
531528244
entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay
2006289516
of my power?"
-996432479

-1923438341
"I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is
-362350259
up."
-1950753568

-1923438341
"Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows
1742985497
have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
-896647927
some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
-1722866402
thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
984628559

-1923438341
"If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
449240324
up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what
481597122
had you to ask, thing,--out with it?"
119596270

-1923438341
"There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
-1016404027
better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is
2145166760
what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
-1313240451
wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
1844205419

-1923438341
"Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!"  And now he unknit his black
1328720393
brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
1948529661
pleased at seeing a danger averted.  "I think I may confess," he
-1575330585
continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and
459391986
I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You
-1681152283
glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate,
-535365150
and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who
304456284
made me the offer."
534721914

-1923438341
"Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?"
-525294513

-1923438341
"Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you
2100740658
as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be
-1501405941
the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end."
1698771859

-1923438341
"Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my
-765735780
little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
-2036610555
in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
-129459259

-1923438341
"Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling.
1549429855
Were you jealous, Jane?"
1892405938

-1923438341
"Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
-1358969981
that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not
1786094218
suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and
876465258
deserted?"
1787419765

-1923438341
"Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
945184095
idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
1036273432
moment."
616289569

-1923438341
"You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your
-123660013
principles on some points are eccentric."
-203002247

-1923438341
"My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
-279039510
awry for want of attention."
636890525

-1923438341
"Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
1076172545
vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
1871607130
bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
-1625180786

-1923438341
"That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
-893735777
world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant
-2051937240
unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
2009495063

-1923438341
I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder.  I loved him very
-1728932361
much--more than I could trust myself to say--more than words had power to
-1840220855
express.
553887663

-1923438341
"Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
1370363165
entreated, and to yield."
-1510282017

-1923438341
I was again ready with my request.  "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
-140108382
Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
827617672
shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me
1427711768
to be misjudged by so good a woman."
557911673

-1923438341
"Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied.  "I mean you to
1207841519
accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
-2013846759
drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think,
716283106
Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
-1625170182

-1923438341
"I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
1260489465

-1923438341
"Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
-1058035925
those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go."
-681666688

-1923438341
I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
-149046980
parlour, I hurried down to it.  The old lady, had been reading her
-41523599
morning portion of Scripture--the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
488524763
before her, and her spectacles were upon it.  Her occupation, suspended
-309110922
by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed on
1453282237
the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind stirred
853716612
by unwonted tidings.  Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a sort of
260240724
effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile
1615091794
expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.  She put up her
2033465538
spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
1396591024

-1923438341
"I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
-291179286
Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half
-495746014
fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
-853116005
happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze,
-1781364362
that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat
1377495435
down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice,
-463576381
as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that
-1075179871
Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I
494349825
really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month
2091303321
you would be his wife."
744286481

-1923438341
"He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
1124481855

-1923438341
"He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?"
-235557045

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
She looked at me bewildered.  "I could never have thought it.  He is a
-688079075
proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked
-685000614
money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?"
-756517014

-1923438341
"He tells me so."
-943179038

-1923438341
She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
602557835
found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
-1759858694

-1923438341
"It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt, it is true since you say
1944241719
so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of
1333914272
position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
-1246709589
twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your
1578388895
father."
1323166732

-1923438341
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my
-2018651923
father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant.
-996967347
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and-
-1961871523
twenty."
443133759

-1923438341
"Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
1972221050

-1923438341
I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
-1607157999
eyes.
-1954282109

-1923438341
"I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young, and
-391640757
so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is
-665452654
an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do
-492978772
fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or
-386834246
I expect."
-543105682

-1923438341
"Why?--am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
-922019312
should have a sincere affection for me?"
737830026

-1923438341
"No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
-1246378436
daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of
-228547200
pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
-540826662
uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
1035048305
guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I
-1988851037
knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
-1311629813
discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
-1274010332
trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I
-224668755
suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
-137475495
nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with
-1230518769
him."
-1495546105

-1923438341
"Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
-1722604149
that all was right."
-2031700567

-1923438341
"I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
-1273623822
cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
2075332061
distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not
-942495443
accustomed to marry their governesses."
-704148977

-1923438341
I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adele ran in.
-168965935

-1923438341
"Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!" she cried.  "Mr. Rochester
1447596211
won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let
-1091329836
me go mademoiselle."
-1788145010

-1923438341
"That I will, Adele;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
855405573
gloomy monitress.  The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round to
10500206
the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following him
647104958
backwards and forwards.
417105415

-1923438341
"Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
398061133

-1923438341
"I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you."
-898576893

-1923438341
"Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
1059665758

-1923438341
"Not it: she will be a restraint."
-1866683261

-1923438341
He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice.  The chill of Mrs.
-2031052980
Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something of
2104492109
unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes.  I half lost the
730734560
sense of power over him.  I was about mechanically to obey him, without
-2029494790
further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked at
-754016409
my face.
1152262362

-1923438341
"What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really
-1363665968
wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
-1578256403

-1923438341
"I would far rather she went, sir."
1697487128

-1923438341
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he
-358489789
to Adele.
1175536911

-1923438341
She obeyed him with what speed she might.
-1934880670

-1923438341
"After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
-13227205
he, "when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and
-202412003
company--for life."
-173250910

-1923438341
Adele, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
316309995
gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
-1156766002
corner on the other side of him.  She then peeped round to where I sat;
221828205
so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him, in his present fractious
1323222987
mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any information.
-1230139730

-1923438341
"Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir:
623771687
there is plenty of room on this side."
-1655744729

-1923438341
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog.  "I'll send her to school
-1148121178
yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
-1889832133

-1923438341
Adele heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
155766955
mademoiselle?"
1582743201

-1923438341
"Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
1595594168
mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
-1923416465
white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me
614102611
there, and only me."
-540274972

-1923438341
"She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adele.
-1429372379

-1923438341
"I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides
1363926040
in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele."
1792671057

-1923438341
"She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
-15419424

-1923438341
"Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her
-509650018
up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
1158721653

-1923438341
"Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will
1229498460
wear out: how can she get new ones?"
980579525

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled.  "Hem!" said he.  "What would you
281075278
do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a
435957477
pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty
-1913395655
enough scarf out of a rainbow."
-1224831367

-1923438341
"She is far better as she is," concluded Adele, after musing some time:
545341950
"besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I
733657764
were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
-1866258528

-1923438341
"She has consented: she has pledged her word."
-896046886

-1923438341
"But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
1191567397
air; and neither you nor she can fly."
-504770383

-1923438341
"Adele, look at that field."  We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
1631371168
bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
-824443866
well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber
66597651
trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
629565656

-1923438341
"In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
-875991034
since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
-1302397113
meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on
-379577571
a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to
565716247
write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for
1895389124
happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was
853730197
fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two
-214523390
yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of
-1791057017
gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my
-642937521
knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
-2116128181
read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this
-278767732
effect--
-1390565651

-1923438341
"It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
445206364
make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
-1924183913
place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her
-1058707630
horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
64410838
vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
810804402
as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
-234571207

-1923438341
"'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman
-1581338652
will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put
-732436403
it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and
-1383173784
you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
-984252888
She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket,
633494599
under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring
1454201314
again."
661393109

-1923438341
"But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy:
750230939
you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
421409302

-1923438341
"Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously.  Whereupon I
1742505894
told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund
1497683517
of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
438492368
menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
-58395861
"contes de fee," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand
144299484
meme il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
-564107281
ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
-1795754495

-1923438341
The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me.  Mr.
1388792065
Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
-881362127
ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.  I hated the business, I begged
1179997844
leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now.  By dint of
-548262425
entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
1418129858
two: these however, he vowed he would select himself.  With anxiety I
161849886
watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of the
1985250067
most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.  I told him in a
-145666951
new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a
1200778426
silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
-2036964633
choice.  With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
54139348
persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
-1031075831
pearl-grey silk.  "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he would
-1536061710
yet see me glittering like a parterre."
-1549576000

-1923438341
Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
1011196892
jewellers shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
-475772855
sense of annoyance and degradation.  As we re-entered the carriage, and I
347045450
sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events,
887721503
dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John
-1600331500
Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his legatee.
-1528780640
"It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so small an
-8319294
independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr.
1654577717
Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling
-2030256966
daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell
-1052296831
my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a
1542831214
prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I
1561968003
could better endure to be kept by him now."  And somewhat relieved by
1565374309
this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I ventured once more
2020510564
to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought
391451058
mine, though I averted both face and gaze.  He smiled; and I thought his
-517844657
smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow
-2066040382
on a slave his gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his hand, which was
1415854993
ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the
-1873426732
passionate pressure.
2077572583

-1923438341
"You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
-1736909043
but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in
1042716504
this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the
-698851073
pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black
667721725
satin."
699783440

-1923438341
He chuckled; he rubbed his hands.  "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?"
895341821
he exclaimed.  "Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange
-876859787
this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle-
-1902934779
eyes, houri forms, and all!"
279781853

-1923438341
The Eastern allusion bit me again.  "I'll not stand you an inch in the
376121300
stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
-1566094212
one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
2068561014
to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave-
544329392
purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
-1343134446
satisfactorily here."
-482896928

-1923438341
"And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
-51705424
flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
-1397631040

-1923438341
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to
827721543
them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get
-1693585743
admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as
504243655
you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands:
-1994944881
nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a
-1767853329
charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
-1914111296

-1923438341
"I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
-564566426

-1923438341
"I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an
1897680841
eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever
-2146148624
charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released,
-1167249873
would be to violate its conditions."
1154216392

-1923438341
"Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through
2047507017
a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You
1625222001
will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?"
-245312075

-1923438341
"I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do
2067205135
you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the
-222108047
cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I
1053449535
shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board
40417686
and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own
-1139307547
wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--"
-1516986112

-1923438341
"Well, but what?"
504750890

-1923438341
"Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit."
-113547033

-1923438341
"Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your
-758834286
equal," said he.  We were now approaching Thornfield.  "Will it please
976068444
you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the gates.
-305421186

-1923438341
"No, thank you, sir."
-952675260

-1923438341
"And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
2042483990

-1923438341
"I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now:
-1791550644
till--"
745545388

-1923438341
"Till what?  You delight in half-phrases."
-875516688

-1923438341
"Till I can't help it."
-350972282

-1923438341
"Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
-990715346
companion of my repast?"
1029365926

-1923438341
"I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as
435866185
usual for another month."
1664240072

-1923438341
"You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
-74785152

-1923438341
"Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with
-798405205
it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
620025320
accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
-680834562
disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
-1233007923

-1923438341
"I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this,
-508187838
'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I
-401622610
have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It
373149110
is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when
1883718752
once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll
1664915154
just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this" (touching
2065296296
his watch-guard).  "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest
912205152
my jewel I should tyne."
-329670839

-1923438341
He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
-1463045788
afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my
661341505
retreat upstairs.
1753926797

-1923438341
He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening.  I had prepared an
9368042
occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a
1119394071
_tete-a-tete_ conversation.  I remembered his fine voice; I knew he liked
944150604
to sing--good singers generally do.  I was no vocalist myself, and, in
1929436346
his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
1935977856
listening when the performance was good.  No sooner had twilight, that
1919827149
hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
-193052705
lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
1801244490
of heaven, to give me a song.  He said I was a capricious witch, and that
-828009422
he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like
-845167794
the present.
-2144618925

-1923438341
"Did I like his voice?" he asked.
362306043

-1923438341
"Very much."  I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his;
-1760231861
but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe and
-2083781401
stimulate it.
-1114575569

-1923438341
"Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
-1843265772

-1923438341
"Very well, sir, I will try."
69357576

-1923438341
I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
1686453135
little bungler."  Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was
-1249879236
precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
1427399188
himself: for he could play as well as sing.  I hied me to the
1193507121
window-recess.  And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
-358766549
and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
1675087800
strain:--
-1233071182

-1923438341
   "The truest love that ever heart
-310120065
      Felt at its kindled core,
-2132846472
   Did through each vein, in quickened start,
983151204
      The tide of being pour.
-304118805

-1923438341
   Her coming was my hope each day,
1426384125
      Her parting was my pain;
-585653111
   The chance that did her steps delay
-1160465632
      Was ice in every vein.
-994512300

-1923438341
   I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
-1899234145
      As I loved, loved to be;
1133424084
   And to this object did I press
-1765226084
      As blind as eagerly.
-400832439

-1923438341
   But wide as pathless was the space
382986509
      That lay our lives between,
-21750719
   And dangerous as the foamy race
-1045676150
      Of ocean-surges green.
-1587518685

-1923438341
   And haunted as a robber-path
-1104052038
      Through wilderness or wood;
89339598
   For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
-1212760321
      Between our spirits stood.
-2089581112

-1923438341
   I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
1461473531
      I omens did defy:
-1822104949
   Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
-2092185846
      I passed impetuous by.
1712751198

-1923438341
   On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
-184705968
      I flew as in a dream;
1034996861
   For glorious rose upon my sight
2094988810
      That child of Shower and Gleam.
-1249712176

-1923438341
   Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
152267085
      Shines that soft, solemn joy;
474272354
   Nor care I now, how dense and grim
-1029239531
      Disasters gather nigh.
314040661

-1923438341
   I care not in this moment sweet,
-1949888514
      Though all I have rushed o'er
1756453172
   Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
-453777096
      Proclaiming vengeance sore:
1802005921

-1923438341
   Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
-1707593022
      Right, bar approach to me,
-786473425
   And grinding Might, with furious frown,
-692556409
      Swear endless enmity.
-108643269

-1923438341
   My love has placed her little hand
1287491198
      With noble faith in mine,
865479054
   And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
1782303462
      Our nature shall entwine.
-31624958

-1923438341
   My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
605128923
      With me to live--to die;
2003533506
   I have at last my nameless bliss.
-44638561
      As I love--loved am I!"
2022797298

-1923438341
He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his full
265505999
falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.  I
-1551398467
quailed momentarily--then I rallied.  Soft scene, daring demonstration, I
-722479970
would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon of defence must be
-126782544
prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I asked with asperity,
890359254
"whom he was going to marry now?"
-378070435

-1923438341
"That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
1456390648

-1923438341
"Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked
-1792741863
of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan
859522758
idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that."
938290701

-1923438341
"Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
-1054730525
Death was not for such as I."
-1034462191

-1923438341
"Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had:
668186470
but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
1093772457

-1923438341
"Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
-206371239
reconciling kiss?"
-647629241

-1923438341
"No: I would rather be excused."
-1883236505

-1923438341
Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
-474188021
added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such
298502595
stanzas crooned in her praise."
1825397070

-1923438341
I assured him I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he would often
-1699073318
find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
292746404
rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
-1161927554
should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was yet
-869898368
time to rescind it.
-1118097715

-1923438341
"Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
1256409961

-1923438341
"I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered
-1241841201
myself I was doing that now."
-1345664416

-1923438341
He fretted, pished, and pshawed.  "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
747588333
and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I
-751967113
am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
1595071326
bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from
-164023636
the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that
-1125549433
distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual
-314122482
advantage."
-1071288288

-1923438341
From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
1735203140
after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
46750644
got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
180666541
wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
-145467801

-1923438341
The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
-2038786359
probation; and with the best success.  He was kept, to be sure, rather
-1253672786
cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
1642220367
entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility,
-1074735364
while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his judgment,
-384144774
satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
1409258657

-1923438341
In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any
-1342990496
other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening
298915587
conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him.  He continued to send for
-2114706982
me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared
1924932061
before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and "darling" on
-1415818732
his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking puppet,"
1106445083
"malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c.  For caresses, too, I now
501848428
got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss
208037451
on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.  It was all right: at present I
-1108421161
decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender.  Mrs.
-1445149763
Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on my account vanished;
1112234487
therefore I was certain I did well.  Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I
-2102706275
was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my
1891056628
present conduct at some period fast coming.  I laughed in my sleeve at
415592271
his menaces.  "I can keep you in reasonable check now," I reflected; "and
1204809068
I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its
-711691879
virtue, another must be devised."
-1268406226

-1923438341
Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
714304782
pleased than teased him.  My future husband was becoming to me my whole
1011343082
world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven.  He stood
-1490213301
between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
1156104183
between man and the broad sun.  I could not, in those days, see God for
-424737641
His creature: of whom I had made an idol.

CHAPTER XXV
1092646685

-1923438341

-1923438341
The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
516847279
numbered.  There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal
70520982
day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.  _I_, at least,
1347138121
had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
596916597
ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
-17351666
time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
230186324
(D.V.),--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I
-1007012537
knew not.  The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four
1418848858
little squares, in the drawer.  Mr. Rochester had himself written the
2134346568
direction, "Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London," on each: I could not
1845239052
persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.  Mrs. Rochester!
-631425020
She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after
1956317874
eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she had come into the
1966446141
world alive before I assigned to her all that property.  It was enough
118226216
that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be
-1711577109
hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:
-1372055887
for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
1211206031
pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
-307170483
portmanteau.  I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
1681723983
apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out
-2140677236
certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.  "I
-1474621919
will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said.  "I am feverish: I hear
634574070
the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
-1371735489

-1923438341
It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only
1306989138
the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence
-21775372
to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in
247447590
producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late
-1334841836
hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind
1981705850
more than they.
-670161474

-1923438341
I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.  Something had happened
217725544
which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
-498798836
myself: it had taken place the preceding night.  Mr. Rochester that night
-46247828
was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had called him to
-48359428
a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty miles
2006148456
off--business it was requisite he should settle in person, previous to
-1948273174
his meditated departure from England.  I waited now his return; eager to
2004679814
disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of the enigma that
-1657080979
perplexed me.  Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret
-565785375
to him, you shall share the confidence.
234067276

-1923438341
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
-824640628
had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
2088668123
speck of rain.  Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
1723340196
augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way,
-1648939864
never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an
-1450439316
hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
1279688106
northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
1048789968
mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
-449133487

-1923438341
It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
-1421008820
delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
-1560024529
through space.  Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
-183469153
chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
741000045
centre, gasped ghastly.  The cloven halves were not broken from each
-628433964
other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
1239788126
though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more:
1480764093
their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
336170810
would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
-245220623
be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
-1340302488

-1923438341
"You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the monster-
1200932099
splinters were living things, and could hear me.  "I think, scathed as
-1874672964
you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life
1641683693
in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots:
982884132
you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests
776442904
and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over
-1316044584
with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to
1830708310
sympathise with him in his decay."  As I looked up at them, the moon
890593126
appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure;
-144680723
her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she seemed to throw on me one
1974163031
bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep
764653661
drift of cloud.  The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far
1840730092
away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to
91689654
listen to, and I ran off again.
-1349966819

-1923438341
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with
-1155590292
which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed
1201625731
myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the
-1202832792
house and put them away in the store-room.  Then I repaired to the
-226394346
library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer, I knew
2053889902
on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful
-1343014526
hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and
2133381994
burnt well.  I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the
-579195348
table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in
-1033541182
ready for lighting.  More restless than ever, when I had completed these
83969469
arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a
-843342232
little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall
1021441386
simultaneously struck ten.
-58556154

-1923438341
"How late it grows!" I said.  "I will run down to the gates: it is
1409867948
moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be
-1200060292
coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
624904251

-1923438341
The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
2110330640
the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
-32388920
still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
944920528
intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
-875445416
by one moving speck.
1181330752

-1923438341
A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and
-1960935542
impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.  I lingered; the moon shut
-623892258
herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense
256209158
cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
501976320

-1923438341
"I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
322829955
hypochondriac foreboding.  I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
785084053
was dark: what could keep him?  Had an accident happened?  The event of
2126610370
last night again recurred to me.  I interpreted it as a warning of
-824464192
disaster.  I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
-1979004558
enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
1896031284
meridian, and must now decline.
-881131196

-1923438341
"Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
1070592382
fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
-328974595
than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
-799346020

-1923438341
I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a
-1575638718
mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog
-1535918627
ran by his side.  Away with evil presentiment!  It was he: here he was,
805596148
mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot.  He saw me; for the moon had
-1887601321
opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his
-541790139
hat off, and waved it round his head.  I now ran to meet him.
2129829694

-1923438341
"There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
1722609939
saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe;
1235662210
give me both hands: mount!"
-1303459877

-1923438341
I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him.  A hearty kissing I
365462811
got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
1485328023
as I could.  He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
-1615371322
there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
892409735
hour?  Is there anything wrong?"
-1969490298

-1923438341
"No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the
273114883
house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
-1606753359

-1923438341
"Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
167625525
cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and
1487876545
hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
-207114135

-1923438341
"Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
-1156833726

-1923438341
"Then you have been both?"
-592802232

-1923438341
"Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay
-1301911758
you will only laugh at me for my pains."
-1963027327

-1923438341
"I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not:
1035404488
my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an
1109984545
eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a
-1403724075
finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a
-1481438820
stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your
-1772710621
shepherd, did you, Jane?"
162142204

-1923438341
"I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
-1787377746
get down."
754054007

-1923438341
He landed me on the pavement.  As John took his horse, and he followed me
1712793231
into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and
754107769
then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the
1257348581
staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long;
586054570
in five minutes I rejoined him.  I found him at supper.
1751050784

-1923438341
"Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
1568881859
but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
664577083

-1923438341
I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.  "Is it because you
-1001074051
have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of
-860370760
going to London that takes away your appetite?"
-299759363

-1923438341
"I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what
-1613196193
thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal."
-756952557

-1923438341
"Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me."
-917669899

-1923438341
"You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
-66372577

-1923438341
He held out his hand, laughing.  "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
294957009
close to my eyes.  He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well
1237230352
as a long, strong arm.
258249055

-1923438341
"Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
-583623970
before my face.  "Sir, have you finished supper?"
1567434843

-1923438341
"Yes, Jane."
2121243822

-1923438341
I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.  When we were again alone, I
255722329
stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
874864528

-1923438341
"It is near midnight," I said.
1706326018

-1923438341
"Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
-1007391891
my wedding."
-1009642885

-1923438341
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
-210466597
no wish to go to bed."
-371673501

-1923438341
"Are all your arrangements complete?"
1030110390

-1923438341
"All, sir."
1328999066

-1923438341
"And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
-94993987
we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return
1795544812
from church."
105934388

-1923438341
"Very well, sir."
-2006003914

-1923438341
"With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,'
-1399704446
Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
1138523526
strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?"
-109875128

-1923438341
"I believe I am."
-417006666

-1923438341
"Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel."
1616716397

-1923438341
"I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this
876945093
present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come
-941316542
charged?"
-450963735

-1923438341
"This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or
-1880412730
over-fatigued."
-2025310021

-1923438341
"Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
-625935144

-1923438341
"Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core."
-2088567452

-1923438341
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent
1852963223
and flushed.
-1369150148

-1923438341
"Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
674243810
weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that
-137650856
I shall not prove a good husband?"
-990029521

-1923438341
"It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
-262722390

-1923438341
"Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the
1298837049
new life into which you are passing?"
62884514

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
-329616807
and pain me.  I want an explanation."
1227616288

-1923438341
"Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?"
-269864745

-1923438341
"I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
-652429885
happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
-980727407
short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said
-1363432010
something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your
114024325
sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
352622285

-1923438341
"No, sir."  It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded
1983913839
its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I
-1500843355
proceeded.
803888103

-1923438341
"All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
-190858433
bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
422235245
fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
-679575923
have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't
-1651545234
caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in
969856903
Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good
812864759
and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air
830285727
and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your
1219064958
journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of
-128466969
you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your
2131946202
actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life,
1661275080
sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more
-2096748210
so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows
908077874
of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a
-1528256807
dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the
87156590
air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs
-312093849
to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in
-1296796350
the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely
1214966391
extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I
337574023
would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I
545374928
smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your
1390040188
aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in
-1017225367
the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the
-1557635497
square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my
-1180555175
low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could
139370144
bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw
-2041726389
plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers,
137931964
and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your
1810570803
wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a
1070231987
coronet."
-1366167909

-1923438341
"How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
-1504902347
did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or
-806520019
a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
-1945302569

-1923438341
"No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
-787419894
nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
830665234
because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark,
1617668610
the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and
-1147249741
high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you
-295211193
were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
-936737948
and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I
1883974513
could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale
-2051845068
still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether
746682664
in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred,
279877703
doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some
2048081005
dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I
1609817227
continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also
1624453744
the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful
1047738509
consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I
2094901524
was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed
-643749843
me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a
1633061971
very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in
-1945771352
my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you
-1798503681
were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to
-414880886
overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat
1666882958
you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away
423814506
inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every
1264680086
moment."
616289569

-1923438341
"And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
-1258010564
you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of
1015093116
real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that;
668941124
and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
-1020539656
lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
2100691300
sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
-516057547
living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me,
189320965
Jane?--repeat it."
932795045

-1923438341
"I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart."
1760925432

-1923438341
"Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
931633571
sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you
-1254990439
said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
-101535104
gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
691419061
too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know
1562199988
well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
43476370
you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be
1066961131
incensed than saddened."
-629738379

-1923438341
"I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
1026103062
finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
1702473555

-1923438341
"I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source
-2146866827
of your melancholy in a dream."
1941476377

-1923438341
I shook my head.  "What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be
1757297066
anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on."
-1423257303

-1923438341
The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
1991948396
manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
-536318483

-1923438341
"I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the
1591442888
retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front
2141205694
nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
-2016331993
fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-
-812062149
grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there
-830178347
over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
-1541864886
carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
-774576918
however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress,
-636942335
I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
1054062709
road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
-392641456
for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
1748994466
haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled
-1007627398
from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung
1980661515
round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the
813475177
summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.
-393317585
The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow
-1018449732
ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the
1554291618
road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was
-1071875020
shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and
-2122127731
woke."
826317831

-1923438341
"Now, Jane, that is all."
1741425254

-1923438341
"All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam
1330823036
dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it
1445769202
was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a
-660396153
light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
-683547444
going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a
-39775496
rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered;
-1460658483
but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and
1338630810
surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I
1631806809
again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent
748765824
forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my
-1079141408
blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie,
826171753
it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of
1082522421
it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole."
659853675

-1923438341
"It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
-1080781482

-1923438341
"No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing
1738343016
before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
-2053135247
Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
-851631881

-1923438341
"Describe it, Jane."
1375944112

-1923438341
"It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
1784561850
hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was
642374772
white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
-1985832570

-1923438341
"Did you see her face?"
228652699

-1923438341
"Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
902975301
it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
-836657567
turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
-987874966
and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
833863059

-1923438341
"And how were they?"
-480043412

-1923438341
"Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was
-99304237
a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll
-2086811013
of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
-1158095012

-1923438341
"Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
1735473431

-1923438341
"This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
839185687
furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall
1147756632
I tell you of what it reminded me?"
1867187661

-1923438341
"You may."
1851035343

-1923438341
"Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre."
833102196

-1923438341
"Ah!--what did it do?"
-797119682

-1923438341
"Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
1039278233
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
1480100141

-1923438341
{It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
216249217
flinging both on the floor, trampled on them: p272.jpg}
285122606

-1923438341
"Afterwards?"
-870956620

-1923438341
"It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
-346631295
approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at
1143238445
my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust
-1382316800
up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was
75232580
aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for
-1571109734
the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible
567131693
from terror."
-685162795

-1923438341
"Who was with you when you revived?"
-439785659

-1923438341
"No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in
1252687863
water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
-157206743
and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now,
285715126
sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
882936460

-1923438341
"The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be
894545313
careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
308655818
handling."
-1971835905

-1923438341
"Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the
1140579436
transaction actually took place."
517200709

-1923438341
"And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a
-637580274
ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you
-1892945365
without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?"
2032621882

-1923438341
"Not yet."
849740274

-1923438341
"Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind
-341445926
us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
-112760200
recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
-818826963

-1923438341
"Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
-1918082405
wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
-384906703
mystery of that awful visitant."
1594210594

-1923438341
"And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
562602484

-1923438341
"But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
-361080128
looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
955473438
aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I
-1615600717
saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top
-1018068826
to bottom in two halves!"
1212560410

-1923438341
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
2123253667
me.  "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come near
763575899
you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what
1136473852
might have happened!"
2075686494

-1923438341
He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
292754418
scarcely pant.  After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily--
-16127161

-1923438341
"Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half
1975351409
reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
-385632108
was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself:
-284670063
from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me?
575151231
what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her
-301177937
entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you
253874273
ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long
1125549471
dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were
873080509
figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of
1578351678
the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep
1326026469
such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I
-1802371989
will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my
1077111174
solution of the mystery?"
436073455

-1923438341
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
2054296110
satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
-269438902
so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
-1098346259
smile.  And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
1734739419

-1923438341
"Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit my
-1561746015
candle.
1292145377

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share
-211996891
it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
312603523
related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
769829635
alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
28827466

-1923438341
"I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
-1116858850

-1923438341
"And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go
-537860377
upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to-
2031173387
morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
-887337370
And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you
-253181267
hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more
2013724596
beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted up the
1476136104
curtain)--"it is a lovely night!"
-2044224765

-1923438341
It was.  Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
1336400856
before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward
-867010222
in long, silvered columns.  The moon shone peacefully.
-837018836

-1923438341
"Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
-1821512465
Janet now?"
-403111017

-1923438341
"The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
-668501296

-1923438341
"And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
-8988187
love and blissful union."
-399527721

-1923438341
This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow,
-1041019810
but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.  With little
-1485500539
Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so
1294017685
passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day: all my life was
-1920040943
awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.  I
454365848
remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I
-317380156
loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange
825390078
emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still
564905708
sound repose.  She seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now
-1889021468
to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future
-145318720
day.

CHAPTER XXVI
-1240415003

-1923438341

-1923438341
Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
150450374
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
1723601187
impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.  She was just
-445112724
fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with a
855735326
brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
266910525

-1923438341
"Stop!" she cried in French.  "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
-941183695
not taken one peep."
1657310338

-1923438341
So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
595914517
usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.  "Jane!" called
-731996411
a voice, and I hastened down.  I was received at the foot of the stairs
-2036323232
by Mr. Rochester.
-387670998

-1923438341
"Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry
221989048
so long!"
-552977522

-1923438341
He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced
1210446129
me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of
841638810
his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten minutes to eat
-1208699876
some breakfast, he rang the bell.  One of his lately hired servants, a
1175295349
footman, answered it.
-521423497

-1923438341
"Is John getting the carriage ready?"
1856369099

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Is the luggage brought down?"
1644241897

-1923438341
"They are bringing it down, sir."
1192591945

-1923438341
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are
-103981282
there: return and tell me."
-828530729

-1923438341
The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
-715878403
footman soon returned.
1183571356

-1923438341
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
-1035919875

-1923438341
"And the carriage?"
1165412360

-1923438341
"The horses are harnessing."
-761505857

-1923438341
"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we
-742429436
return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
-1335202222
coachman in his seat."
-411557672

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Jane, are you ready?"
1530345896

-1923438341
I rose.  There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
-1613055969
for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.  Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
851386123
hall as we passed.   I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
2131541390
held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
1130476148
follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second
-413867769
of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.  I wonder what other
-1379625749
bridegroom ever looked as he did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
-27490596
resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming
2119962043
and flashing eyes.
2100031031

-1923438341
I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
618262273
gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
-988468033
seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.  I wanted to see the
-2023309732
invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
-460880223
glance fierce and fell.  I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
1768343487
seemed breasting and resisting.
1710460236

-1923438341
At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
-1227458611
breath.  "Am I cruel in my love?" he said.  "Delay an instant: lean on
-353705985
me, Jane."
1868015683

-1923438341
And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm
1310723688
before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky
68627613
beyond.  I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have
-1141258385
not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low
833433344
hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.  I
-1932233589
noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of
-972797463
the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle
-455313768
door and witness the ceremony.  By Mr. Rochester they were not observed;
-1329403217
he was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay,
1183022259
momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips
-1431496822
cold.  When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the
-312119836
path to the porch.
51965293

-1923438341
We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
923141798
surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him.  All was still: two
2034003017
shadows only moved in a remote corner.  My conjecture had been correct:
1399136594
the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
-138339233
of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the
-1844616738
old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains
-775224029
of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil
628791470
wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
1577182593

-1923438341
Our place was taken at the communion rails.  Hearing a cautious step
-1477083008
behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman,
-939292219
evidently--was advancing up the chancel.  The service began.  The
1121300028
explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the
1667383789
clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr.
797458912
Rochester, went on.
-1457854410

-1923438341
"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of
-216371257
judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if
278528289
either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
-1629983747
together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that
1749176497
so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are
-707782257
not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful."
-1934942981

-1923438341
He paused, as the custom is.  When is the pause after that sentence ever
1846344568
broken by reply?  Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.  And the
1784662194
clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
652618282
breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
1198442078
towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this
-349547875
woman for thy wedded wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said--
-1839537852

-1923438341
"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
1038114785

-1923438341
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the
1600883964
same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under
625297199
his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he
1948124064
said, "Proceed."
988478257

-1923438341
Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
-933933285
intonation.  Presently Mr. Wood said--
-37508771

-1923438341
"I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted,
-655363199
and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
1027440105

-1923438341
"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us.  "I am
-92994051
in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this
-1928971249
marriage exists."
1564103407

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid, making
577324518
no movement but to possess himself of my hand.  What a hot and strong
2062423345
grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm, massive
-26233984
front at this moment!  How his eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild
-2027916398
beneath!
1600068322

-1923438341
Mr. Wood seemed at a loss.  "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
267073975
asked.  "Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?"
-512923610

-1923438341
"Hardly," was the answer.  "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
1222909468
advisedly."
1500485572

-1923438341
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.  He continued, uttering
772980776
each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly--
-1856236884

-1923438341
"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr.
-58143841
Rochester has a wife now living."
912988936

-1923438341
My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
-207535466
to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
-66128553
frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.  I
-327307023
looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me.  His whole face was
15416112
colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint.  He disavowed nothing:
96741395
he seemed as if he would defy all things.  Without speaking, without
-1026164867
smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined
1444512358
my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
-2040969397

-1923438341
"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
-1449262862

-1923438341
"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London."
742689502

-1923438341
"And you would thrust on me a wife?"
1448061486

-1923438341
"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
-1956316481
recognises, if you do not."
-1134894486

-1923438341
"Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her
1500371078
place of abode."
-574974801

-1923438341
"Certainly."  Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
-817033344
out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--
-1539492605

-1923438341
"'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of
696296333
fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the
-661482784
county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married
-1885347627
to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant,
1753785157
and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town,
985442554
Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of
-870697730
that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard
1625397189
Mason.'"
-126300610

-1923438341
"That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does
-244737803
not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
1216727773

-1923438341
"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
677863236

-1923438341
"How do you know?"
511132322

-1923438341
"I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
-1975090233
scarcely controvert."
2082351283

-1923438341
"Produce him--or go to hell."
1725869459

-1923438341
"I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the
740342191
goodness to step forward."
622610564

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too, a
-1609866739
sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
-997322419
spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame.  The second
1970159624
stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
-2035706472
pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason
113649776
himself.  Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him.  His eye, as I have
964879438
often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
646105307
its gloom; and his face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead
924063081
received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he stirred,
-1703262691
lifted his strong arm--he could have struck Mason, dashed him on the
2003628846
church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body--but
1152053754
Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!"  Contempt fell cool on
374087218
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he
-890968569
only asked--"What have _you_ to say?"
-1968912414

-1923438341
An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
-1242349077

-1923438341
"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand,
2009494299
what have you to say?"
1268577303

-1923438341
"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a sacred
2027005386
place."  Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you aware, sir,
-1753348781
whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
674881441

-1923438341
"Courage," urged the lawyer,--"speak out."
273769538

-1923438341
"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
2047616027
tones: "I saw her there last April.  I am her brother."
1556559552

-1923438341
"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman.  "Impossible!  I am an
-297967774
old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
131031249
Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
1665414282

-1923438341
I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered--
800363946

-1923438341
"No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under
-1525746821
that name."  He mused--for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
-31426073
formed his resolve, and announced it--
-645605087

-1923438341
"Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
-441055407
Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
-575276615
clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day."  The man
457324827
obeyed.
1977273986

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
862294969
word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
-1084322899
me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better
1585626449
than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
-1997397206
deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
-1698592855
fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this
225992581
lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to
144829207
whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
-580995620
the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined
1481896320
your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch
1044718443
and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister:
-1919665173
some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I
-1259920056
married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute
1491443551
personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing
91490283
you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd
-1697567863
almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came
-1013601814
of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her
-712767254
mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out
-1167036010
after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets
1033081356
before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.
-1715842731
I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy
2082277343
man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly,
-1705095783
if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs,
1992187065
Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs.
-530777987
Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was
-1895040029
cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break
1947522093
the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This
270808193
girl," he continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
-735318886
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt
-1702094096
she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded
1299652622
wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of
502875174
you--follow!"
2061332151

-1923438341
Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
-1614732133
after.  At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
-2095140995

-1923438341
"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
-1213346293
will not be wanted to-day."
1788214780

-1923438341
At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and
304233008
greet us.
1575188597

-1923438341
"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
1194057271
congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too
830260350
late!"
29707874

-1923438341
He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
329683407
beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did.  We mounted the
-279878102
first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
1518148886
the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to
-681795294
the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
-2066097154

-1923438341
"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
-1016667243
here."
608907773

-1923438341
He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
824594680
too, he opened.  In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
-1164771737
by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
994617520
chain.  Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a
-1810454143
saucepan.  In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
-755646520
ran backwards and forwards.  What it was, whether beast or human being,
-1167951373
one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
77890444
fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was
-1016731814
covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a
1210904806
mane, hid its head and face.
-262460135

-1923438341
"Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester.  "How are you? and how is
668306239
your charge to-day?"
1166482742

-1923438341
"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
711325306
mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
362922117

-1923438341
A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the clothed
32100199
hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
1851971359

-1923438341
"Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
-1122097075

-1923438341
"Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
-888480997

-1923438341
"Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!"
-1041290345

-1923438341
The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
-1302089664
gazed wildly at her visitors.  I recognised well that purple face,--those
-188948815
bloated features.  Mrs. Poole advanced.
1453590327

-1923438341
"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she has
-215127922
no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
270724088

-1923438341
"One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
-2022817548
mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
335308905

-1923438341
"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
-605698678

-1923438341
"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
541750674

-1923438341
"'Ware!" cried Grace.  The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously.  Mr.
-1949849915
Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his throat
1519825352
viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled.  She was a
1866747646
big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
-1594823335
besides: she showed virile force in the contest--more than once she
457147117
almost throttled him, athletic as he was.  He could have settled her with
-1032060044
a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only wrestle.  At
692716033
last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
1492980407
them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a
-370681544
chair.  The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the
-906276879
most convulsive plunges.  Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he
1364782948
looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
-1428953553

-1923438341
"That is _my wife_," said he.  "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
-1853411009
ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
903411302
hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
1149501976
shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
805948082
of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just
-1868964446
as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the
-814306013
difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this
3226178
face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
1579740292
the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
2018672962
ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize."
1354991733

-1923438341
We all withdrew.  Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
-1118704426
further order to Grace Poole.  The solicitor addressed me as he descended
1793607204
the stair.
689846779

-1923438341
"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
-1136116143
glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason
1436318090
returns to Madeira."
-1794666915

-1923438341
"My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?"
-209193507

-1923438341
"Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
-1411146858
house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating
1313608613
the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who
1279381938
was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica,
2011211863
happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he
1396449180
knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of
-1041150919
Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose,
1642503081
revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is
-464992406
now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
-1902621976
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
-1190644083
ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you
-776975230
from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to
873320266
lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred
-1591062125
him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not
-1144356796
too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain
1001536662
that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to
821349683
accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in
1011298028
England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we
1059890630
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
-2043727035

-1923438341
"No, no--let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
-642404373
take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.  The
1448229550
clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
2060461104
reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
1508853652

-1923438341
I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which
1296181916
I had now withdrawn.  The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the
966957170
bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I
-387124661
was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding
-1454719034
dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I
-1032443077
thought, for the last time.  I then sat down: I felt weak and tired.  I
2008139735
leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.  And now I
-542072150
thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down
1898223687
where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open
1725300109
beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I thought_.
591425173

-1923438341
The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene
965862526
with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there
-1147411983
was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance
1986526724
or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly
-386697748
pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions
-369323169
put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an
-424061183
open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the
-1156996886
living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
-1296662240

-1923438341
I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change:
-1169741912
nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.  And yet where was
943503654
the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her life?--where were her
1708705351
prospects?
-1167808726

-1923438341
Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a
-1821005342
cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
769422736
desolate.  A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
-1602632835
storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
-1786865919
the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
31491805
which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
885646887
untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
-1523414379
flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
-1952326578
white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.  My hopes were all dead--struck
-166360477
with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in
325180122
the land of Egypt.  I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
707723106
blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
-1646770868
never revive.  I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
-621521212
master's--which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering
981808688
child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not
1167577819
seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast.
1940692637
Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
-1092978663
destroyed!  Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not
2008628947
what I had thought him.  I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say
-1279183153
he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from
-349118146
his idea, and from his presence I must go: _that_ I perceived well.
1050959168
When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted
1424679776
not, would hurry me from Thornfield.  Real affection, it seemed, he could
1174070153
not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he
-2095010941
would want me no more.  I should fear even to cross his path now: my view
-899196164
must be hateful to him.  Oh, how blind had been my eyes!  How weak my
1688879586
conduct!
6047746

-1923438341
My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
-97432263
me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.  Self-abandoned,
176437011
relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up
-951476807
bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and
352961197
felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to flee I had no strength.
1557461054
I lay faint, longing to be dead.  One idea only still throbbed life-like
1858870101
within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these
57438637
words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that
-1249465825
should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them--
-1803565028

-1923438341
"Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
767979787

-1923438341
It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I
-206318763
had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it
2039443991
came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.  The whole
-1626759502
consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
-2048695587
death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.  That
828635887
bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my soul;
-2013685243
I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the
-1602547321
floods overflowed me."
1184573194

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXVII
-1505065122

-1923438341

-1923438341
Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing
1126569602
the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,
-1842671513
"What am I to do?"
565088046

-1923438341
But the answer my mind gave--"Leave Thornfield at once"--was so prompt,
-112257345
so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words
-2012971130
now.  "That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my
-267663987
woe," I alleged: "that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and
-1275007951
found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but
-1701299327
that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I
-750257306
cannot do it."
-1921704083

-1923438341
But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that
651517497
I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak
-1121771228
that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out
2043137365
for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told
2063807186
her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in the slough, and
-1672901647
swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her down to unsounded
541187312
depths of agony.
-1049503218

-1923438341
"Let me be torn away," then I cried.  "Let another help me!"
1839860063

-1923438341
"No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall
-1134243510
yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your
1344795590
heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it."
1664751582

-1923438341
I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a
-994686992
judge haunted,--at the silence which so awful a voice filled.  My head
1380426569
swam as I stood erect.  I perceived that I was sickening from excitement
-114205367
and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I
1822624889
had taken no breakfast.  And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that,
869960513
long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I
304153267
was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at
533119436
the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.  "Friends always forget
1868453546
those whom fortune forsakes," I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed
1828890541
out.  I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was
-1706464095
dim, and my limbs were feeble.  I could not soon recover myself.  I fell,
878816582
but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me.  I looked up--I
-2047723503
was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber
-1969550921
threshold.
1469840487

-1923438341
"You come out at last," he said.  "Well, I have been waiting for you
1875183872
long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five
131399888
minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock
1977741533
like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone!
-108302303
I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are
-770989393
passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot
1386663349
rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a
2063174560
senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I
188994257
err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but
-1827012496
no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?"
-658764726

-1923438341
"Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant?
-382400392
Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I
2116341568
have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look."
462442496

-1923438341
"Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one
-187680762
little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread
1258830542
and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake
-864899874
slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder
-1583315629
more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?"
1690025381

-1923438341
Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep
-1435822039
remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his
865673434
manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and
1232707797
mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my
-415734082
heart's core.
-1914289737

-1923438341
"You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?" ere long he inquired
271661726
wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,
-407904116
the result rather of weakness than of will.
2093422365

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me."
-2132375313

-1923438341
"I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water."  He heaved a sort of
-1582285617
shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.  At
-264634122
first I did not know to what room he had borne me; all was cloudy to my
633704472
glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer
655693768
as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.  He put wine to my lips;
1299303356
I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he offered me, and was soon
1634858900
myself.  I was in the library--sitting in his chair--he was quite near.
2082749952
"If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be
196298055
well for me," I thought; "then I should not have to make the effort of
-1179211344
cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I
314914265
must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave
1711012754
him."
-1495546105

-1923438341
"How are you now, Jane?"
-661720127

-1923438341
"Much better, sir; I shall be well soon."
-1011717775

-1923438341
"Taste the wine again, Jane."
-1985933591

-1923438341
I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and
1041408285
looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate
-1139235175
exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast
1607917307
through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;
1917958412
but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and
-577440221
put his aside.
-202256632

-1923438341
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily.  "Oh, I know! you won't kiss
823595716
the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces
163484419
appropriated?"
476248777

-1923438341
"At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir."
1814179312

-1923438341
"Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer
492567843
for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess
1532388753
rightly?"
958145104

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard
1737921118
me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating
1732448973
disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid,
-470974783
and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to
-497896131
that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still,
-972569668
and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you
543827928
cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the
578195416
flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke
-1667673874
much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene:
-1649493197
you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I
443325539
know you--I am on my guard."
613667690

-1923438341
"Sir, I do not wish to act against you," I said; and my unsteady voice
1657076530
warned me to curtail my sentence.
-2145451977

-1923438341
"Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy
-1897244603
me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man
-676582883
you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss
679328855
me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under
-279293055
this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to
-1410669667
you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will
-29600523
say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock
1097671025
to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become."
130996082

-1923438341
I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: "All is changed about me, sir;
-309498289
I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations
1747415292
of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations,
-960319760
there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir."
841591513

-1923438341
"Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean
530521151
to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of
167490597
Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent
-1794521737
vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open
1771409868
sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion
-131377522
of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was
-1560698472
wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was
-1833125021
haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all
-1587644249
knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never
-599395135
would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was
2145888125
housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac
482370691
elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more
1544981562
retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely
-86360799
enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in
318829357
the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
-150407030
Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to
-244316912
each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect
1737345519
assassination, even of what I most hate.
-1592715496

-1923438341
"Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was
1002825334
something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a
-2026568529
upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll
195321245
shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower
-215943512
windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my
-476517516
wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and
277131094
she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her
1308066367
company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_
-370799224
is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to
770770329
stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--"
1415770607

-1923438341
"Sir," I interrupted him, "you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady:
-1214555936
you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she
-724839532
cannot help being mad."
634275419

-1923438341
"Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't
429072654
know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because
1382084121
she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?"
977549136

-1923438341
"I do indeed, sir."
-1410193255

-1923438341
"Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about
130044027
the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as
-1436986374
dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your
114992247
mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure
-2050742617
still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait
-1409210857
waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you
2053642736
flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you
1952857889
in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not
1458717173
shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you
-1819179552
should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you
89684634
with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and
-1809563549
never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of
-223480632
recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was
-1622106260
talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for
581314453
prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one
458330530
more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and
-194966407
terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure
-1730315501
sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from
-208736732
falsehood and slander."
-137200728

-1923438341
"And take Adele with you, sir," I interrupted; "she will be a companion
-1265660496
for you."
420384552

-1923438341
"What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and
419175911
what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a
286367215
French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why
417898944
do you assign Adele to me for a companion?"
-392611615

-1923438341
"You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull:
459390922
too dull for you."
-747720760

-1923438341
"Solitude! solitude!" he reiterated with irritation.  "I see I must come
2094554281
to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming
1225385268
in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?"
1514228362

-1923438341
I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he was
1443778293
becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.  He had been walking
-746744504
fast about the room, and he stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
-96305862
He looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on
1613336327
the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
-54826394

-1923438341
"Now for the hitch in Jane's character," he said at last, speaking more
-68895
calmly than from his look I had expected him to speak.  "The reel of silk
1321654073
has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot
-196790534
and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and
1738299492
endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's
258805584
strength, and break the entanglement like tow!"
-1187968831

-1923438341
He recommenced his walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just
2119699851
before me.
365804247

-1923438341
"Jane! will you hear reason?" (he stooped and approached his lips to my
-1172651069
ear); "because, if you won't, I'll try violence."  His voice was hoarse;
-1578740703
his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond
1689788350
and plunge headlong into wild license.  I saw that in another moment, and
543131267
with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him.
-1797228781
The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to
-1798630442
control and restrain him--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would
789385182
have sealed my doom,--and his.  But I was not afraid: not in the least.  I
776597826
felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.  The
-1422199711
crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian,
1300560566
perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe.  I took hold of
-213903814
his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him,
704445509
soothingly--
-2124622798

-1923438341
"Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to
-995989447
say, whether reasonable or unreasonable."
-1573708428

-1923438341
He sat down: but he did not get leave to speak directly.  I had been
15881301
struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress
2113013829
them, because I knew he would not like to see me weep.  Now, however, I
672679571
considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
872599267
If the flood annoyed him, so much the better.  So I gave way and cried
366844830
heartily.
-447326226

-1923438341
Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed.  I said I could
784379042
not while he was in such a passion.
766104394

-1923438341
"But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled
-1140115013
your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not
87198920
endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes."
-1911410218

-1923438341
His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,
-1050110075
became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but
344035985
I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.
-353631141

-1923438341
"Jane! Jane!" he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled
-1399198510
along every nerve I had; "you don't love me, then?  It was only my
1278448009
station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me
-219857819
disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I
95065881
were some toad or ape."
-1706067100

-1923438341
These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to
1746450790
have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at
73658112
thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm
2026117362
where I had wounded.
-429344083

-1923438341
"I _do_ love you," I said, "more than ever: but I must not show or
-1396193936
indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it."
1636485080

-1923438341
"The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see
-1751648459
me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?"
-257207509

-1923438341
"No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
-765730144
one way: but you will be furious if I mention it."
-1927276804

-1923438341
"Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping."
1308895724

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I must leave you."
-1785444224

-1923438341
"For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which
-1954434547
is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?"
1526793283

-1923438341
"I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole
-1450910216
life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange
-1035472580
scenes."
90496043

-1923438341
"Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting
-1726218140
from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new
1212209938
existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.
-776520470
You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep
351924266
only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in
-693796218
the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the
-487730341
Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most
-2088344873
innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make
-1441082743
you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be
469895742
reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic."
555519597

-1923438341
His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:
-1114100641
still I dared to speak.
990377764

-1923438341
"Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by
-1673744156
yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your
-1411708301
mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false."
338240339

-1923438341
"Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long-
1610151356
enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and
-1214025755
yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!"
-352705036

-1923438341
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his
-67347873
cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
-1766969823
To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel: to
-877739915
yield was out of the question.  I did what human beings do instinctively
-1684189517
when they are driven to utter extremity--looked for aid to one higher
-1798612077
than man: the words "God help me!" burst involuntarily from my lips.
1336369001

-1923438341
"I am a fool!" cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  "I keep telling her I am
1193136667
not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing
-212929548
of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my
1681793313
infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in
1975160056
opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,
-413838952
Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove
-1087075499
you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the
1931185088
case.  Can you listen to me?"
-1817367431

-1923438341
"Yes, sir; for hours if you will."
-547910510

-1923438341
"I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the
-1811200370
eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?"
-1413332399

-1923438341
"I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once."
1944962603

-1923438341
"And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?"
-606144202

-1923438341
"I have understood something to that effect."
-2140410104

-1923438341
"Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property
-219202548
together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving
-883012623
me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
-1950171091
Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I
-1870843835
must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner
1870779301
betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old
822430921
acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made
1074989588
inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned
651194454
from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty
-837075832
thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to
1577490236
Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said
1618885386
nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of
-1362978951
Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine
-1002080465
woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her
-1598139642
family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.
737225430
They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her
-1440640001
alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered
-867311298
me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and
-198746833
accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy
869856517
me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being
1210330641
ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no
-401708684
folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience,
1931353463
the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its
-1760622785
commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she
596964144
allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh,
404462779
I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of
1912889257
inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not
-1809645096
even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her
-2059804457
nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor
1380475710
refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross,
-64193978
grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might
-1958340639
have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking."
1322928034

-1923438341
"My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The
1382599660
honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a
865887773
lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot.
-1859924399
The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor
-1277026871
all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble
-853712474
mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister,
330992087
and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in
1078097896
the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this;
360608918
but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the
970962764
plot against me."
-515689704

-1923438341
"These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of
-663143660
concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife,
-264462622
even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious
-1338015415
to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of
-366101882
being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found
694631483
that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day
288100559
with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained
1468665186
between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from
1498769876
her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I
955388127
perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because
2007157787
no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and
-482404264
unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory,
-1757321624
exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I
-1602024862
curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in
1560194578
secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
-903361419

-1923438341
"Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words
-45997983
shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four
2143764627
years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character
-1139363247
ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast
-1921938197
and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would
1383544307
not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant
-1003467138
propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on
292493562
me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me
625183475
through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man
-2028540727
bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
-2104731144

-1923438341
"My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my
-243413721
father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a
-799093322
nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with
-1722328961
mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not
-817626125
rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered
2056227339
that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs
792766617
of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost
666928050
sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?"
-1908710714

-1923438341
"No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you."
-1055887378

-1923438341
"Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute,
-524262266
which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer
-899363476
it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is
-719016176
a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant
-50506279
contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity,
1178994266
Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this
-2118126886
moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your
1191521738
heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity,
459325729
my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very
-1584320008
natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter
-1028838607
have free advent--my arms wait to receive her."
2036472453

-1923438341
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
1828681958

-1923438341
"Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was
-517857602
all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I
1872363544
was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in
530181226
my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her
-1934380090
crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.
-478851519
Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and
960198972
heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I
-1760803907
breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that
435795292
recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover,
1622629977
I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and
1093616257
better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father
-858130225
had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live
560162486
as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus,
1767196816
at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.
1048726054

-1923438341
"One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had
1530656010
pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery
731939880
West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the
-6046586
hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and
468446644
opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no
1471837137
refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly
137938426
round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull
-1270329020
like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was
-176287733
setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw
-79144651
her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of
1886296962
tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my
-795235284
ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein
-1971371382
she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such
-897653421
language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she:
-1268304339
though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West
329962151
India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.
-357389423

-1923438341
"'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the
1514044511
sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it
-286040384
if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the
668330389
heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity
1551526575
I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present
979704338
one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
-166261910

-1923438341
"I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained
-32056665
a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained
1496139462
the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of
436444351
exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design
-1389694604
of self-destruction, was past in a second.
-1034396882

-1923438341
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open
-1286827925
casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew
-1900023210
pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the
76946569
dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched
62154655
pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics
1884649051
kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true
1169171800
Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to
1984136178
follow.
-11854749

-1923438341
"The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves,
581157210
and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up
-2088319963
and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living
818483814
blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
1701165462
I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch
-686751085
at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the
-1263115704
old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--
1748110074

-1923438341
"'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a
-1078058490
sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may
-204122429
take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and
403069847
precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will,
360480867
and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long-
-817500596
suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted
107488338
your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is
1247365730
cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and
-1894836916
humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself,
-1095008959
be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
1963748321
Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy,
2146888861
and leave her.'
-1578330108

-1923438341
"I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not
1411745620
made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first
575258881
letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to
304484570
experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family
-1169959509
character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I
1088354911
added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous
134357123
conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him
1524559141
blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish
1298747727
the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.
153583601

-1923438341
"To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a
-1471032022
monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield,
-778565452
and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret
-950621055
inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a
33286899
goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it
813335251
was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed;
1625045130
for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid
1304473851
intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me.
-1589339626
At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the
-693400607
surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and
-678815360
worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs.
1803439274
Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no
584160282
precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good
243979393
keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears
1924701379
nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession,
658392305
her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is
-1832000550
both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her
-272283151
guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she
-351446244
stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell,
-1623267450
and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions,
1646446239
she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid
-2089516769
that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you,
-1400959048
that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps
766112033
brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what
33853648
might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the
43848057
thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet
155984907
visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--"
-107221546

-1923438341
"And what, sir," I asked, while he paused, "did you do when you had
-1506391675
settled her here?  Where did you go?"
1313879652

-1923438341
"What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp.
-1437304855
Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the
-1705696204
March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its
52570467
lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent
862604959
woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--"
-1939188207

-1923438341
"But you could not marry, sir."
438366704

-1923438341
"I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not
445639798
my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to
-512864978
tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me
491273448
so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be
-98325685
loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to
1707986832
understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was
2036513753
burdened."
1943314564

-1923438341
"Well, sir?"
-488273056

-1923438341
"When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your
-484683951
eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,
386898531
as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted
1266760959
to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you
-1081393887
mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;
464605213
and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I
1348184556
don't very well know why."
-2128149575

-1923438341
"I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?"
-1646934112

-1923438341
"Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?"
464119419

-1923438341
"Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;
245028773
and what she said."
438836546

-1923438341
"I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her
-1536212635
to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
-850511770
For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then
886991551
another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in
1645285040
Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the
1912184363
passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were
115141642
closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies,
1727013801
French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not
-569281810
find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance,
1458999033
heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream:
1008003908
but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired
-1591682977
perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited
-1126712064
me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them
1433069892
all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of
2093004867
the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have
-1768133961
asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried
-1401635924
dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my
-1755362154
Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me
1207580522
much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to
-1609205813
approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.
1293494452

-1923438341
"Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
-1460148716
The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a
-2122270260
man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was,
381431539
and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an
-14110164
Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly
2002186513
handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was
1876671820
unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was
2075218091
honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to
-572893111
my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a
1752615892
good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see
-1665568379
by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just
-667120189
now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?"
717637093

-1923438341
"I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it
-702803966
not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one
1598917780
mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course."
506011083

-1923438341
"It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of
-1462348446
existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the
1359240582
next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always
1375343888
by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is
-1402122607
degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine,
-193607626
Giacinta, and Clara."
-1300287844

-1923438341
I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain
569942344
inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching
895986488
that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any
-1885542672
justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these
124470958
poor girls, he would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in
-123966300
his mind desecrated their memory.  I did not give utterance to this
-1031176076
conviction: it was enough to feel it.  I impressed it on my heart, that
-1859505438
it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
1942173377

-1923438341
"Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are
701342730
looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to
2077073836
the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame
657532239
of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with
994498903
disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against
1501159000
all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual,
911249175
faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came
-1719601296
back to England.
1344116040

-1923438341
"On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.
1937419596
Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in
-945259341
Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as
-1040094257
negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no
836420473
presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the
-1240722509
arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble
2001930175
guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's
-240398743
accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender
-991915928
creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to
1124524890
bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it
-2025457123
stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort
-432474617
of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.
-398512152

-1923438341
"When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap
-844988391
and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf
1144222598
must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could
408454263
not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind
1931682036
the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that
-2081208430
night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or
1288221026
watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an-
197787293
hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I
-1231508186
recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door
-399835209
was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward
535980489
attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but
-1061369725
you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and
1430008656
amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once
-671264702
into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now
-1813267477
and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling
-664689525
snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and
-297993485
dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a
-1144487608
pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in
828048645
your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding:
1154414021
your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit
-1376237709
follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
810596355
The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened
-662929036
you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was
786004289
much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of
-1295045411
your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very
2108918321
well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy
-49135989
sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly
292564092
aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather
-1812521254
black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs.
415984880
Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or
1860450406
something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting
817214911
out of my sight.
1887904874

-1923438341
"Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my
-599944037
presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was
-1138733647
yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the
-459066158
room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly
-717755372
dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full
-62869785
of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your
-1275143273
air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature,
818107251
but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making
-713363496
herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet
-535150854
when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your
707489115
interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you
-2131823090
gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
517068620
Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence
1121679204
of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was
-1799313527
astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your
-713921315
manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or
-931355323
displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at
578231855
me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once
1816703181
content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and
-1597940044
wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and
1618367869
sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to
-1452581399
prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance:
-951537406
besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I
-86472707
handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of
-354264167
freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory
-1689177649
blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an
1422126773
indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me
2135958374
if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as
-1623939736
your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon,
4185180
and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
-289956746
Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not
1188083747
despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little
-173964009
hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if
732708899
you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.
-1076973733

-1923438341
"I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance,
-217641317
and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social
1117178312
heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that
-1435083807
made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;
-618284152
kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your
1864644674
tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy
-434129000
accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:
-693936791
there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a
-260334104
slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might
-944291064
be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend
1069043748
and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first
-1109797327
whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light
-19254113
and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to
-436000832
avoid straining you then and there to my heart."
650202075

-1923438341
"Don't talk any more of those days, sir," I interrupted, furtively
1231848394
dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for
-488536305
I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and
-975563703
these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.
-1647251709

-1923438341
"No, Jane," he returned: "what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,
1633723652
when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?"
-1330407948

-1923438341
I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.
1303593181

-1923438341
"You see now how the case stands--do you not?" he continued.  "After a
-635010959
youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary
-547400958
solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have
1417713469
found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am
80016004
bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely:
263993572
a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you,
-943684057
draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you,
1829124330
and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
-307971786

-1923438341
"It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To
-1389599997
tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I
1657072950
had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I
1836165864
feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early
-1624177780
instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding
-943110269
confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness
438575816
and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of
-610675884
agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier
1001003663
existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my
1925678713
resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and
2103375862
well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge
-1973396735
of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now."
1303445781

-1923438341
A pause.
527314172

-1923438341
"Why are you silent, Jane?"
1218528973

-1923438341
I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
192659869
Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being
18199105
that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him
1822439877
who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and
-2069350142
idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--"Depart!"
-2067239925

-1923438341
"Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be
-1952212433
yours, Mr. Rochester.'"
-825250384

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours."
2037429224

-1923438341
Another long silence.
-1982284950

-1923438341
"Jane!" recommenced he, with a gentleness that broke me down with grief,
-832731861
and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was
1039902382
the pant of a lion rising--"Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world,
1453369467
and to let me go another?"
29315708

-1923438341
"I do."
-1848289778

-1923438341
"Jane" (bending towards and embracing me), "do you mean it now?"
2002145704

-1923438341
"I do."
-1848289778

-1923438341
"And now?" softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
1393288760

-1923438341
"I do," extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
-1744403042

-1923438341
"Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked
1322608536
to love me."
2000533787

-1923438341
"It would to obey you."
1146492722

-1923438341
A wild look raised his brows--crossed his features: he rose; but he
166402756
forebore yet.  I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I
-997096043
shook, I feared--but I resolved.
244330870

-1923438341
"One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are
-307036851
gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For
485054249
a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some
-1990830758
corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a
-291303667
companion and for some hope?"
1211992695

-1923438341
"Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet
-1742836004
again there."
-488579104

-1923438341
"Then you will not yield?"
480120348

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?"  His voice
-1193108153
rose.
-612146562

-1923438341
"I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil."
508862006

-1923438341
"Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust
1613790580
for a passion--vice for an occupation?"
1844092392

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for
-600433929
myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You
1500333584
will forget me before I forget you."
1838852024

-1923438341
"You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I
-1589107500
could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a
-1404197757
distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved
-922645714
by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than
1323595866
to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for
-717628263
you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend
279854085
by living with me?"
-1549182333

-1923438341
This was true: and while he spoke my very conscience and reason turned
-978800463
traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him.  They
-2128458059
spoke almost as loud as Feeling: and that clamoured wildly.  "Oh,
-930254256
comply!" it said.  "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his
284083517
state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the
1961191808
recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell
-259122554
him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or
2116389324
who will be injured by what you do?"
-606642321

-1923438341
Still indomitable was the reply--"_I_ care for myself.  The more
1299599687
solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will
-1592353092
respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I
1880695176
will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not
1445431005
mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there
-1822824418
is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul
-406535911
rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they
-1374660418
shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would
300341001
be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I
-1490983653
cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my
1157953802
veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its
1329434166
throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have
1689849036
at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot."
-726913822

-1923438341
I did.  Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so.  His
328750863
fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment,
-1684268216
whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my
-582931647
waist.  He seemed to devour me with his flaming glance: physically, I
-103748397
felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow
1301868855
of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the
1606349223
certainty of ultimate safety.  The soul, fortunately, has an
-963073690
interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in
1333912340
the eye.  My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I
2087349367
gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed
1050985913
strength almost exhausted.
-794781534

-1923438341
"Never," said he, as he ground his teeth, "never was anything at once so
-34087803
frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!"  (And he
-529586807
shook me with the force of his hold.)  "I could bend her with my finger
-1595127702
and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed
1342833120
her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking
812175022
out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
-1090319610
Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful
-1656216410
creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only
687175728
let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate
-792527446
would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay
1769930925
dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue
-1659495391
and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you
-2003702306
could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would:
-2139787836
seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you
-746855296
will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!"
-2003409789

-1923438341
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
-1580427462
The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot,
-101967226
however, would have succumbed now.  I had dared and baffled his fury; I
-1473420922
must elude his sorrow: I retired to the door.
-756220242

-1923438341
"You are going, Jane?"
-218912403

-1923438341
"I am going, sir."
822309356

-1923438341
"You are leaving me?"
314811975

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep
438587583
love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?"
137274930

-1923438341
What unutterable pathos was in his voice!  How hard it was to reiterate
2080051111
firmly, "I am going."
-1656230744

-1923438341
"Jane!"
-1019869867

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester!"
-1637393207

-1923438341
"Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish.
2141098145
Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a
1087800857
glance on my sufferings--think of me."
-1690401962

-1923438341
He turned away; he threw himself on his face on the sofa.  "Oh, Jane! my
-26023010
hope--my love--my life!" broke in anguish from his lips.  Then came a
1094650817
deep, strong sob.
837611243

-1923438341
I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as
599469255
determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face
214970911
from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my
-671320412
hand.
-235601256

-1923438341
"God bless you, my dear master!" I said.  "God keep you from harm and
885126337
wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to
-1890266986
me."
-1799624218

-1923438341
"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward," he answered;
1136659200
"without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love:
1679548580
yes--nobly, generously."
-1881690066

-1923438341
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes;
2080622623
erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at
1247223144
once quitted the room.
2123479394

-1923438341
"Farewell!" was the cry of my heart as I left him.  Despair added,
-2107491845
"Farewell for ever!"
1224352260

-1923438341
* * * * *
-1683987654

-1923438341
That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as
1822697093
I lay down in bed.  I was transported in thought to the scenes of
2098661207
childhood: I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night
-1648819854
was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.  The light that long
-947810256
ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly
-77341739
to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured
1008011048
ceiling.  I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high
-1274773508
and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours she is about
410555782
to sever.  I watched her come--watched with the strangest anticipation;
1290079766
as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk.  She broke
853315148
forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the
188342230
sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form
-1205966775
shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.  It gazed and
-1339414297
gazed on me.  It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone,
18562657
yet so near, it whispered in my heart--
-395630807

-1923438341
"My daughter, flee temptation."
967143296

-1923438341
"Mother, I will."
1616701302

-1923438341
So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream.  It was yet
2104673595
night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.  "It
1829629612
cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil," thought I.  I
229908011
rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.  I knew
-1866249019
where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring.  In seeking
236260482
these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester
1198320275
had forced me to accept a few days ago.  I left that; it was not mine: it
806980267
was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.  The other articles I
954437805
made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I
-1192411438
had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl,
1040820275
took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole
172316734
from my room.
-829960544

-1923438341
"Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" I whispered, as I glided past her door.
702001092
"Farewell, my darling Adele!" I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
-898200339
No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her.  I had to
-85251877
deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
1141292697

-1923438341
I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my
-1590104835
heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced
1448520983
to stop also.  No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from
-355548104
wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I listened.  There was
538105751
a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but
1448730849
to go in and to say--
-1590508282

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till
-1765749096
death," and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.  I thought of
-199237538
this.
315565887

-1923438341
That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience
-1780487159
for day.  He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.  He
-922883149
would have me sought for: vainly.  He would feel himself forsaken; his
535799001
love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.  I thought of
-855796107
this too.  My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided
1992921938
on.
1177724319

-1923438341
Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it
-1832920108
mechanically.  I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I
-339028669
sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
-404583564
I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk
-1246236450
far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.  All
1766114959
this I did without one sound.  I opened the door, passed out, shut it
1073810974
softly.  Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.  The great gates were closed and
1621181178
locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched.  Through that I
-1584018775
departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
1963274053

-1923438341
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary
106763514
direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed,
1401845032
and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.  No reflection was to
172814555
be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.
-1216921286
Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.  The
-1838210709
first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line
518490729
of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.  The last was
-1390326869
an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.
-275981752

-1923438341
I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.  I believe it
-2041888033
was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I
737208995
left the house, were soon wet with dew.  But I looked neither to rising
203052574
sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.  He who is taken out to pass
-1544712997
through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that
-203898712
smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of
-2089303881
bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear
-1638905011
flight and homeless wandering--and oh! with agony I thought of what I
-1349385066
left.  I could not help it.  I thought of him now--in his room--watching
-2036649595
the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and
-1315520382
be his.  I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I
14949802
could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.  As yet my flight, I
-1174186226
was sure, was undiscovered.  I could go back and be his comforter--his
585425995
pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.  Oh, that fear of his
275397848
self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me!  It
-1826847494
was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract
-1992744097
it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.  Birds began
-1311984781
singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds
1797129384
were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and
-637356313
frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from
1840992556
self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had
1893729423
injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I
366195690
could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my
-1828033548
own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled
-1286851527
the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,
-1155597206
fast I went like one delirious.  A weakness, beginning inwardly,
105770882
extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some
-874218015
minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.  I had some fear--or hope--that
2072855748
here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and
1329083957
knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as
-1033729432
ever to reach the road.
1741456104

-1923438341
When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and
2095498677
while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.  I stood up and
-879489365
lifted my hand; it stopped.  I asked where it was going: the driver named
695615160
a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no
1464622001
connections.  I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty
1354053979
shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.
-101837502
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was
1720201421
empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
-1110384163

-1923438341
Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt!  May your eyes never
17089383
shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.  May
-538353107
you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in
480133810
that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the
1128434070
instrument of evil to what you wholly love.

CHAPTER XXVIII
-1392206066

-1923438341

-1923438341
Two days are passed.  It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
-1233833548
down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum
771762832
I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
1648719777
The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone.  At this moment I
1413152528
discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach,
1926317919
where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain;
-1590658565
and now, I am absolutely destitute.
-2071057963

-1923438341
Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up
-1135053287
where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a
267467555
distance and in darkness.  Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest
-1986245911
town to which these point is, according to the inscription, distant ten
639501122
miles; the farthest, above twenty.  From the well-known names of these
119652055
towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk
-344983146
with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.  There are great moors
-1386512440
behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond
-1300075157
that deep valley at my feet.  The population here must be thin, and I see
-232355349
no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and
-1624778910
south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the
1502060790
heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.  Yet a chance traveller
2019923733
might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder
1753782114
what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless
-1077909423
and lost.  I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would
-806363665
sound incredible and excite suspicion.  Not a tie holds me to human
571512149
society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my
1291310866
fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a
-101501279
good wish for me.  I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I
-1698012422
will seek her breast and ask repose.
-511362479

-1923438341
I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
559548794
furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
-1703903227
turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a
868555525
hidden angle, I sat down under it.  High banks of moor were about me; the
963647715
crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
2047583141

-1923438341
Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
-1850498261
that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
-1272897235
discover me.  If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
-849570727
was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
596946460
Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
-248357536
silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
-1527235365
As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I
-1726012162
regained the faculty of reflection.
1719089340

-1923438341
What was I to do?  Where to go?  Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
-1792096099
do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my
314402815
weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold
-2136056313
charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
-1697978631
sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
-42881565
could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
-416779561

-1923438341
I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer
1173683172
day.  I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above
-2026336373
the chasm ridge.  The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze
-78518525
whispered.  Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me,
269542479
outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust,
-791053164
rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.  To-night, at
-1165131118
least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me
773434078
without money and without price.  I had one morsel of bread yet: the
850934498
remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a
-643982466
stray penny--my last coin.  I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and
-1303983650
there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them
-967201326
with the bread.  My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased
-1180954280
by this hermit's meal.  I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and
-2121236613
then chose my couch.
1606042727

-1923438341
{I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg}
856464631

-1923438341
Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
1752691514
buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
-1642267673
the night-air to invade.  I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me
1938914321
for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.  Thus lodged, I was
-111466428
not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold.
1103498767

-1923438341
My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.  It
501834868
plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.  It
-815564428
trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
905132474
pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
-293387517
with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
1125875923
attempts to seek him.
-1065505767

-1923438341
Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.  Night was
-1712671288
come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the
343001830
companionship of fear.  We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we
-946635382
feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread
-2039340101
before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel
-1533929422
their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His
-100768903
omnipotence, His omnipresence.  I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr.
1132133414
Rochester.  Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky-
-618914678
way.  Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space
286951995
like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.  Sure
-1647241837
was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew that
-1310906144
neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.  I turned
1436490370
my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of
2103060420
spirits.  Mr. Rochester was safe; he was God's, and by God would he be
1049977383
guarded.  I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in
225999617
sleep forgot sorrow.
-2061565817

-1923438341
But next day, Want came to me pale and bare.  Long after the little birds
2083116210
had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day
-682077999
to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning
1266482430
shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky--I got up, and I
-1195303802
looked round me.
-513065205

-1923438341
What a still, hot, perfect day!  What a golden desert this spreading
735349101
moor!  Everywhere sunshine.  I wished I could live in it and on it.  I
789788525
saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
1691491979
bilberries.  I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I
-63056650
might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.  But I was a
-1967485355
human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there
-253696101
was nothing to supply them.  I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.
1572157067
Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night
1911248206
thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary
2096343333
frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to
-714512274
decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
-47491445
Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and
1163447986
pains, and responsibilities.  The burden must be carried; the want
955286050
provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled.  I set
550311804
out.
-1860730489

-1923438341
Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent
-731441164
and high.  By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice.  I
-1818490145
walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and
-170018762
might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered
700709532
me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw
-2140041797
near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb--I
2038212600
heard a bell chime--a church bell.
-1261927927

-1923438341
I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
-1271440602
hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a
28027363
hamlet and a spire.  All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-
1113550170
fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag
178673078
through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre
1147974882
woodland, the clear and sunny lea.  Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to
-1188471263
the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill,
647656549
and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.  Human life and human
1125536204
labour were near.  I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil
-1812702148
like the rest.
-517765368

-1923438341
About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.  At the bottom of its one
-852324585
street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.  I
-1711352185
coveted a cake of bread.  With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a
-879310470
degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.  The wish
-1247671576
to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was
-972335877
amongst my fellow-beings.  I felt it would be degrading to faint with
-1072196900
hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.  Had I nothing about me I could offer
-1497703097
in exchange for one of these rolls?  I considered.  I had a small silk
-1660114918
handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.  I could hardly tell
-1220195071
how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.  I did not
-326272056
know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they
-1312616428
would not; but I must try.
-1948538091

-1923438341
I entered the shop: a woman was there.  Seeing a respectably-dressed
-1935630337
person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.  How
-1925860414
could she serve me?  I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
-1877576329
the request I had prepared.  I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
582680341
the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.  I only
-167199030
begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.  Disappointed in
-1027959421
the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.  She
1522064667
pointed to a seat; I sank into it.  I felt sorely urged to weep; but
-445485218
conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
-1875888455
it.  Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in
695999466
the village?"
891822850

-1923438341
"Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for."
186142638

-1923438341
I reflected.  I was driven to the point now.  I was brought face to face
-1848370853
with Necessity.  I stood in the position of one without a resource,
-1336620068
without a friend, without a coin.  I must do something.  What?  I must
-534606196
apply somewhere.  Where?
-846056442

-1923438341
"Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
-1051644103
wanted?"
-1369534854

-1923438341
"Nay; she couldn't say."
161053751

-1923438341
"What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people
-1835679045
do?"
-1492966218

-1923438341
"Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
-1440719194
needle-factory, and at the foundry."
658122475

-1923438341
"Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
20231950

-1923438341
"Nay; it was men's work."
288152563

-1923438341
"And what do the women do?"
-1853784109

-1923438341
"I knawn't," was the answer.  "Some does one thing, and some another.
1084973867
Poor folk mun get on as they can."
1745966057

-1923438341
She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to
264756650
importune her?  A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
-1925281334
wanted.  I took leave.
124770723

-1923438341
I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right
-1314487033
hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
41424734
inducement to enter any.  I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
1898922859
a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.  Much
1571350483
exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
-643267370
into a lane and sat down under the hedge.  Ere many minutes had elapsed,
30084690
I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a
-714607576
resource, or at least an informant.  A pretty little house stood at the
1213486674
top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
502524226
brilliantly blooming.  I stopped at it.  What business had I to approach
543507717
the white door or touch the glittering knocker?  In what way could it
-402650083
possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
-1965531893
Yet I drew near and knocked.  A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman
623776165
opened the door.  In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless
-1042459074
heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked
269568684
if a servant was wanted here?
-2076451210

-1923438341
"No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
34393485

-1923438341
"Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I continued.
2145660301
"I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work:
-1406488063
no matter what."
1865767094

-1923438341
But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
2011578587
besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
-565370113
position, tale.  She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
513697691
information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it
426844709
shut me out.  If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I should
-1039868260
have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
952280425

-1923438341
I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
510169574
prospect of aid was visible.  I should have longed rather to deviate to a
-187053074
wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
-645104560
inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
-659253856
cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance
-1577338151
of food.  Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture,
1721709916
hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
-865344632

-1923438341
I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
858575313
wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to
-1369351261
ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.  Meantime, the
-795179106
afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving
-545818191
dog.  In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened
1556821128
towards it.  Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a
-1013880897
well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.  I
-1929564095
remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no
640442768
friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for
-688607890
introduction and aid.  It is the clergyman's function to help--at least
-987143736
with advice--those who wished to help themselves.  I seemed to have
-751935180
something like a right to seek counsel here.  Renewing then my courage,
-288492974
and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.  I reached the
1803094126
house, and knocked at the kitchen-door.  An old woman opened: I asked was
1375282951
this the parsonage?
1701189568

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Was the clergyman in?"
855713201

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Would he be in soon?"
683732457

-1923438341
"No, he was gone from home."
-1752174354

-1923438341
"To a distance?"
-409520897

-1923438341
"Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden
-1920377478
death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay
1092272686
there a fortnight longer."
-83445996

-1923438341
"Was there any lady of the house?"
-847400980

-1923438341
"Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
1865297457
reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
-1782757756
sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
2107591909

-1923438341
Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of
1630250395
bread in the little shop.  Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to
-2022547620
allay the pang of famine!  Instinctively I turned my face again to the
638542881
village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were
-1532017701
there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll
663444136
for this handkerchief?"
468395903

-1923438341
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
-1587027828
that way."
-1334882983

-1923438341
Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused.  "How could
2139838636
she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
1170875110

-1923438341
"Would she take my gloves?"
-1880188044

-1923438341
"No! what could she do with them?"
-1142188770

-1923438341
Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.  Some say there is
-1264863717
enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
-93169934
can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
-298210078
degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
479767953
recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.  I blamed none of those who
-1377202915
repulsed me.  I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
564167544
be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
-677417622
well-dressed beggar inevitably so.  To be sure, what I begged was
-1520243835
employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?  Not,
-120330253
certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who
-1244618570
knew nothing about my character.  And as to the woman who would not take
-410520625
my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if the
-82899246
offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable.  Let me
418313890
condense now.  I am sick of the subject.
1935683453

-1923438341
A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the
-640070600
farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese.  I stopped and
1358997045
said--
-476569688

-1923438341
"Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry."  He cast on me
-1794667926
a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice from
-163926340
his loaf, and gave it to me.  I imagine he did not think I was a beggar,
1739546405
but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown
-2126584174
loaf.  As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down and ate it.
530583855

-1923438341
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood
1044978776
I have before alluded to.  But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the
-1377685995
ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more
262866600
than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of
-1484778607
safety or tranquillity befriended me.  Towards morning it rained; the
1382845916
whole of the following day was wet.  Do not ask me, reader, to give a
-198133614
minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was
-1036979422
repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.  At the
-1344910317
door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold
1455495705
porridge into a pig trough.  "Will you give me that?" I asked.
751247100

-1923438341
{"Will you give me that?"  I asked: p316.jpg}
1748795521

-1923438341
She stared at me.  "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to
-1850814891
give her these porridge."
-1161996

-1923438341
"Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar.  T'
1449794975
pig doesn't want it."
1252893764

-1923438341
The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
242563665
ravenously.
1607436221

-1923438341
As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which
-587585303
I had been pursuing an hour or more.
-227929187

-1923438341
"My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy.  "I feel I
801937780
cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While
-1904031070
the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I
337282050
fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very
1820097550
dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense
-1200999778
of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood,
-1285549060
though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself
228503889
to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
-258828431
Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of
204239248
want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh,
-1995681348
Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!"
-356910210

-1923438341
My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape.  I saw I had
-496567859
strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.  The very
1691393761
cultivation surrounding it had disappeared.  I had, by cross-ways and by-
-1229056516
paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few
-1007767867
fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were
1000266781
scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
1594946678

-1923438341
"Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
-897946859
road," I reflected.  "And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens
-1358974790
there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
-296374043
they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
1976298917
grave."
1512111431

-1923438341
To the hill, then, I turned.  I reached it.  It remained now only to find
-310588119
a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
-451307206
But all the surface of the waste looked level.  It showed no variation
-1599601770
but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black,
-2041871887
where the dry soil bore only heath.  Dark as it was getting, I could
-727343328
still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and
-1168358712
shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
1635776599

-1923438341
My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
-1033471847
vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among
941416003
the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.  "That is an _ignis
1403275475
fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.  It
1142584301
burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.  "Is
-2041199827
it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned.  I watched to see
2141830278
whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
1776057385
enlarge.  "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
-455840442
so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a
945057241
yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have
-1059115744
it shut in my face."
849968027

-1923438341
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.  I lay
-964708321
still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died
78241377
moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the
-1664303954
skin.  Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly
1446953657
numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
2003422000
but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.  I rose ere
-185708179
long.
731088413

-1923438341
The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.  I
-1943714336
tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.  It
1335598204
led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
1101145953
impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height
-1689513439
of summer.  Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
1540508272
faculties.  This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
2115698942

-1923438341
Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.  I
-1698639270
approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light,
719973106
which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs,
-1937185514
apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms
-1803117689
and foliage through the gloom.  My star vanished as I drew near: some
1227741349
obstacle had intervened between me and it.  I put out my hand to feel the
529517296
dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above
2016813287
it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.  I
195104025
groped on.  Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a
-129344525
wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.  On each side stood a
723269436
sable bush-holly or yew.
-1188446165

-1923438341
Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose
-1788682865
to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
-29603715
nowhere.  All was obscurity.  Were the inmates retired to rest?  I feared
-649148243
it must be so.  In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
-1656563474
the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
1856006631
latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
754348458
growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick
-855381800
over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.  The aperture was
2021416223
so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed
441596129
unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage
757439837
shooting over it, I could see all within.  I could see clearly a room
-2085549531
with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter
2035063545
plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing
1412738964
peat-fire.  I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.  The
55402435
candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its
843450591
light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean,
-2113453289
like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
978031085

-1923438341
I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing
-574121782
extraordinary.  A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
1758523098
sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.  Two young,
-1491438598
graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
-352697430
the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
-2004382555
bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
455362638
faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one
2104068058
girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
2028113366

-1923438341
A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!  Who were
127013585
they?  They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
-1976667228
table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
-1585880658
cultivation.  I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
217179221
gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.  I cannot call
942824031
them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
1154378371
bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.  A stand
41188788
between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
372935713
they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
-1800223613
books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
2047967825
aid them in the task of translation.  This scene was as silent as if all
-1036287223
the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
206707960
hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
171625877
tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
-1392377518
click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.  When, therefore, a voice
52707707
broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
-1351089481

-1923438341
"Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old Daniel
1292557180
are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which
457759272
he has awakened in terror--listen!"  And in a low voice she read
1215577996
something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an
-1213922353
unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.  Whether it were Greek or
-897816776
German I could not tell.
-1347109146

-1923438341
"That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it."  The
955271722
other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
-1408311129
while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.  At a later
328511664
day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
893081917
line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
-1935467406
sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:--
1205676917

-1923438341
"'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!"
1684636582
she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled.  "There you have a
702850738
dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a
-780632481
hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines
731818299
Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!"
-414540895

-1923438341
Both were again silent.
1187324926

-1923438341
"Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old woman,
-1962423849
looking up from her knitting.
1861337781

-1923438341
"Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
-259039923
other way."
-249526851

-1923438341
"Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
838869974
and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
-583591939

-1923438341
"We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we
-1160231991
are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we
1395228774
cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
-548612518

-1923438341
"And what good does it do you?"
-680126737

-1923438341
"We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say;
-1437606881
and then we shall get more money than we do now."
-607480179

-1923438341
"Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
-547836968

-1923438341
"I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?"
-512160040

-1923438341
"Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no
-1541104419
master but a lexicon."
2023183578

-1923438341
"It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch.
-1369783505
I wonder when St. John will come home."
1495132841

-1923438341
"Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold
1103477772
watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have
2036292928
the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
-351200811

-1923438341
The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
1788659015
soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
-453667731

-1923438341
"Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now:
-1611910950
it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner."
1868306915

-1923438341
She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
1718309400
sad now.
565912769

-1923438341
"But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
138073404
here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
-1599593025

-1923438341
"You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
1949155022

-1923438341
"He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had
78531905
been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when
-679054017
Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair
1979998622
laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the
-882118814
next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver
-2074067497
wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and
1408387100
fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr.
-2118062818
St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your
549394334
mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the
-346584076
pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
-876629657

-1923438341
I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
-1095064110
such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference.  Both were fair
1193716625
complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction
434642065
and intelligence.  One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the
-1772052601
other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's
929964743
pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses
158117254
covered her neck with thick curls.  The clock struck ten.
-430220742

-1923438341
"Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
1051337195
St. John when he comes in."
-1207714199

-1923438341
And she proceeded to prepare the meal.  The ladies rose; they seemed
1652742142
about to withdraw to the parlour.  Till this moment, I had been so intent
-1276916445
on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so
-877470531
keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it
-248492986
recurred to me.  More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from
-346817925
contrast.  And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this
-921198199
house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my
-342276083
wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!  As
1938880493
I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last
754845263
idea to be a mere chimera.  Hannah opened.
1845370827

-1923438341
"What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she surveyed
-2031879471
me by the light of the candle she held.
-1436191968

-1923438341
"May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
1287338988

-1923438341
"You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come
106937892
from?"
1371092094

-1923438341
"I am a stranger."
-481899987

-1923438341
"What is your business here at this hour?"
-1848393978

-1923438341
"I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
1538529109
bread to eat."
-1109582229

-1923438341
Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face.  "I'll
966832892
give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
513546596
in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely."
-1296534306

-1923438341
"Do let me speak to your mistresses."
2019593453

-1923438341
"No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about
976931352
now; it looks very ill."
1661067577

-1923438341
"But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?"
-1175245942

-1923438341
"Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do
2090386007
wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--"
227540674

-1923438341
"A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't
-1095223964
shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!"
1620141578

-1923438341
"I must; the rain is driving in--"
-1857651343

-1923438341
"Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--"
1185076023

-1923438341
"Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
-2064298858
make such a noise.  Move off."
-359906129

-1923438341
"But I must die if I am turned away."
2079398558

-1923438341
"Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about
-437135294
folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any
-199686465
followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them
-1307769613
we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and
310158571
guns."  Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and
-1538196522
bolted it within.
-40210572

-1923438341
This was the climax.  A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true
1715770124
despair--rent and heaved my heart.  Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
-385646700
step could I stir.  I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned--I wrung my
738293558
hands--I wept in utter anguish.  Oh, this spectre of death!  Oh, this
-719812571
last hour, approaching in such horror!  Alas, this isolation--this
-1211961083
banishment from my kind!  Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of
195726149
fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon
1627967656
endeavoured to regain.
1144371172

-1923438341
"I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His
772670634
will in silence."
178696275

-1923438341
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
-1182650616
misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb
-1024250562
and still.
-1000522173

-1923438341
"All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
-1083856671
condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be
-1686258777
if you perished here of want."
-498969090

-1923438341
"Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
638971763
incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.  A form was
-1697643266
near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
-271331095
me from distinguishing.  With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
-1804144284
to the door.
503087049

-1923438341
"Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
-1912981738

-1923438341
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
-213357658

-1923438341
"Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come
611493598
in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
-964404135
folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone
-330187175
yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!"
1344354538

-1923438341
"Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your
-1866959415
duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and
164191594
listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at
1682452463
least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
627556039
house."
1391124484

-1923438341
{Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg}
-1801107388

-1923438341
With difficulty I obeyed him.  Presently I stood within that clean,
-718312206
bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an
971851929
aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.  The two
-1150872009
ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at
-1254622337
me.
1968460902

-1923438341
"St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
-335227941

-1923438341
"I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
-1856778361

-1923438341
"She does look white," said Hannah.
912383185

-1923438341
"As white as clay or death," was responded.  "She will fall: let her
762780377
sit."
-702053155

-1923438341
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.  I still
-237319611
possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
1771949659

-1923438341
"Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she
-593524395
is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
-179062393

-1923438341
"A mere spectre!"
-911444764

-1923438341
"Is she ill, or only famished?"
1271762510

-1923438341
"Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of
1362299684
bread."
-1064114017

-1923438341
Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
471080036
the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
-1048216180
put it to my lips.  Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
1127852381
and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing.  In her simple words, too,
1897359170
the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
-529516189

-1923438341
"Yes--try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
2038795172
bonnet and lifted my head.  I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
-1898340260
first, eagerly soon.
756351247

-1923438341
"Not too much at first--restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
-1598331521
enough."  And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
1398566759

-1923438341
"A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes."
-1438497361

-1923438341
"No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her
659804297
name."
1830105319

-1923438341
I felt I could speak, and I answered--"My name is Jane Elliott."  Anxious
532135770
as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
449735547

-1923438341
"And where do you live?  Where are your friends?"
-571814375

-1923438341
I was silent.
-2012987564

-1923438341
"Can we send for any one you know?"
2104568328

-1923438341
I shook my head.
1730804433

-1923438341
"What account can you give of yourself?"
1428920588

-1923438341
Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
943979234
once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast,
-263438250
vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.  I dared to put off the
-1951441369
mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.  I began once more
1879462005
to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at
-19110809
present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause--
-1161571173

-1923438341
"Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
-1933652320

-1923438341
"But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
1947214077

-1923438341
"Nothing," I replied.  My strength sufficed for but short answers.  Diana
163825334
took the word--
591783139

-1923438341
"Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
-939747286
require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
-1469117183

-1923438341
I looked at her.  She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
-718349460
both with power and goodness.  I took sudden courage.  Answering her
-24369991
compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--"I will trust you.  If I were a
-61887589
masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
1046605126
hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me
-877915726
as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I
-1481743836
feel a spasm when I speak."  All three surveyed me, and all three were
986291993
silent.
1472636203

-1923438341
"Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present, and
44756798
ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that
921623226
milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the
1390083237
matter over."
1872387107

-1923438341
They withdrew.  Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell
-1482239958
which.  A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
-1467451806
genial fire.  In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah.  Ere
-1579580547
long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
281548133
dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.  I
379725839
thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful
4346839
joy--and slept.
-830103119

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXIX
-889637987

-1923438341

-1923438341
The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
-893129656
dim in my mind.  I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
-1397547678
few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.  I knew I was in a small
1730190146
room and in a narrow bed.  To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
915469862
it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
-1933850975
almost to kill me.  I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change
-893970584
from morning to noon, from noon to evening.  I observed when any one
508437536
entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
91209211
understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
-2131999989
not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
1811128009
Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.  Her coming disturbed
1454454673
me.  I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not understand
-946163121
me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.  Diana and
31648422
Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.  They would whisper
-1409242467
sentences of this sort at my bedside--
955082556

-1923438341
"It is very well we took her in."
-845035209

-1923438341
"Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning
2061709434
had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?"
-832273556

-1923438341
"Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?"
860555668

-1923438341
"She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
-1959607960
speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though
79537091
splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
972725621

-1923438341
"She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
-1571200742
it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
-396225629
would be agreeable."
-826613482

-1923438341
Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
1079378580
hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to,
1333216824
myself.  I was comforted.
-375496259

-1923438341
Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
-1661324310
lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
-318247420
fatigue.  He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
1739304861
sure, would manage best, left to herself.  He said every nerve had been
-264046395
overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while.
-1006234351
There was no disease.  He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when
1615614463
once commenced.  These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet,
-1214212281
low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little
498696350
accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
-1076427835
certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
197440589

-1923438341
"Far otherwise," responded Diana.  "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
-125882615
rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit
-1304121313
her permanently."
-1599941092

-1923438341
"That is hardly likely," was the reply.  "You will find she is some young
597977215
lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably
283156694
injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to
101359951
them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face
-1163374873
which make me sceptical of her tractability."  He stood considering me
543220881
some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all handsome."
1170015951

-1923438341
"She is so ill, St. John."
497932387

-1923438341
"Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty
790590327
are quite wanting in those features."
-1426692048

-1923438341
On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
-325842610
in bed, and turn.  Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about,
-903311297
as I supposed, the dinner-hour.  I had eaten with relish: the food was
-718997483
good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had
-579401837
swallowed.  When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived:
85201252
ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.  I wished to
-1368933238
rise; but what could I put on?  Only my damp and bemired apparel; in
1338756293
which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.  I felt ashamed
1032302238
to appear before my benefactors so clad.  I was spared the humiliation.
-271100489

-1923438341
On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.  My
-930197344
black silk frock hung against the wall.  The traces of the bog were
-994283894
removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
-1595075508
decent.  My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
910635617
presentable.  There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and
1872033144
brush to smooth my hair.  After a weary process, and resting every five
-1228737001
minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself.  My clothes hung loose on me;
787043168
for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once
242906845
more, clean and respectable looking--no speck of the dirt, no trace of
-968185845
the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left--I crept
325104605
down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low
-1501261066
passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
559383534

-1923438341
It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
903417712
fire.  Hannah was baking.  Prejudices, it is well known, are most
-199793996
difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened
762771515
or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
-1442671226
Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she had
705827284
begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in tidy and
-485422909
well-dressed, she even smiled.
-1236275017

-1923438341
"What, you have got up!" she said.  "You are better, then.  You may sit
-1848423173
you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
-1856286206

-1923438341
She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it.  She bustled about,
-1916230571
examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye.  Turning to
-365248569
me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly--
1513691809

-1923438341
"Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
-1425045202

-1923438341
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
-181933503
question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
-668512761
quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
49784263

-1923438341
"You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more
-303773621
than yourself or your young ladies."
106869682

-1923438341
After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no house,
198215971
nor no brass, I guess?"
2088448952

-1923438341
"The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not
-760723742
make a beggar in your sense of the word."
-1224040842

-1923438341
"Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
1975403339

-1923438341
"Yes, very."
281221035

-1923438341
"But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
1645833491

-1923438341
"I was at a boarding-school eight years."
1639366933

-1923438341
She opened her eyes wide.  "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
-1065526802

-1923438341
"I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you
1729454612
going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought out a
-786513668
basket of the fruit.
1128334924

-1923438341
"Mak' 'em into pies."
1281585469

-1923438341
"Give them to me and I'll pick them."
-1553590023

-1923438341
"Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
601325195

-1923438341
"But I must do something.  Let me have them."
-214613243

-1923438341
She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
1745553023
dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
1512658577

-1923438341
"Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
1468801634
remarked.  "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
-520073729

-1923438341
"No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
-1540959769
your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
-613158706
are."
-1750512771

-1923438341
"Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
-1075409481

-1923438341
"And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
1004156827

-1923438341
"Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at
789281723
home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
-1198410704

-1923438341
"That village a few miles off?
610523968

-1923438341
"Aye."
206285475

-1923438341
"And what is he?"
-1990337959

-1923438341
"He is a parson."
-908317566

-1923438341
I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
-1303375381
had asked to see the clergyman.  "This, then, was his father's
-1204044568
residence?"
-855765698

-1923438341
"Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
1205363394
gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
1659620765

-1923438341
"The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
-268623823

-1923438341
"Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
1157410132

-1923438341
"And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
-358575077

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Their father is dead?"
1987129965

-1923438341
"Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
8250703

-1923438341
"They have no mother?"
252750755

-1923438341
"The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
1972336768

-1923438341
"Have you lived with the family long?"
-1712880050

-1923438341
"I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three."
429694874

-1923438341
"That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will
380736143
say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
-1414124581
beggar."
-1352636071

-1923438341
She again regarded me with a surprised stare.  "I believe," she said, "I
-740162586
was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
-552240708
goes about, you mun forgie me."
1430813232

-1923438341
"And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
1419761900
the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
1749943544

-1923438341
"Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th'
970512382
childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on
-1752335095
'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish."
1376805676

-1923438341
I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
313420956

-1923438341
"You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
833525532

-1923438341
"But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why--not so
-2091814810
much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
1894307101
impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
-765287759
had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived
-398760284
have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not
1683277170
to consider poverty a crime."
160677144

-1923438341
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
-757247333
wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
-548673377
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
-1294709638

-1923438341
"That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands."
1862928923

-1923438341
She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
-1360490950
illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
412351710

-1923438341
Hannah was evidently fond of talking.  While I picked the fruit, and she
482455678
made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
-123646410
about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called
1411579081
the young people.
-1788231692

-1923438341
Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of
1507030070
as ancient a family as could be found.  Marsh End had belonged to the
-254445866
Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
-558116747
hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
-1470384209
compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could
1398112513
remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
178860581
wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking
-1360535978
into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry."  Still, she allowed, "the
1445318376
owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark
-214808685
mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like."  The mistress was
689575242
different.  She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns"
-390254909
had taken after her.  There was nothing like them in these parts, nor
-997286426
ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time
1164409132
they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own."  Mr.
1575603277
St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the
-423550021
girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for
-639623004
they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of
-247568581
money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not
1634453747
rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.  They
262396596
had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to
336088076
stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like
1148244000
Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.  They had been
273068418
in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no
1219424374
place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never
45756447
fell out nor "threaped."  She did not know where there was such a family
1446780219
for being united.
-1454878365

-1923438341
Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
1847757582
ladies and their brother were now.
-2082254479

-1923438341
"Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
971030489
to tea."
-803675271

-1923438341
They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
1877773674
the kitchen door.  Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
-314280526
through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly
1548040655
expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be able to
1769704435
come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
1267727525

-1923438341
"You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said.  "You still
-7652096
look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!"
709678875

-1923438341
Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.  She
1108978065
possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter.  Her whole face
1554341876
seemed to me full of charm.  Mary's countenance was equally
-598047024
intelligent--her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
-11739241
reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant.  Diana looked and
1339770664
spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently.  It was my
-1313484372
nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers,
-1430073998
and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active
2012134670
will.
1708789768

-1923438341
"And what business have you here?" she continued.  "It is not your place.
-2652319
Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be
-717052008
free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the
-1625484075
parlour."
-366393197

-1923438341
"I am very well here."
1373122052

-1923438341
"Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
-57272243

-1923438341
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
465334916

-1923438341
"To be sure," added her sister.  "Come, you must be obedient."  And still
-146294506
holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
894427958

-1923438341
"Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our things
1006487182
off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our
-848225313
little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined,
-1422763337
or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
1946533698

-1923438341
She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
999899287
opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand.  I examined first, the
-445565239
parlour, and then its occupant.
1880865132

-1923438341
The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
124006043
comfortable, because clean and neat.  The old-fashioned chairs were very
-549524120
bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass.  A few
1216813073
strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
2058288797
the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
-100356193
an ancient set of china.  There was no superfluous ornament in the
-2115968616
room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
976000306
lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
616848125
everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn
1116621625
and well saved.
2018472912

-1923438341
Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls,
1618902319
keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely
1420679138
sealed--was easy enough to examine.  Had he been a statue instead of a
1229173435
man, he could not have been easier.  He was young--perhaps from twenty-
1166274936
eight to thirty--tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a
-1699807995
Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite
1574580040
an Athenian mouth and chin.  It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes
457317478
so near the antique models as did his.  He might well be a little shocked
-1442607854
at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.  His
-1111019844
eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead,
283267604
colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of
-976602247
fair hair.
-241068251

-1923438341
This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?  Yet he whom it
912710538
describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
1092353884
an impressible, or even of a placid nature.  Quiescent as he now sat,
692315669
there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to my
-1580577796
perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
924231290
eager.  He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
-1370444794
glance, till his sisters returned.  Diana, as she passed in and out, in
-1975005367
the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
994803138
of the oven.
-522249830

-1923438341
"Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had
759330072
nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
-1766678800

-1923438341
I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.  Mr. Rivers
-913953901
now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed
1411444868
his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.  There was an unceremonious
-1250834852
directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his gaze now, which
436408871
told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted
-1916993109
from the stranger.
1329989935

-1923438341
"You are very hungry," he said.
1063906119

-1923438341
"I am, sir."  It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to
-450407958
meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
1545316998

-1923438341
"It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
-414257185
last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings
-1161593955
of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not
-1733593808
immoderately."
429269834

-1923438341
"I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very clumsily-
923409297
contrived, unpolished answer.
729722737

-1923438341
"No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
-1754839292
your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
-561953626

-1923438341
"That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
-1191840066
absolutely without home and friends."
1954164566

-1923438341
The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
606656644
suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.  I speak
944971357
particularly of the young ladies.  St. John's eyes, though clear enough
-1192720363
in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.  He
-1256686983
seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
335331559
thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
977010656
keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
577260382
to encourage.
866556615

-1923438341
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
1894619540
every connection?"
-631602180

-1923438341
"I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
-736195538
to admittance under any roof in England."
861992334

-1923438341
"A most singular position at your age!"
647666144

-1923438341
Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
536109260
table before me.  I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
1567253717
explained the quest.
-442266109

-1923438341
"You have never been married?  You are a spinster?"
-1410352266

-1923438341
Diana laughed.  "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old,
1218449370
St. John," said she.
-1829986582

-1923438341
"I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No."
-650596487

-1923438341
I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
733994350
recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.  They all saw
-2110910291
the embarrassment and the emotion.  Diana and Mary relieved me by turning
503744334
their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and
-1881290849
sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had excited forced
-372943845
out tears as well as colour.
1822684933

-1923438341
"Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
559314836

-1923438341
"You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but he
-1576357616
leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
-1082583422
piercing look.
70734801

-1923438341
"The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my
-654066922
secret," I replied concisely.
1088900819

-1923438341
"Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from
-1326255260
St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
-475712239

-1923438341
"Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you," he
-493573683
said.  "And you need help, do you not?"
-948993849

-1923438341
"I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will
-874343754
put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration
1045636152
for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life."
85156433

-1923438341
"I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
-1375953728
you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell
-794604330
me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
-1657422443

-1923438341
I had now swallowed my tea.  I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as
2010111923
much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and
-823331010
enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
-309223772

-1923438341
"Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked at
1290453060
me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done me a
-750585818
great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued
-210364086
me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives
1535766679
you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent,
749618479
on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer
2131544253
you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of
-652749729
mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
1092607998

-1923438341
"I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I
1508464013
could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable
-177281373
institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I
774505891
passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum,
-1740436903
---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert
1375938613
Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
-2065421631

-1923438341
"I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
-190319138

-1923438341
"I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I
2060067169
obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to
998206542
leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot
-319547340
and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound
-503964154
incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as
528266108
any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the
627766959
catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a
-1963016820
strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my
935926196
departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me
1659017316
everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and
381719233
trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to
358540053
Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I
309730866
slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without
2136390845
crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food;
1383151133
and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the
-1424548403
last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your
1469815308
door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your
600349767
sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my
880454936
seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial
-2070441633
compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity."
1317636724

-1923438341
"Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
318429444
"she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit
1027766213
down now, Miss Elliott."
-949851957

-1923438341
I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had forgotten
-1849431780
my new name.  Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at
1776903575
once.
-1358466930

-1923438341
"You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
1566444393

-1923438341
"I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
-11981065
called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
-1375353713
sounds strange to me."
582040230

-1923438341
"Your real name you will not give?"
-153153315

-1923438341
"No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
1997429029
lead to it, I avoid."
1577480997

-1923438341
"You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana.  "Now do, brother, let her
1001446205
be at peace a while."
1213102495

-1923438341
But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as imperturbably
604526645
and with as much acumen as ever.
-1138297521

-1923438341
"You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would
1694801498
wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
1252021930
and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction
467993458
drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of
388074330
us?"
-469200601

-1923438341
"I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work:
-1438651375
that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest
-654588653
cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of
-23129312
the horrors of homeless destitution."
-1371646849

-1923438341
"Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on my
624190985
head.  "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
-956491266
sincerity which seemed natural to her.
-859083770

-1923438341
"My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St. John,
1838722575
"as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen
769921498
bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel
-1583789592
more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall
-370092475
endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the
-719027855
incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
-385205025
And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some
-1160475273
more efficient succour than such as I can offer."
-795816185

-1923438341
"She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can
2082387156
do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no choice of
582202486
helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you."
1764211394

-1923438341
"I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
577987413
servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
1594351464

-1923438341
"Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly.  "If such is your spirit, I
-10897686
promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
216447315

-1923438341
He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea.  I
-804586750
soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
1066798078
present strength would permit.
-119193913

-1923438341

CHAPTER XXX
9906129

-1923438341

-1923438341
The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.  In
1076675851
a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day,
868660010
and walk out sometimes.  I could join with Diana and Mary in all their
-1171897382
occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when
511193399
and where they would allow me.  There was a reviving pleasure in this
1352032724
intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure
1238290083
arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
1043594644

-1923438341
I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me;
-2037169292
what they approved, I reverenced.  They loved their sequestered home.  I,
-2009615193
too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its
-1577301830
latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all
-13565896
grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden, dark with
-1575438060
yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would
-922069366
bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.  They clung to the purple
1810365134
moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the
1383598288
pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound
-1255512370
between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little
1874762603
pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave
1643011679
sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-
613880364
faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm
1090478531
of attachment.  I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
1561610266
strength and truth.  I saw the fascination of the locality.  I felt the
-2016875359
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
-1804128427
and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss,
-1617668244
by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow
-1282113010
granite crag.  These details were just to me what they were to them--so
94302991
many pure and sweet sources of pleasure.  The strong blast and the soft
652677515
breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset;
-1770061014
the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions,
-1551625183
the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell
634127610
that entranced theirs.
-1911497391

-1923438341
Indoors we agreed equally well.  They were both more accomplished and
-1746680337
better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
-509283554
knowledge they had trodden before me.  I devoured the books they lent me:
1108533496
then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I
-904667374
had perused during the day.  Thought fitted thought; opinion met opinion:
-543731692
we coincided, in short, perfectly.
-448120078

-1923438341
If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
-496904339
Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous.  In
409246807
her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow,
1181730115
such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.  I could
-1818351220
talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity
-477167279
and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest
148846382
my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and Mary, while they
653597499
sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.  Diana offered
-2134582680
to teach me German.  I liked to learn of her: I saw the part of
-227012730
instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar pleased and suited
-1655243541
me no less.  Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest
-1712525987
kind--was the result.  They discovered I could draw: their pencils and
-577341901
colour-boxes were immediately at my service.  My skill, greater in this
1772502362
one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them.  Mary would sit and
715227763
watch me by the hour together: then she would take lessons; and a docile,
-946445939
intelligent, assiduous pupil she made.  Thus occupied, and mutually
-1320177489
entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
1575607455

-1923438341
As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly
760580475
between me and his sisters did not extend to him.  One reason of the
1013377464
distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively seldom at
1779335983
home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to visiting the
416509102
sick and poor among the scattered population of his parish.
-1798442741

-1923438341
No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
-2115203068
fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his hat,
-1980003777
and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his mission
-898793670
of love or duty--I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
-908839361
Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
-1677878513
expostulate.  He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
2041319757
cheerful--
1429224046

-1923438341
"And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
550599825
these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
-1543547458
propose to myself?"
1919307499

-1923438341
Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
-834422014
minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
-1376644382

-1923438341
But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
1200770880
friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of
-1705807962
a brooding nature.  Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in his
-9988275
life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity,
155064216
that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere
-648808000
Christian and practical philanthropist.  Often, of an evening, when he
815211006
sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would cease reading
-724732997
or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver himself up to I know
-1414099966
not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might
1843193239
be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his eye.
1911931512

-1923438341
I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight it
-1118939638
was to his sisters.  He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
65374961
strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
-1191887193
for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was more
-157692524
of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was
1211752079
manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for the sake of their
-636085208
soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful
-303410032
delights they could yield.
386081425

-1923438341
Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity
-1789311649
of gauging his mind.  I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him
-281694802
preach in his own church at Morton.  I wish I could describe that sermon:
-348575392
but it is past my power.  I cannot even render faithfully the effect it
1833173391
produced on me.
2116289663

-1923438341
It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it
211542657
was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
26229134
breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
-2084536602
This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled.  The heart was
-536766114
thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were
-1934464732
softened.  Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of
-1465457571
consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
-815006714
doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each
-236798194
reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
-1246569552
When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by
-983836948
his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to
1831270565
me--I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which
724839529
I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of
-1614428502
disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and
1692586141
disquieting aspirations.  I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived,
892481388
conscientious, zealous as he was--had not yet found that peace of God
-2040583136
which passeth all understanding: he had no more found it, I thought, than
1093203102
had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost
-1171746221
elysium--regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which
-88270045
possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
-217066119

-1923438341
Meantime a month was gone.  Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House,
841720898
and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as
-1595870472
governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each
-1612996149
held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they
-1727015360
were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought
1378971546
out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired
-93979588
accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste
-547482359
of their waiting-woman.  Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about
574586406
the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent
-1543129298
that I should have a vocation of some kind.  One morning, being left
-875174367
alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the
1370656887
window-recess--which his table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of
372867447
study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what
1101721150
words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the
2006850135
ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his--when he saved me the
-648936147
trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
-269044239

-1923438341
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
-1752132879

-1923438341
"Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
988603035
myself to undertake?"
257501126

-1923438341
"I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed
-1106923523
both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached
1502335242
to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it
1593375844
inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching
-1186161408
departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
711160745

-1923438341
"And they will go in three days now?" I said.
-1671039641

-1923438341
"Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah
1842716743
will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
157095701

-1923438341
I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
-1099773632
broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his
1805560265
look denoted abstraction from me and my business.  I was obliged to
1150136685
recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
1282608583
interest to me.
69326120

-1923438341
"What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay
-933289038
will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
-1701828066

-1923438341
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and
1316189497
you to accept."
414610916

-1923438341
He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue.  I grew
735255088
impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
-172522290
fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as words
-345386997
could have done, and with less trouble.
107666434

-1923438341
"You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
-1056550252
have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain,
-618917218
recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it
-1736658633
must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find
-1574425100
that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to
1373174185
me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the
1865650721
patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I
1166382378
am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of
-148899658
the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third
924299163
considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life,
1895326571
but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by
1822781525
the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from
-1477242615
fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that
-1603009041
church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word,
-676278733
'Rise, follow Me!'"
1849465680

-1923438341
St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
1574888127
deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
-1337148886
glance.  He resumed--
-1738822816

-1923438341
"And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of
1584622786
poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now
1558836220
your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to
361156196
the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but
453763228
_I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold
1067237506
that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian
544554665
labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his
-1667599764
toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is
1110756596
the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the
-1918665692
Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself."
-727060510

-1923438341
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
-582095579

-1923438341
He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to read
293311181
my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.  The
-894197030
conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
-1870614546
succeeding observations.
-1742370212

-1923438341
"I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
-604826697
for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
-1968831362
keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English
-606918386
country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
-542742814
repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
1458860356

-1923438341
"Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
-956793814

-1923438341
"I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how
1056835287
cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
-1548198640
and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the
-692638361
course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the
485403067
utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had
1348011898
no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of
-195799744
progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school
2017578973
for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of
-1464734222
two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be
-805768364
thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but
-2079419829
sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter
-1076570202
of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle-
-489735063
factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the
-341042959
education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that
1988736081
she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own
-843663033
house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her
-788271040
having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?"
-389910557

-1923438341
He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
979028605
indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
-1283808265
all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell in
478049829
what light the lot would appear to me.  In truth it was humble--but then
343375019
it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding--but then,
-436308270
compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent;
-1229435566
and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it
2125782476
was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my
-1359705402
decision.
-1794786103

-1923438341
"I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
1051112964
heart."
3118985

-1923438341
"But you comprehend me?" he said.  "It is a village school: your scholars
462249014
will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers'
358985683
daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all
-2073979212
you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments?
-2075601070
What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?"
-1076145977

-1923438341
"Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep."
-1322561008

-1923438341
"You know what you undertake, then?"
1934939722

-1923438341
"I do."
-1848289778

-1923438341
He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and
1678949899
deeply gratified.
-891429992

-1923438341
"And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
948660375

-1923438341
"I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next
461618501
week."
-615558771

-1923438341
"Very well: so be it."
-2086834218

-1923438341
He rose and walked through the room.  Standing still, he again looked at
930338068
me.  He shook his head.
-598935503

-1923438341
"What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
1493934740

-1923438341
"You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
-1167315303

-1923438341
"Why?  What is your reason for saying so?"
1683104458

-1923438341
"I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the
-1599839672
maintenance of an even tenor in life."
299419439

-1923438341
"I am not ambitious."
1604586804

-1923438341
He started at the word "ambitious."  He repeated, "No.  What made you
-507082761
think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find
-1435648930
it out?"
-1955109100

-1923438341
"I was speaking of myself."
-2075653401

-1923438341
"Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--"  He paused.
1623146154

-1923438341
"What?"
353384197

-1923438341
"I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
-1532433628
misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human
-335073302
affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure
534948393
you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
1417216371
devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus:
606352782
any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to live here
1802035102
buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me,
1092400661
contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You
-1162754037
hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a
1396884849
humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers
-1466084591
of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my
466027528
restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by
-188582996
some means."
-383893829

-1923438341
He left the room.  In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
797750202
the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
-1953580720

-1923438341
Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
-813982886
for leaving their brother and their home.  They both tried to appear as
1345983329
usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not
-1444459525
be entirely conquered or concealed.  Diana intimated that this would be a
-172528171
different parting from any they had ever yet known.  It would probably,
-801754792
as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a
-1495240301
parting for life.
1531002215

-1923438341
"He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
-1191643613
affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane;
1858850708
but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in
-1641775725
some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
1954742315
conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
1432929386
decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is
-2005927349
right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!"  And the tears gushed
-928828300
to her fine eyes.  Mary bent her head low over her work.
-203465092

-1923438341
"We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
-109585079
she murmured.
421589542

-1923438341
At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate
-871309423
purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never come
1590702921
singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
1300312161
between the cup and the lip.  St. John passed the window reading a
-968013360
letter.  He entered.
648319247

-1923438341
"Our uncle John is dead," said he.
-300098595

-1923438341
Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
684727397
appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
1155185916

-1923438341
"Dead?" repeated Diana.
1547068519

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face.  "And what then?" she
1442957950
demanded, in a low voice.
-1999374711

-1923438341
"What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature.
-1182917
"What then?  Why--nothing.  Read."
-833551324

-1923438341
He threw the letter into her lap.  She glanced over it, and handed it to
276118141
Mary.  Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother.  All
1842382182
three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile
-1068705610
enough.
-1642386057

-1923438341
"Amen!  We can yet live," said Diana at last.
-118969101

-1923438341
"At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
1989812674
Mary.
2023102154

-1923438341
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
-2110951195
have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with
1283687709
what _is_."
459067851

-1923438341
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
-1708356776

-1923438341
For some minutes no one spoke.  Diana then turned to me.
1984359403

-1923438341
"Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think us
-945810409
hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
1390904823
relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my
-2109883854
mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his
-568980113
advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that
1105730240
ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in
-832360479
anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more
-140447205
prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty
-1840423026
thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but
-84093075
ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My
-250444291
father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by
-206139623
leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has
-1137083546
bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of
837601692
thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers,
1930626005
for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to
522906371
do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the
-1823872394
receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with
1941636943
a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been
-1402438541
valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do."
-1906779667

-1923438341
This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference
1377813771
made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters.  The next day I left
373533826
Marsh End for Morton.  The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for
-435213574
distant B-.  In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage:
151923598
and so the old grange was abandoned.
-1393787955

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXXI
877969512

-1923438341

-1923438341
My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room
-718559380
with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs
-1455465541
and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes,
-1706111618
and a set of tea-things in delf.  Above, a chamber of the same dimensions
236657286
as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too
1632829035
large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my
966241391
gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such
688302726
things as are necessary.
-1347157920

-1923438341
It is evening.  I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little
-1883659067
orphan who serves me as a handmaid.  I am sitting alone on the hearth.
-1117069516
This morning, the village school opened.  I had twenty scholars.  But
2107568010
three of the number can read: none write or cipher.  Several knit, and a
1345762438
few sew a little.  They speak with the broadest accent of the district.
1962383515
At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's
1970828491
language.  Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as
1064158930
ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a
-616250991
disposition that pleases me.  I must not forget that these coarsely-clad
-964996913
little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest
-535789572
genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement,
-878965963
intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in
-1346219788
those of the best-born.  My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I
720147212
shall find some happiness in discharging that office.  Much enjoyment I
-744490004
do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I
1388676732
regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live
1955493124
on from day to day.
1894008480

-1923438341
Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder
1957192128
bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?  Not to deceive
514883700
myself, I must reply--No: I felt desolate to a degree.  I felt--yes,
-125570401
idiot that I am--I felt degraded.  I doubted I had taken a step which
1759094968
sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.  I was
1360092822
weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I
1216379058
heard and saw round me.  But let me not hate and despise myself too much
-1969478222
for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained;
-1712024752
I shall strive to overcome them.  To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the
-1612352012
better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite
748259478
subdued.  In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing
-59596579
progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute
-859978099
gratification for disgust.
115609094

-1923438341
Meantime, let me ask myself one question--Which is better?--To have
-1547190558
surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no
-1314008332
struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on
890062560
the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the
-1911268824
luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr.
-1192621360
Rochester's mistress; delirious with his love half my time--for he
-461181915
would--oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while.  He _did_ love
-2067040213
me--no one will ever love me so again.  I shall never more know the sweet
1483424792
homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall
-2048605459
I seem to possess these charms.  He was fond and proud of me--it is what
-1215396943
no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I
-1102168934
saying, and above all, feeling?  Whether is it better, I ask, to be a
1791606891
slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one
-1010858056
hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the
-1046273051
next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy
898100723
mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
-92437465

-1923438341
Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and
-2088875862
scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.  God
1930620068
directed me to a correct choice: I thank His providence for the guidance!
64189587

-1923438341
Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my
232044892
door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet
-1571778583
fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile
-671346244
from the village.  The birds were singing their last strains--
596890525

-1923438341
   "The air was mild, the dew was balm."
563462195

-1923438341
While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself
2021874836
ere long weeping--and why?  For the doom which had reft me from adhesion
440683412
to my master: for him I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and
-302077503
fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be
-988988123
dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate
1136705173
restoration thither.  At this thought, I turned my face aside from the
81128732
lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say _lonely_, for in that
-2137297325
bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church
-936967870
and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the
-1161966307
roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his daughter lived.  I
781046603
hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but
2004535305
soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the
1143281377
meadow beyond it made me look up.  A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer,
-79610175
as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his nose, and St. John
1214253276
himself leant upon it with folded arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave
212132390
almost to displeasure, fixed on me.  I asked him to come in.
2021944055

-1923438341
"No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters
-2080222031
left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper."
-430459918

-1923438341
I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was.  He examined my face, I
1703233806
thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were
1184686931
doubtless very visible upon it.
1366711375

-1923438341
"Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?" he
-138166369
asked.
-2088707533

-1923438341
"Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my
-463696901
scholars very well."
324595002

-1923438341
"But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have
1867079913
disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--"
240999221
I interrupted--
-413866701

-1923438341
"My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and
437604047
commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not
486797153
absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a
536549778
carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I
1566408851
was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a
738489965
business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends;
-90128321
the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine."
-595904509

-1923438341
"But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you
211675126
is dark and empty."
-797770395

-1923438341
"I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less
-379697308
to grow impatient under one of loneliness."
1628969349

-1923438341
"Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your
-2061478776
good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the
-1000313521
vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of
341842098
course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation
1287724924
which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career
-112237789
steadily, for some months at least."
372587462

-1923438341
"It is what I mean to do," I answered.  St. John continued--
-1254604840

-1923438341
"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent
-882172387
of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has
-777813859
given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our
809228730
energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will
-969610673
strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from
-1928870959
inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another
1098030717
nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to
-1007758640
taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road
-1482750924
as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if
-1722676713
rougher than it.
1856342536

-1923438341
"A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had
806549317
made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to
-1516620297
death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more
1958501968
exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist,
-1007081682
author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of
1566633535
a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a
1364417501
luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my
-100400450
life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season
-618802165
of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped
-1526782168
existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers
1462137694
heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread
-215261315
their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear
-1098572487
which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and
1937496145
eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,
1581988477
were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
1733063964

-1923438341
"A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind
1696693592
changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving
2129482317
nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My
1854159193
father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have
1775147689
not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a
1006916532
successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings
-1186703944
broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in
1783748281
which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_
2068740649
overcome--and I leave Europe for the East."
78625375

-1923438341
He said this, in his peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when
355333389
he had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I
1824632904
looked too.  Both he and I had our backs towards the path leading up the
-1408102072
field to the wicket.  We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the
795904157
water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and
-555569896
scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell,
-1321359265
exclaimed--
1427537273

-1923438341
"Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is
-434069541
quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears
-658232739
and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have
-1074040524
your back towards me now."
-889282673

-1923438341
It was true.  Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical
-1912176609
accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his head, he stood
-91657069
yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the
-126310034
speaker had surprised him--his arm resting on the gate, his face directed
-946688122
towards the west.  He turned at last, with measured deliberation.  A
-1893587001
vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.  There appeared,
170988448
within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful
1294241886
form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo,
-322612577
it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under
1615051893
his glance a face of perfect beauty.  Perfect beauty is a strong
1917225954
expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever
-93277885
the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as
-797061838
ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified,
-417926184
in this instance, the term.  No charm was wanting, no defect was
-30756297
perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes
1708130504
shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark,
2113318714
and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so
421374684
soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the
1955559022
white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of
1620815888
tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too,
1077384196
ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw;
670321153
the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all
1516176331
advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were
338764267
fully hers.  I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her
-2031190006
with my whole heart.  Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood;
-2035397163
and, forgetting her usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed
-472456306
this, her darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
1693463119

-1923438341
What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?  I naturally asked
1859962267
myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as
731000227
naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance.  He had
851506759
already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft
1319200411
of daisies which grew by the wicket.
1604948443

-1923438341
"A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone," he said, as he
-93263866
crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.
-544889091

-1923438341
"Oh, I only came home from S-" (she mentioned the name of a large town
870283606
some twenty miles distant) "this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened
1769259178
your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my
-1360155076
bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?"
254139427
pointing to me.
1714564904

-1923438341
"It is," said St. John.
230720244

-1923438341
"Do you think you shall like Morton?" she asked of me, with a direct and
-1508486285
naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.
1665541291

-1923438341
"I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so."
-1463483278

-1923438341
"Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?"
-1502522721

-1923438341
"Quite."
1785556170

-1923438341
"Do you like your house?"
1242981891

-1923438341
"Very much."
-1492018846

-1923438341
"Have I furnished it nicely?"
-1084139446

-1923438341
"Very nicely, indeed."
353155819

-1923438341
"And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?"
616295197

-1923438341
"You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy."  (This then, I thought,
-353693253
is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune,
-719255592
as well as in those of nature!  What happy combination of the planets
773408071
presided over her birth, I wonder?)
-1181845670

-1923438341
"I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes," she added.  "It will
-632237337
be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr.
20246734
Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather
-1176902255
this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are
2043169951
stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable
-1630790474
men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor
548552793
merchants to shame."
-1387573494

-1923438341
It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his upper
-981405365
lip curled a moment.  His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,
1066182463
and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the
1968170032
laughing girl gave him this information.  He lifted his gaze, too, from
-43855695
the daisies, and turned it on her.  An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning
375375117
gaze it was.  She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well
-1298337885
became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.
-303998559

-1923438341
As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo.  "Poor
1771218885
Carlo loves me," said she.  "_He_ is not stern and distant to his
-953528395
friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent."
-1451078109

-1923438341
As she patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his young
1104950467
and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.  I saw his
613847687
solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion.
145831641
Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she
147184891
for a woman.  His chest heaved once, as if his large heart, weary of
354599676
despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a
1730474079
vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.  But he curbed it, I think,
816298137
as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed.  He responded neither by
-1018609468
word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.
-31654368

-1923438341
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking
-937482714
up.  "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening,
1187106682
and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?"
-736930875

-1923438341
"It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver," answered St.
1834244591
John.
-498167801

-1923438341
"Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when
333042437
papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business
1192610530
to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and
2140229052
so very sombre?"  She filled up the hiatus his silence left by a reply of
-557680531
her own.
1281635531

-1923438341
"I forgot!" she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if
-595629650
shocked at herself.  "I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It
-142316710
had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for
-1138916111
joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is
809268678
shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see
773651526
papa."
241071108

-1923438341
"Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night."
-947521412

-1923438341
Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort
1928436566
it cost him thus to refuse.
27871031

-1923438341
"Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any
22840115
longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!"
-2124441431

-1923438341
She held out her hand.  He just touched it.  "Good evening!" he repeated,
-1124817741
in a voice low and hollow as an echo.  She turned, but in a moment
-1389548747
returned.
-782942443

-1923438341
"Are you well?" she asked.  Well might she put the question: his face was
343309822
blanched as her gown.
-386252453

-1923438341
"Quite well," he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate.  She went
-1623826661
one way; he another.  She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped
365378850
fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned
512277670
at all.
18916838

-1923438341
This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from
-1519014508
exclusive meditation on my own.  Diana Rivers had designated her brother
-707730207
"inexorable as death."  She had not exaggerated.

CHAPTER XXXII
-1487281669

-1923438341

-1923438341
I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully
-676491807
as I could.  It was truly hard work at first.  Some time elapsed before,
-297058712
with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
-1256973386
Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me
-289597549
hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I
761671431
was mistaken.  There was a difference amongst them as amongst the
1326994239
educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
-281131994
rapidly developed itself.  Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
673373345
and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
-999154660
rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.  Many showed themselves
774719207
obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
1085337832
examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
403984814
excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.  These
-402888703
soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
1847820161
neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
-588295719
manners.  The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
-1654962570
surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began
297031802
personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.  I had
512709490
amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
-1716997995
almost.  These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
819252015
the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
-1838717981
needlework.  I found estimable characters amongst them--characters
-1924949397
desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed
1679019192
many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.  Their parents then (the
818968318
farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions.  There was an enjoyment
-437329054
in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
-873254696
consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were
-1880185988
not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
1229373765
benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
-65374778
made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
816854758

-1923438341
I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood.  Whenever I went out, I
516587231
heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly
1258518012
smiles.  To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of
211984187
working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;" serene
-525945393
inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.  At this period of my life,
-494789284
my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection:
1858057889
and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful
1553689623
existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars,
326624619
an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush
264606513
into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the
15772508
ideal, the stirring, the stormy--dreams where, amidst unusual scenes,
1567401362
charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still
-267907416
again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and
986094668
then the sense of being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye,
1703620921
touching his hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him--the hope of
-933335511
passing a lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first
69319469
force and fire.  Then I awoke.  Then I recalled where I was, and how
-283008194
situated.  Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering;
1111312851
and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and
-340521295
heard the burst of passion.  By nine o'clock the next morning I was
951155853
punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady
-474035577
duties of the day.
2019899735

-1923438341
Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.  Her call at the
-109287459
school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.  She would
580543262
canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.
-22052762
Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with
-1510503678
her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls
388734957
that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be
-1197625549
imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide
1923319347
through the dazzled ranks of the village children.  She generally came at
-2115825112
the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising
835996221
lesson.  Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young
-1267365093
pastor's heart.  A sort of instinct seemed to warn him of her entrance,
-1893959321
even when he did not see it; and when he was looking quite away from the
-467354074
door, if she appeared at it, his cheek would glow, and his marble-seeming
-2051811194
features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in
644034270
their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger
-1233752708
than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
-724162389

-1923438341
Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could not,
-63169345
conceal it from her.  In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she went
662016235
up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his
-1565172224
face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn.  He seemed to say, with
1607072854
his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I love
-1320715968
you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps
171833322
me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that
1202240927
heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it.
-435823753
It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
1496072011

-1923438341
And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would
404099344
soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily from
-913139834
his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so heroic
-1383905817
and so martyr-like.  St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to
-1627535048
follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he would not give
-1880128661
one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her love, one
-552311528
hope of the true, eternal Paradise.  Besides, he could not bind all that
-933412896
he had in his nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in
1592492681
the limits of a single passion.  He could not--he would not--renounce his
-1565191858
wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale
-837508004
Hall.  I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his
-1093341892
reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
1335493659

-1923438341
Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage.  I
280675959
had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
374935677
she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
-405893471
selfish.  She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
-943024752
spoilt.  She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
1568947627
when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
1068822025
but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
-1176769080
ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she was
-1586752854
very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex like me;
-1293040784
but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.  A very
-858361411
different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters
-505486365
of St. John.  Still, I liked her almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except
-322267435
that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer
-239279211
affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult
-1523107465
acquaintance.
-978760965

-1923438341
She had taken an amiable caprice to me.  She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
648802714
only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a
347531054
nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel."  I was, however,
-508172629
good, clever, composed, and firm, like him.  I was a _lusus naturae_, she
-2103443778
affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous history,
-1750395906
if known, would make a delightful romance.
976900244

-1923438341
One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
1719298767
yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and the
-1043533540
table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French books,
239093349
a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my
-1911167443
drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty
1346069160
little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from
146073205
nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.  She
-1549492456
was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
-1273524574

-1923438341
"Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a
325794301
love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first
1228287069
school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
-1639499790

-1923438341
"With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the
-73893572
idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.  She had then on a
-217582244
dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only ornament
-1270582975
was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with all the
2113047096
wild grace of natural curls.  I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew
-2140175116
a careful outline.  I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and,
-1320711866
as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit another
1741355164
day.
278585554

-1923438341
She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
-1101891547
accompanied her next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
-421407737
grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
-559909410
flower near a hoary turret.  He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
-926073797
personage; but he was very kind to me.  The sketch of Rosamond's portrait
1762548898
pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of it.  He
-239820399
insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale
-517020030
Hall.
1911481735

-1923438341
I went.  I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
-1570181654
evidences of wealth in the proprietor.  Rosamond was full of glee and
-199413478
pleasure all the time I stayed.  Her father was affable; and when he
-920084854
entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong terms
-638820721
his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he only
883474466
feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and
2126139250
would soon quit it for one more suitable.
-1040797356

-1923438341
"Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
-164556195
high family, papa."
-1810488132

-1923438341
I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the
812349722
land.  Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great
-757243555
respect.  He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the
2038173797
ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to
1901638828
them; that even now he considered the representative of that house might,
-1183484732
if he liked, make an alliance with the best.  He accounted it a pity that
714695768
so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going
-230414949
out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.  It
-1845760359
appeared, then, that her father would throw no obstacle in the way of
1772110883
Rosamond's union with St. John.  Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young
-2068885584
clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient
586449392
compensation for the want of fortune.
-1267085256

-1923438341
It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.  My little servant, after
1121678650
helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a
823208988
penny for her aid.  All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor,
-1288808073
polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs.  I had also made myself neat, and
158330768
had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
-1833922138

-1923438341
The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my
230924882
palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
1899408842
occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.  The head was
-2114590548
finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to
791486460
shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl
1216640309
here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash
1205578748
under the azured eyelid.  I was absorbed in the execution of these nice
832543449
details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John
-1018424413
Rivers.
1395645187

-1923438341
"I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said.  "Not, I
874900694
hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
-1971569716
lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
-1397085880
wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
-940048719
he laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine
-964495570
productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the
-2033420668
golden age of modern literature.  Alas! the readers of our era are less
2145390587
favoured.  But courage!  I will not pause either to accuse or repine.  I
474360029
know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power
-306627135
over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence,
-634132432
their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.  Powerful
-976380060
angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble
1773256275
ones weep over their destruction.  Poetry destroyed?  Genius banished?
595946811
No!  Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.  No; they
-2077773477
not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence
-1326525078
spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
-2073143469

-1923438341
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
1696140728
"Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.  His tall
810315305
figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing.  I looked up at
-101510204
him: he shunned my eye.  I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
666466700
heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had then
481253046
temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination to do
1274126951
him some good, if I could.
-1628200523

-1923438341
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
-1922495841
too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses,
-1861306287
imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
1111540903
this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
-1884785791
him talk."
902941962

-1923438341
I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers."  But he answered, as he always
-500772297
did, that he could not stay.  "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
2080168897
if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is
-99741487
at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover
-2102096194
the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble
1707068193
breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy."
1815224867

-1923438341
"Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
449231753

-1923438341
"Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely."
720842991

-1923438341
"You did, Mr. Rivers."
1263958765

-1923438341
He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
-2145072000
astonished.  "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within.  "I don't mean
-1499637728
to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
-2132027183
considerable lengths."  I continued, "You observed it closely and
-1636954327
distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
1671862071
rose and placed it in his hand.
-285351278

-1923438341
"A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
40193003
graceful and correct drawing."
-89224826

-1923438341
"Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it
1470579523
like?"
-1566041465

-1923438341
Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
53637326

-1923438341
"Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
2034268617
promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
-8007291
picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I
1016019004
don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
1950801074
deem worthless."
1528081906

-1923438341
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he
-547434295
held it, the more he seemed to covet it.  "It is like!" he murmured; "the
-1132644199
eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It
-761427149
smiles!"
-735626182

-1923438341
"Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell
-559413618
me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would
-299702977
it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the
-1734406340
sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?"
-1470712074

-1923438341
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
-988663746
disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
-1791439419

-1923438341
"That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious
-293342058
or wise is another question."
-234991510

-1923438341
Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that her
2085359990
father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views
-195642979
than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate
-1958532760
their union.  It seemed to me that, should he become the possessor of Mr.
1254026270
Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with it as if he went
-1350111930
and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to waste, under a
1376868184
tropical sun.  With this persuasion I now answered--
-1018939314

-1923438341
"As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to
-1948200724
take to yourself the original at once."
-1614829833

-1923438341
By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table before
1229459480
him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.  I
-422056223
discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.  I saw
260342480
even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
-573621515
unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt
-859307449
by him as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.  Reserved people often
503997832
really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than
491649697
the expansive.  The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to
1643908557
"burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their souls
1579472540
is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
1035203543

-1923438341
"She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and her
997750375
father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless;
-1338860811
but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You
415721011
ought to marry her."
1293487726

-1923438341
"_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
-2127989385

-1923438341
"Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you
1694548937
continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
-1171319773
often."
-219193129

-1923438341
"It is very pleasant to hear this," he said--"very: go on for another
-1336090199
quarter of an hour."  And he actually took out his watch and laid it upon
-243458039
the table to measure the time.
-1862038828

-1923438341
"But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
1856255004
preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
1529829509
fetter your heart?"
-40407478

-1923438341
"Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
1867385595
doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
-1791451070
overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
-105552300
with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
-1914011442
intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a
1064067666
nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering
-132094711
them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
1088913432
Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
-308739597
her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
578404913
copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am
-478503645
hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say
1829078621
nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the
2085015234
time I marked pass in peace."
-688015170

-1923438341
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
2056999608
silent.  Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
-1281389175
the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
1658228271

-1923438341
"Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I
224736691
rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
733842443
voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was
836864625
burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her
926263917
promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this."
584576886

-1923438341
I gazed at him in wonder.
1076275664

-1923438341
"It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
-1338135590
wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of
1660956428
which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at
1668326443
the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a
-80580091
good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
1496745852
discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
-1754950791
rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know."
1397176983

-1923438341
"Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
-691692863

-1923438341
"While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her charms,
-531340919
something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such
-274407141
that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing
-215766586
I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond
-1844459944
a missionary's wife?  No!"
1123234897

-1923438341
"But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme."
-983089406

-1923438341
"Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on
193782492
earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band
-778727618
who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
-487024844
race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting
814199412
peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope
-1797247361
of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer
337331554
than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to
567687023
live for."
-1776004319

-1923438341
After a considerable pause, I said--"And Miss Oliver?  Are her
-1182709707
disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
2129768836

-1923438341
"Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a
2135069291
month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and
-1381206334
will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
2130256559
should do."
1985922223

-1923438341
"You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are
717888503
wasting away."
-327599205

-1923438341
"No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
254848891
unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning,
-718670776
I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so
-1799136349
long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come
1906958146
yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
-1074694228

-1923438341
"You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
-601846629
schoolroom."
-1755535104

-1923438341
Again the surprised expression crossed his face.  He had not imagined
521982650
that a woman would dare to speak so to a man.  For me, I felt at home in
-553780453
this sort of discourse.  I could never rest in communication with strong,
-784200684
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed
-398051899
the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of
-1402204350
confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
-250424265

-1923438341
"You are original," said he, "and not timid.  There is something brave in
338844308
your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure
909726986
you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more
-699446079
profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of
1446247295
sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade
-181980846
before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know
563873340
it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion
1283697873
of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths
1632024801
of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man."
-793820864

-1923438341
I smiled incredulously.
1573787390

-1923438341
"You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
-1231206861
much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of
-1871878149
that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a
582009233
cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the
691176325
sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my
816399377
guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more
1358317659
than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry,
1319549934
talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and
-786367815
mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I
-1646984308
consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not
408869881
because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you
1165265855
still suffer."
1183151735

-1923438341
"You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
-576738164

-1923438341
"No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
358079282
believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a
729702837
pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As
2125173938
His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I
1444765315
advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she
-1355433019
has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural
-1207439702
affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From
78210374
the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of
-1869247870
the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my
1084292908
wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom;
-1892849919
to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion
1654086903
done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning
-212627276
and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be
609299568
eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'"
-905610655

-1923438341
Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
1483586316
palette.  Once more he looked at the portrait.
-1493229710

-1923438341
"She _is_ lovely," he murmured.  "She is well named the Rose of the
-848115940
World, indeed!"
-128314289

-1923438341
"And may I not paint one like it for you?"
-911365813

-1923438341
"_Cui bono_?  No."
1479554656

-1923438341
He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
-1779015091
accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
1750587940
being sullied.  What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
2048506140
impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye.  He took it
1998217894
up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
110441353
inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed
2103401333
to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it
1003775647
traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.  His lips parted, as if to
627972370
speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
-1804104334

-1923438341
"What is the matter?" I asked.
-1260993650

-1923438341
"Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
939987552
him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.  It disappeared in
1873597319
his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
1557764494

-1923438341
"Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps the
1481448318
globe, however!"
1714133610

-1923438341
I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
1218789772
dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.  I
620754941
pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
805702353
being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
-1830219230
forgot it.
-1905042801

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXXIII
1635245560

-1923438341

-1923438341
When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
-1781665130
continued all night.  The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding
1992070863
falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.  I
593415521
had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from
1758397094
blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on
1826294783
the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle,
-1322203632
took down "Marmion," and beginning--
-1828726600

-1923438341
   "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
-1022369151
   And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
1533851625
      And Cheviot's mountains lone;
-1893134260
   The massive towers, the donjon keep,
-1735921927
   The flanking walls that round them sweep,
1759086719
      In yellow lustre shone"--
1134160831

-1923438341
I soon forgot storm in music.
-667327584

-1923438341
I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.  No; it was St.
1947136770
John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
-1416707737
hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that
-1952704684
covered his tall figure all white as a glacier.  I was almost in
713956983
consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
1847410298
vale that night.
-1221950020

-1923438341
"Any ill news?" I demanded.  "Has anything happened?"
848244655

-1923438341
"No.  How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
-1596472540
and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly pushed
1428357852
the mat which his entrance had deranged.  He stamped the snow from his
266440980
boots.
851714582

-1923438341
"I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
-1521645491
me for once."  Then he approached the fire.  "I have had hard work to get
-1029886717
here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the flame.
2093632192
"One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet."
222208964

-1923438341
"But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
-316471865

-1923438341
"Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
-2128641843
it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
-106159271
mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
711712555
the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is
1165693159
impatient to hear the sequel."
-1888554945

-1923438341
He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
1265451078
began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was
1887008512
a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
1888486377
handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did
1427501113
just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the
-965288268
firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved
-2117796925
me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
-271380458
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;
-1566081208
but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
952910728
It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his face.  A perhaps
876637178
uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say--
-1873313279

-1923438341
"I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
-656795545
you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
-657691749
health."
-2045924060

-1923438341
"Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now.
526573938
What do you see amiss in me?"
-1702012504

-1923438341
This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that
-488645714
my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous.  I was
653304502
silenced.
-88648414

-1923438341
He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
-2141927689
dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something,
-178268554
I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which
-618447368
was behind him.
-1299798802

-1923438341
"No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
-101587984

-1923438341
"Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
1895112403
alone now, and return to my book."
1320690378

-1923438341
So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion."  He soon
928039105
stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a
-957976980
morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,
815368534
folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to
2082540694
read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in
1645014932
impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk
1470036490
I would.
-1139991936

-1923438341
"Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
1066881804

-1923438341
"Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
-1103477136

-1923438341
"There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You
-1513660686
will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
-1136460708

-1923438341
"I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me."  Baffled so
-1913686987
far, I changed my ground.  I bethought myself to talk about the school
1342474079
and my scholars.
-528347922

-1923438341
"Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
481256272
morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
1056456467
Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow."
296282596

-1923438341
"Indeed!"
-354390993

-1923438341
"Mr. Oliver pays for two."
2116657410

-1923438341
"Does he?"
-1906880926

-1923438341
"He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
1704257532

-1923438341
"I know."
-5763828

-1923438341
"Was it your suggestion?"
-1166282637

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Whose, then?"
310608238

-1923438341
"His daughter's, I think."
-1605575415

-1923438341
"It is like her: she is so good-natured."
1332702246

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes.  It
-558985801
aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
1204291714

-1923438341
"Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
-127148238

-1923438341
Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
-134321626

-1923438341
"Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
2124348500
sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed
138667792
by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
1688071258
Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound
2080627388
somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree
387622349
of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether
794594887
trite or novel, it is short.
-273416390

-1923438341
"Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell
-1840500087
in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and
-2018903196
married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently
435640961
disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the
1829283637
rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.
1386621752
(I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge
-1405208440
churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown
-1583192909
manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its
442752929
very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I
-778230421
almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to
-542367286
the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-
-1999564581
law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did
1262042583
you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the
-387277797
rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it
-212003176
repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To
-443055901
proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or
1057695597
not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of
1506678596
that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than
1870137700
Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career
-972367262
there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like
-1396297656
yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history
295589434
and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were
1138806827
analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr.
-567403091
Rochester."
1029045029

-1923438341
"Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
1309483315

-1923438341
"I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
-945153407
have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I
-926284473
know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
1023448409
marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he
-129045073
had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and
-1526156872
proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
1543022332
transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
-1470895725
discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had
-2100283450
left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
-1910921717
been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
975276470
information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be
234291676
found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put
1609299909
in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a
1777305563
solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an
1279369176
odd tale?"
1944545161

-1923438341
"Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely can
-653601471
tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he
551562843
doing?  Is he well?"
138221635

-1923438341
"I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions
1120960120
him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.
925620188
You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event
-970073521
which requires her appearance."
1947099761

-1923438341
"Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
-833693024

-1923438341
"I suppose not."
785052661

-1923438341
"But they wrote to him?"
2105826892

-1923438341
"Of course."
-1900326469

-1923438341
"And what did he say?  Who has his letters?"
417095687

-1923438341
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr.
-1081819510
Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
-390802126

-1923438341
I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he had
-2019865654
in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to
-1405966339
some former haunt on the Continent.  And what opiate for his severe
-1052197668
sufferings--what object for his strong passions--had he sought there?  I
733651634
dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my
1646226318
husband--whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
-2066383228

-1923438341
"He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
-1162642777

-1923438341
"You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
-376337385
warmth.
-1851636194

-1923438341
"Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
1656672819
occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask
228561836
the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it
894467207
here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
-1709745601
down, fairly committed to black and white."
-1225395231

-1923438341
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
148523287
through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
-747545125
paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
-1757770181
ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
1258704598
portrait-cover.  He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
-4766041
in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work
1539254264
doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
-1523001064

-1923438341
"Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
392186735
demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my
-816281197
suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
1796699384
resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
-1978867775

-1923438341
"Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr.
-1780566485
Rochester than you do."
1697248140

-1923438341
"Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
-858676749
Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,
-1456102936
you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
-2033252518
Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you."
1393961309

-1923438341
"Well, what did he want?"
-1845977975

-1923438341
"Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
-747054264
he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely
-777780862
that--nothing more."
-322060350

-1923438341
"I!--rich?"
-621621192

-1923438341
"Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress."
952327993

-1923438341
Silence succeeded.
-1860865988

-1923438341
"You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently: "a
-948845968
step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate
455545580
possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the
462789788
will and the necessary documents."
-519785132

-1923438341
Here was a new card turned up!  It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
159448037
in a moment from indigence to wealth--a very fine thing; but not a matter
-22854843
one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.  And then there
-1990010057
are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: _this_
2001056651
is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its
-120057604
associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
1220722722
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a
-1999258594
fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business;
-155615063
on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain
98852563
ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
1687442524

-1923438341
Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
-1707613424
Death, Funeral.  My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever
-1498992441
since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one
251032689
day seeing him: now, I never should.  And then this money came only to
1496250574
me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.  It was a
-312686811
grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious--yes, I felt
-1802685950
that--that thought swelled my heart.
-501974986

-1923438341
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers.  "I thought Medusa
2138475610
had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you
1935139327
will ask how much you are worth?"
-1641470035

-1923438341
"How much am I worth?"
1752591309

-1923438341
"Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I
1920430139
think they say--but what is that?"
-56382992

-1923438341
"Twenty thousand pounds?"
690263631

-1923438341
Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
-764658754
This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had
469936735
never heard laugh before, laughed now.
-1137046489

-1923438341
"Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your
71597900
crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
-1240565122

-1923438341
"It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?"
963145286

-1923438341
"No mistake at all."
-1202743420

-1923438341
"Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!"
-1697687611

-1923438341
"It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand."
74082491

-1923438341
I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
64358519
powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for
1042533377
a hundred.  Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
-1824606659

-1923438341
"If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
1932222799
down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
-1859488464
alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I:
375024085
her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows.
715519617
Good-night."
17574960

-1923438341
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.  "Stop one
1595806148
minute!" I cried.
2002991569

-1923438341
"Well?"
799921855

-1923438341
"It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
464925272
knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
1931845297
place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
-542355357

-1923438341
"Oh!  I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
-1106376873
about odd matters."  Again the latch rattled.
303689

-1923438341
"No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
-93669439
something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
-2005058537
allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
-11682010

-1923438341
"It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
-1660698780
about it."
153874585

-1923438341
"Another time."
-1328324392

-1923438341
"No; to-night!--to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
252301725
myself between it and him.  He looked rather embarrassed.
1854756677

-1923438341
"You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
-565500526

-1923438341
"I would rather not just now."
-822952523

-1923438341
"You shall!--you must!"
-257215910

-1923438341
"I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
1309899953

-1923438341
Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified it
455718021
must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
1364374846

-1923438341
"But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
-991002249
persuade."
1196117469

-1923438341
"And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off."
-156124738

-1923438341
{And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg}
-1309929446

-1923438341
"And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
61716827

-1923438341
"Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed
-428100909
all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my
-608045908
floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be
-1199561970
forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
1967616511
sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
-2084672141

-1923438341
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
1203033228
perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must
371221259
know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?"
1610408791

-1923438341
"Of course: that was all settled before."
-1666221581

-1923438341
"You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was
-93185543
christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
665097477

-1923438341
"No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
-723662942
initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
-896880134
never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--"
2006131665

-1923438341
I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
-1532512996
the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a
331489715
second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit
-1941671848
themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
1678556078
lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every
1440609719
ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the
-816170889
matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect
1978902851
the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his
1910279623
explanation.
533863586

-1923438341
"My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
146849119
married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
-35124805
merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
114063857
solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and
-1712198196
to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
-799557656
orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
1860472973
forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since,
263743753
to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of
1165120955
her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find
1631944357
her out.  You know the rest."  Again he was going, but I set my back
-1479412153
against the door.
2084281390

-1923438341
"Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
-1265903556
reflect."  I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
-721428005
enough.  I resumed--
486711014

-1923438341
"Your mother was my father's sister?"
-1868358333

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"My aunt, consequently?"
-1814104565

-1923438341
He bowed.
448543470

-1923438341
"My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his
654048622
sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
-1249604884

-1923438341
"Undeniably."
1414938545

-1923438341
"You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from
784640419
the same source?"
-1264689571

-1923438341
"We are cousins; yes."
659385266

-1923438341
I surveyed him.  It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
-443258087
of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
-81189209
when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine
-1614858238
affection and admiration.  The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the
-68456562
wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House
1393302330
kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair,
-1343100355
were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found
-941442892
me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.  Glorious
-537012789
discovery to a lonely wretch!  This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the
-642987460
heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.  This was a blessing, bright,
-520798090
vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and
-1398482592
welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.  I now clapped
-759576783
my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
808486257

-1923438341
"Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!" I exclaimed.
-460720850

-1923438341
St. John smiled.  "Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue
-1195355917
trifles?" he asked.  "You were serious when I told you you had got a
-2071216924
fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
20511755

-1923438341
"What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and
1469770611
don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or
118771407
two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world
-1951268466
full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!"
-518498794

-1923438341
I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
2085514050
thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
1709731710
them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
330217600
long.  I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
-1609459014
stars,--every one lit me to a purpose or delight.  Those who had saved my
-551402030
life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
-18306276
They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could
318212665
reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
-473611192
theirs too.  Were we not four?  Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
-1122644829
would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would
-66873437
be done,--mutual happiness secured.  Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
1203905212
now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope,
-1542312086
enjoyment.
-1714223154

-1923438341
How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
1913884521
tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me,
781998455
and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.  He also advised me
-525218475
to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and
702187250
distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
-873940929

-1923438341
"Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come home
-91303
directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a
-1096317882
thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
-1750425434

-1923438341
"Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you must
-421278102
really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
-1740483486

-1923438341
"Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will
1992192276
it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down
100062125
like an ordinary mortal?"
1375024762

-1923438341
"You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in
1166803345
communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
-1056023108

-1923438341
"Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
1115636852
is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
-841014668

-1923438341
"Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
-216372880
comprehend better."
-2055285201

-1923438341
"Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty
-291693137
thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew
172946576
and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I
384553622
want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the
-2041425938
fortune that has accrued to them."
-417664042

-1923438341
"To you, you mean."
-1250666597

-1923438341
"I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
257146632
other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
902406185
ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I
1694754052
like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary,
309850509
and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and
962095250
benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me
744044778
to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice,
1060595862
though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely
1234415852
superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about
-1547653266
it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once."
380211864

-1923438341
"This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a
1244520870
matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
-12541483

-1923438341
"Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of
-1459149276
the case?"
-1224629166

-1923438341
"I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides,
-1802746955
the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts;
-286910617
he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all,
-447663289
justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience,
-1388747529
consider it absolutely your own."
-2038244644

-1923438341
"With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
1806993987
conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
-965185869
opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
-640810784
year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a
-1783710277
glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to
-9421281
myself lifelong friends."
-279269222

-1923438341
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
-1160950805
is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion
-2102682242
of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it
824868371
would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to
-538825851
you: you cannot--"
-1533107065

-1923438341
"And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
145549605
fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or
69704732
sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me
-837625941
and own me, are you?"
1161371174

-1923438341
"Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without
-1731528228
stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
874646112

-1923438341
"Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes;
1672577449
slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned
436969839
and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation!
-724509286
Close union!  Intimate attachment!"
-566690984

-1923438341
"But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may
-639122205
be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry."
634914591

-1923438341
"Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
634893729

-1923438341
"That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the
125810337
excitement under which you labour."
-1325791880

-1923438341
"It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
-1062185982
inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for
1028110509
love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
-780443403
speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien,
-1320032517
different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow-
2011809345
feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I
955021942
was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely."
742090657

-1923438341
"I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on
1089784960
what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and
-272534679
admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your
14968042
tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
-1509344246
agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found
-646544864
a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my
-125742262
heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
-641248065

-1923438341
"Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if
472621407
you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful
-374019408
scruple."
2075309883

-1923438341
"And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
-2004109882

-1923438341
"No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
-1743696033

-1923438341
He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
171643087

-1923438341
I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I
-2026363741
used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.  My task
431872565
was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw
1442606583
at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just
412354502
division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the
326383053
equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious
-2105648856
that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they
-1693146602
yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
1995938219
The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in
-855769821
my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn
950988147
out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.

CHAPTER XXXIV
-1396272393

-1923438341

-1923438341
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general
1968313721
holiday approached.  I now closed Morton school, taking care that the
474540253
parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as
1193690584
well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely
-1731056808
received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the
552824241
sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic
204023020
scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:
760965297
they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my
2006537163
gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated
-633659430
hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I
481292422
did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
-161558812

-1923438341
Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
-507078093
girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
863713490
my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen
1507139122
of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed
1701552750
young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And
534534930
that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the
1372270826
best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since
-1787443621
those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them
-619666726
seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton
-1809775462
girls.
434258546

-1923438341
"Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
-1726975618
asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  "Does not the consciousness of
-1493265255
having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
-1991356811

-1923438341
"Doubtless."
-852557064

-1923438341
"And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the
-661459268
task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
-531114763

-1923438341
"Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own
-845716242
faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy
-920938573
them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of
1275046894
it and disposed for full holiday."
835861939

-1923438341
He looked grave.  "What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
-1624183757
What are you going to do?"
-701309841

-1923438341
"To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set
1920357604
Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
68675423

-1923438341
"Do you want her?"
-1892023428

-1923438341
"Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a
-1640692579
week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
1600459869

-1923438341
"I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It
1060231567
is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
2028809819

-1923438341
"Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key:
673623983
I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
1625685203

-1923438341
He took it.  "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
-1812650447
understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment
2105609835
you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
1561926508
relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
2065993080
now?"
-2039043342

-1923438341
"My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
-2123240726
of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
1530704179
my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
-1565672270
cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table,
-992183708
bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to
282533280
ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and
1286282738
lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected
1801678635
will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of
268306772
currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up
1033534638
of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as
2081858941
words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
-578090856
My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect
-717799215
state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my
1477178436
ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come."
1080442327

-1923438341
St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
1972289985

-1923438341
"It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
-1417383805
that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
-437676364
higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
-932986008

-1923438341
"The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
-408932791

-1923438341
"No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to
-993756351
make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
278432253

-1923438341
"I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
323688427

-1923438341
"Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
464256177
the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
431682666
this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin
590513505
to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the
2014314929
selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your
-1079614691
energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
1250033086

-1923438341
I looked at him with surprise.  "St. John," I said, "I think you are
1648198792
almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and
1479368690
you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?"
650902164

-1923438341
"To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
-421430215
your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
-1131770840
account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of
-1349547986
that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
-1341324254
throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so
-560922044
tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
-607118984
adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you
695820523
hear, Jane?"
1314364808

-1923438341
"Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause
-764188877
to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!"
-1521702077

-1923438341
Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was
-1995019321
charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned
-1703803318
topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.  And
1729960023
really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
1123488295
delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
-493499052
I had previously taken a journey to S--- to purchase some new furniture:
556158157
my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I
-1732464648
pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary
-523832029
sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and
-869135403
Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,
-1931217170
and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest
1206844347
innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return
-307316144
the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new
-464540098
carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique
-58317949
ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and
1763799542
dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked
-1579781646
fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished
-1138773766
entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the
2005751171
passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought
-598255547
Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it
2066053798
was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness
1882731049
without.
-590582810

-1923438341
The eventful Thursday at length came.  They were expected about dark, and
374117441
ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect
-1524410887
trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
239615998

-1923438341
St. John arrived first.  I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
-922639419
house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
1339055162
commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed
-1267129084
to scare him to estrangement.  He found me in the kitchen, watching the
-1967728553
progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.  Approaching the hearth,
-1370627238
he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?"  I answered
-2132055248
by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of
-24044174
my labours.  With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the
-241563223
house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered
-136911349
upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of
185838305
fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so
2103226612
short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the
1159122794
improved aspect of his abode.
289558259

-1923438341
This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
-1345662118
some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:
761931444
no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
408045717

-1923438341
"Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
-1148467494
respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more
-1792998497
thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,
903684544
had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,
-978133573
could I tell him where such a book was?"
-1252818734

-1923438341
I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to
2049153564
his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
-746512007

-1923438341
Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began
1030050256
to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
-780818975
The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its
1205826387
peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after
-1153174930
what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor
-90995063
approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,
-834098337
still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I
-237785331
comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that
345309623
it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by
976237849
inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him
487429665
that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should
186032676
despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he
1401692425
should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever
-704928868
conducting permanently to his happiness or hers.  I saw he was of the
681149214
material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her
1436068733
lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great
1951088087
interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous
-1144591586
column, gloomy and out of place.
-679446657

-1923438341
"This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
-302339327
Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
1750875531
better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
-777470675
element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to
1621513762
advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is
-487109218
proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak
1223059376
and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the
1098900028
advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's
-570634017
career--I see it now."
849896577

-1923438341
"They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
-1561223978
parlour door.  At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully.  Out I ran.
749919679
It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.  Hannah soon had a
138483424
lantern lit.  The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
2029772228
the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.  In a
-1627385336
minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
-636413717
soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.  They laughed--kissed
854757128
me--then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
617700828
eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
-194835239
into the house.
1425921422

-1923438341
They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
-1508809072
chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
-2093904874
expanded to the cheerful firelight.  While the driver and Hannah brought
-463018207
in the boxes, they demanded St. John.  At this moment he advanced from
1175840826
the parlour.  They both threw their arms round his neck at once.  He gave
318277894
each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
-1512852191
while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
-628463559
soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
1512977077

-1923438341
I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
-285319073
hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
-1732208598
They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
-1257205399
with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
-849928158
they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.  I had the pleasure of
1245075292
feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
798436428
had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
-1533995732

-1923438341
Sweet was that evening.  My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
304860494
eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's
-1553732142
taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in their glow
953502245
of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise.  The event of the
1401923080
day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the
2133021061
accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of
-783427162
reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the
-649127716
very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap
-2022897686
was heard at the door.  Hannah entered with the intimation that "a poor
-1827084995
lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his
1753839113
mother, who was drawing away."
1966688657

-1923438341
"Where does she live, Hannah?"
-487185660

-1923438341
"Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all
-614425844
the way."
1831058708

-1923438341
"Tell him I will go."
-566013247

-1923438341
"I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after
-582986443
dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is
1757702581
such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send
-1655465109
word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
657163603

-1923438341
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one
116205650
objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not
1874441997
return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked
405550214
happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an
-1256287487
exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms
1376283496
with himself.
-1389165636

-1923438341
I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was
1081744574
Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort
1076385286
of merry domestic dissipation.  The air of the moors, the freedom of
818296063
home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some
1995799745
life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon
1240754744
till night.  They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,
112320178
original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and
-1911761379
sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our
1197781219
vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish
1996878878
was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in
-101315724
visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
-1899822476

-1923438341
One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some
-624619615
minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
-807754170

-1923438341
"Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply.  And he proceeded to inform
339804556
us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
120293226
ensuing year.
-1640413830

-1923438341
"And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
-1861064380
lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
-232905043
gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it
481400920
was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
-407019404

-1923438341
"Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of
-235473945
the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir
645686693
to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
-924764320
yesterday."
-1762061321

-1923438341
His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
895320634
he was serene as glass.
-495395396

-1923438341
"The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot have
-624904257
known each other long."
391788420

-1923438341
"But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where
-2139497817
there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the
1193808390
connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will
1485835465
be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them,
1824345963
can he refitted for their reception."
-1351558141

-1923438341
The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
1905018567
tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
1816589423
to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
1033231881
experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
1349282097
hazarded.  Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
-131885168
was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had
1468943589
not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made
1139597636
little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the
-1588364417
development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his
1321473431
kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance
1394906203
between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the
-1852684683
village schoolmistress.  When I remembered how far I had once been
-1108026251
admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present
886609798
frigidity.
622716107

-1923438341
Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
-789053782
head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--
-2037050291

-1923438341
"You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
-574945513

-1923438341
Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
-1159545577
moment's hesitation I answered--
1073835671

-1923438341
"But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
438869363
triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?"
1775815118

-1923438341
"I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
1856013139
called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is
1802486374
decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!"  So saying, he
-1924309157
returned to his papers and his silence.
-1326031283

-1923438341
As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into
-24650693
a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,
27056728
St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes
-1268043215
for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of
-1937318276
encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I
1015514892
fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some
-603014664
Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his
1671761629
plans.
-17411501

-1923438341
Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed
-1522381483
enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-
1137992111
looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his
1488200809
fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it
973505406
would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly
1460455504
to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual
442110279
satisfaction he never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me
790127513
of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more
-1560885739
was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or
1270402744
rain, or high wind, and his sisters urged me not to go, he would
-2097749838
invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish
1755649676
the task without regard to the elements.
202059509

-1923438341
"Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
-1464308059
can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well
1561828965
as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better
-503608492
calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
1310736245

-1923438341
And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
1243038787
weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
-174132294
would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse
208521518
was a special annoyance.
-1152153573

-1923438341
One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had
6952948
a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
2004108714
Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a
1667935661
translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found
1424029693
myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it
113516488
had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot
-1217575871
tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
-434102399
superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
378019139

-1923438341
"Jane, what are you doing?"
-1193751116

-1923438341
"Learning German."
1688957354

-1923438341
"I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
-1512710028

-1923438341
"You are not in earnest?"
863751825

-1923438341
"In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
-1061719969

-1923438341
He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
-56177673
himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
1390988075
the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
1680657073
whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
93438255
thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between
392942292
me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could
-721253217
sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I
-229672707
should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now
-298732177
barely three months to his departure.
-2014676837

-1923438341
St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
-1913527202
impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and
-734407922
permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found
-1789834979
her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both
-2087104833
she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to
-411480909
such a step.  He answered quietly--
-1286473380

-1923438341
"I know it."
108627139

-1923438341
I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:
-1779814824
he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,
309423769
he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he
-2078958728
acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:
573465189
his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I
718351461
could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely
-1292603163
importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was
-1407774401
distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and
785181229
occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain
2117116470
or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he
2104679641
said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I did it.  But I did not
1238218378
love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.
-934014534

-1923438341
One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding
-917884943
him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was
188561535
equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a
107090200
frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for
1555551446
hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
-866928384

-1923438341
"St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
431197155
her as such: you should kiss her too."
1684222635

-1923438341
She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
1555909016
uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
1371174287
John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his
786890992
eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such
2125769406
things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical
-2131559300
cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be
-563850525
experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed
1419470857
me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;
287410398
perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss
591456001
were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony
-953811024
afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,
199773543
seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
-593289842

-1923438341
As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily
1124898563
more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
249614528
faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the
-41644720
adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to
-1721744439
train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
-295612505
aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to
-1548219748
mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
1703112854
to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
-233336291
own.
-966481582

-1923438341
Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late
1272795903
it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my
693123382
heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
1826355400

-1923438341
Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
-405113615
changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with
-1853608681
me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
1017564131
sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
1062596948
tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to
270200338
know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,
-1303196260
I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor
545786461
House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
1724356538

-1923438341
In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
111780926
will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
-420443241
residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
-14905647
quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
1645687160
entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty
1314082643
on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
-154187136
answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when
644606281
two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought
-65174371
nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
1238804401

-1923438341
I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
-1670507070
Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
-456084623
weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached
-2140001777
me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and
-1419287107
then I felt dark indeed.
-174768310

-1923438341
A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer
236461361
approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to
-1071290520
accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not
-1370142511
want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
1273409996
purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
1092114995
deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
523872167
grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
-1923264554
never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.
1241210631

-1923438341
One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was
2062417355
occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in
572617510
the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,
1451097886
almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at
80451039
last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The
1792558392
bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over
1938217815
the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my
1300723050
eyes filled again.
1928510683

-1923438341
St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice
181175640
failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of
-2139967485
the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was
2146765214
gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My
-1868092955
companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me
-269417463
as to its cause; he only said--
1424684

-1923438341
"We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed."  And
137435748
while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
-1178410855
leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
2011629919
of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
-384599817
Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not
-1181351085
being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in
1362926695
completing it.  St. John put away my books and his, locked his desk, and
-1465713236
said--
-476569688

-1923438341
"Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
-1311487426

-1923438341
"I will call Diana and Mary."
1452918679

-1923438341
"No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put
651105
on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
1024211213
head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
-703532951

-1923438341
I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings
-779970325
with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute
1790172046
submission and determined revolt.  I have always faithfully observed the
-2097849952
one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic
1230163836
vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances
-253364672
warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful
-1062950325
obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the
-1802806505
wild track of the glen, side by side with him.
-2117065511

-1923438341
The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
310516218
of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
2095784014
the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
-1683489157
clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
-829293202
firmament.  As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy
890675470
fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and
658085130
spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us
1908464823
quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
-2126914914

-1923438341
"Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of
-790198667
a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
490881109
rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain
-1424477923
shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for
1747092879
gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh
-1151159836
for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a
1708447955
last refuge for silence.
-1952386608

-1923438341
I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down
1513736377
the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
-2038504185
traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let
-1580653353
the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with
622437409
the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.
-605508418

-1923438341
"And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by the
2082364911
Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes
973412951
me--on the shore of a darker stream!"
566457082

-1923438341
Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his
-1633385631
fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
-1922533485
me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--
136160699

-1923438341
"Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which
1270436089
sails on the 20th of June."
-1211720231

-1923438341
"God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
1596611621

-1923438341
"Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an
1736350683
infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
-529592780
the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,
1225361352
my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that
1486541489
all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the
371298775
same enterprise."
-1613359307

-1923438341
"All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
-334320219
to march with the strong."
-1912251426

-1923438341
"I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
464582014
are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
2077990844

-1923438341
"Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
618382395

-1923438341
"You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and
-1581645301
exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why
1660302541
they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,
1200588796
direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
1367313347

-1923438341
"If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be
-2014442899
the first to inform them of it?"
-1375961071

-1923438341
I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
1720153952
trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
-106996923
rivet the spell.
-1137699309

-1923438341
"And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
-1932727948

-1923438341
"My heart is mute,--my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
-883242413

-1923438341
"Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.  "Jane,
-1972027244
come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
1819689594

-1923438341
The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!  It was as if I had heard
-1829609906
a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of
-1591051466
Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!"  But I was no
306457154
apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.
-733067672

-1923438341
"Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
1887204931

-1923438341
I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
1276424326
knew neither mercy nor remorse.  He continued--
556358263

-1923438341
"God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not
-1114244611
personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
-183969334
labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall
719885210
be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
-894275993
service."
-1849114725

-1923438341
"I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
1510631563

-1923438341
He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
-705254515
them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
-1324030201
arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a
1066240424
long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last
-194785838
him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest
1595643337
for him.
-375939074

-1923438341
"Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
1199828578
say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,
1330597433
that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,
1761906539
for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself
1309772453
the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal
184377665
vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as
532127898
mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great
-901824225
task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the
-929237373
inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me.
-1654519974
It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will
-155666439
bear the weight of your human weakness."
-2098139547

-1923438341
"I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
-1745579706
labours."
-203348438

-1923438341
"There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
2008529367
your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to
-1833589851
moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers)
-1738322779
you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help."
2045216883

-1923438341
"But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them.
-125291968
Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light
1704289937
kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I
1539343922
wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
-1862383935
rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear
-52162407
of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
-1041074138

-1923438341
"I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we
-656966782
first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in
1759871313
that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the
2120392067
village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
-985116522
labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
-1985098516
perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In
-990165133
the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a
-929973954
mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In
-1637965900
the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares,
-1920766579
keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the
-221059757
claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame
-670666972
and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish,
2070490149
you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another
-1531336491
because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have
1415654408
since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with
475623844
which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the
-1201671343
qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested,
2063523686
faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease
-1298892981
to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of
-1862040568
Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will
1781849723
be to me invaluable."
-77798066

-1923438341
My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
2120665765
step.  Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
-242709011
making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.  My
-1309066810
work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
994994815
itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
-323886552
hand.  He waited for an answer.  I demanded a quarter of an hour to
-25289700
think, before I again hazarded a reply.
-1435958632

-1923438341
"Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance up
1819860514
the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
-66456796

-1923438341
{He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still:

754372789

-1923438341
"I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
-948173958
that," I meditated,--"that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is
627810804
not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?
1042608027
He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,
1794693985
in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very
1771809742
plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty
-1591338466
land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that
-1442051053
ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so
648935063
absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some
-1948577489
impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of
-1361045032
course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to
-750220662
replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the
-210308519
most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares
-1462421766
and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by
31790833
uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and
-1123079244
yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go
944792766
to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between
-563257379
leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I
-1997479250
know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to
535657195
satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the
1524123656
finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If
-894360443
I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it
-2001008186
absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire
-1023566959
victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him
-1904375140
energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I
-941138207
can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.
-734023596

-1923438341
"Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful
-1977810405
item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a
-1210778588
husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the
124326681
stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a
-1491364510
good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve
-2075536197
me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice
1016035939
his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the
-554835072
bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would
1682718278
scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I
70781693
bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice
1548865844
made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will
-1981431335
never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:
-653690864
I will tell him so."
685747967

-1923438341
I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
-131159277
his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to
1689757500
his feet and approached me.
-1845372959

-1923438341
"I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
-7928478

-1923438341
"Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
841478652

-1923438341
"You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let
-2014046421
us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
-1908008560

-1923438341
He shook his head.  "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you
-937112436
were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no
-1640275269
wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by
1377899905
marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to
1915879610
any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong
870414296
sense will guide you."
472553656

-1923438341
I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
-83633709
the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
-1863470824
therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  "St. John," I
659920704
returned, "I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us
-400295408
continue."
-2145651712

-1923438341
"We cannot--we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination: "it
-1080301312
would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you
-1551824386
have said that."
2044915123

-1923438341
"Conditionally."
-76058660

-1923438341
"Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the
-116081808
co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have
232321333
already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to
-1355057510
withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have
41811424
undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests,
1390253791
feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
-35901882
purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your
1149054073
great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that
1847449947
is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
1273858867
might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
-1052204877
influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
1474026417

-1923438341
I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on
-2067308161
my limbs.
-1391900252

-1923438341
"Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
1722443837

-1923438341
"One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell
-90146575
you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with
-1994563726
the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
769986081

-1923438341
"And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not
-238182919
myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For
1656388701
them he has no use: I retain them."
680297644

-1923438341
"You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half
-623394789
an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of
1890178284
God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept
2045391657
on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
-1289447098

-1923438341
"Oh!  I will give my heart to God," I said.  "_You_ do not want it."
1782010370

-1923438341
I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
-1985889797
sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
-2117719114
feeling that accompanied it.  I had silently feared St. John till now,
-1823313155
because I had not understood him.  He had held me in awe, because he had
1935324844
held me in doubt.  How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
886274059
not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference:
2048397912
the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes.  I saw his
1316814819
fallibilities: I comprehended them.  I understood that, sitting there
947270684
where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me,
969451175
I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.  The veil fell from his hardness
-1575492726
and despotism.  Having felt in him the presence of these qualities, I
1085791406
felt his imperfection and took courage.  I was with an equal--one with
211585104
whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
532152203

-1923438341
He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
640342081
risked an upward glance at his countenance.
-2100762209

-1923438341
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
1189875388
"Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!" it seemed to say.  "What does
128003303
this signify?"
261848302

-1923438341
"Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
-981375137
"one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I
-1965725040
trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to
2086328411
God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on
1357544030
your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth
2013482640
will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once
721176350
whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to
-87691340
your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the
1663661889
only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the
1575858431
destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor
-586412486
caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple
-26244235
about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
-288325320
inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
-1601551212

-1923438341
"Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
-934588612
their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
782840410
brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
-1126020478
searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
661749881
myself in idea _his wife_.  Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his
-1821425125
comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
1113983054
capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
-437236257
office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
1038866589
accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
-210691455
ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
-1744092249
profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer
-816517595
often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body would be
-519153944
under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I
681467676
should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved
1439539621
feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.  There would
1304227420
be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he never came,
-1789790006
and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his austerity
-1693447736
could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as
527211401
his wife--at his side always, and always restrained, and always
940456453
checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel
1050453086
it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame
-1822524866
consumed vital after vital--_this_ would be unendurable.
1900379700

-1923438341
"St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
-751999760

-1923438341
"Well?" he answered icily.
1362332077

-1923438341
"I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but
1252315902
not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
-699034264

-1923438341
"A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
1756379516
whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me
1109194652
to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be
1879105008
for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
2112154792
tribes--and unwed?"
-1459233564

-1923438341
"Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
-831099212
if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
-436324849
yourself."
-651573667

-1923438341
"It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:
38307292
to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And
545761439
for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's
14656003
heart and--it would not do."
-1315246767

-1923438341
"It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well.  I have a
-1665639221
woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
-1584040135
comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,
-1071531917
if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:
1479460156
nothing more--don't fear."
1562768709

-1923438341
"It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
978369947
want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,
1703236852
you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be
520998782
married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
902456333
love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
-490648785
eyes."
1837846147

-1923438341
"I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
749552556
stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  "I scorn the
-955227884
counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you
-372298467
offer it."
387234707

-1923438341
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
-1328261700
Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
1990195287
he could command his countenance thoroughly.
1421615478

-1923438341
"I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I think
-436473879
I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
-1727825221

-1923438341
I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
-1719433280

-1923438341
"Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
-216680242
been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on
-1138147111
which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the
1556278450
very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were
-1581718096
required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,
-1393652711
abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it."
1525165938

-1923438341
"No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can
-763564147
secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
-1926154292
To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom
-1317695550
I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that
-1257698245
space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject
-1321532016
it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a
1205036429
noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my
171569693
wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and
-747858939
barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with
-392648586
those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
1619456962

-1923438341
He had done.  Turning from me, he once more
1673775270

-1923438341
   "Looked to river, looked to hill."
-543086272

-1923438341
But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
1822712760
to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
1488530813
his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere
-2067311022
and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
1738352281
submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
-1319739018
detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
-1456559400
sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
-1861449021
obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
-1526975535
my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
-211938891

-1923438341
That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget
-389118054
even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,
1372943512
though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked
-1854441877
omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
131319366

-1923438341
"I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana, "during
1888940733
your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the
1327657363
passage expecting you--he will make it up."
-1290966125

-1923438341
I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be
-289309061
happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the
1314080873
stairs.
-96597223

-1923438341
"Good-night, St. John," said I.
-1605452028

-1923438341
"Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
76213086

-1923438341
"Then shake hands," I added.
1585236029

-1923438341
What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply
1177506894
displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor
296424982
tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no
811300247
cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and
-1462876577
placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was
-1775505811
not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had
-125311425
nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
-2095043168

-1923438341
And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me
994301862
down.
-482978506

-1923438341

-1923438341

CHAPTER XXXV
1698939977

-1923438341

-1923438341
He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.  He
-1573530900
deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me feel
1896075206
what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable
1545331294
man can inflict on one who has offended him.  Without one overt act of
-1251362049
hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me momently with
1388323301
the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his favour.
1441841301

-1923438341
Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not
-930272516
that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his
-1041357725
power to do so.  Both by nature and principle, he was superior to the
-2121181757
mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I scorned
-1887721081
him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as long as he
-1986956579
and I lived he never would forget them.  I saw by his look, when he
292246505
turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and
-1041545539
him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and their
-949401915
echo toned every answer he gave me.
-620672646

-1923438341
He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
-1242182899
each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
1878027668
him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in
1564882159
evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking apparently
1538564107
just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of
-654293500
interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere
-293713811
charm to his language and manner.  To me, he was in reality become no
500853410
longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his
452237347
tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
355350485

-1923438341
All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture.  It kept up a
-719072229
slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed
-1382752893
and crushed me altogether.  I felt how--if I were his wife, this good
-924046579
man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing
-1701371718
from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal
79666816
conscience the faintest stain of crime.  Especially I felt this when I
-2045553423
made any attempt to propitiate him.  No ruth met my ruth.  _He_
649959480
experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after
1922965357
reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
466126803
blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect
1669160958
on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.  To
-1384068165
his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid
-926472520
that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I
1033234083
was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast; and this I am
101569616
sure he did not by force, but on principle.
1468095068

-1923438341
The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the garden
-544754508
about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this man,
715403213
alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near
-1053537637
relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his friendship.  I
-990474038
went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the little gate; I
1617784628
spoke to the point at once.
-1934838445

-1923438341
"St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be
303064886
friends."
-342336059

-1923438341
"I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
-2103608403
the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I approached.
-705569756

-1923438341
"No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that."
-137951179

-1923438341
"Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all
1697244069
good."
1472207616

-1923438341
"I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any
-1118055045
one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of
1314663931
affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
-72475219
strangers."
-1224189479

-1923438341
"Of course," he said.  "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
1133100756
regarding you as a stranger."
-113744297

-1923438341
This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
-593733353
enough.  Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
-323036839
immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
-1826739364
than those feelings could.  I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
1653111206
principle.  His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
1295148419
severely.  I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
1921596304

-1923438341
"Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you
434927540
leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
-102179307

-1923438341
He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
-1377031320

-1923438341
"When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to
-1650690821
India?"
-350085480

-1923438341
"You said I could not unless I married you."
139571304

-1923438341
"And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?"
1989107053

-1923438341
Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into
-1419591347
the ice of their questions?  How much of the fall of the avalanche is in
940180506
their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
2146557652

-1923438341
"No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution."
1196830423

-1923438341
The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
-1296133708
crash down.
1098411360

-1923438341
"Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
1616419602

-1923438341
"Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
-2093539075
because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
-287475043
You are killing me now."
-2099617578

-1923438341
His lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
487062137

-1923438341
"_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought
-1499082818
not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an
-1658385599
unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
2043239640
inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
886248444
until seventy-and-seven times."
1685865510

-1923438341
I had finished the business now.  While earnestly wishing to erase from
-1237407047
his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious
1964131691
surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
-615240351

-1923438341
"Now you will indeed hate me," I said.  "It is useless to attempt to
1349835322
conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
-30225047

-1923438341
A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on
-395394187
the truth.  That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.  I knew the
-694710513
steely ire I had whetted.  I was heart-wrung.
476321804

-1923438341
"You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I
117304006
have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not."
856743824

-1923438341
Most bitterly he smiled--most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
-1437158946
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
1928915719
presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
-1299817649

-1923438341
"Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
201452062

-1923438341
A very long silence succeeded.  What struggle there was in him between
-1708805191
Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
1904785029
scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face.  He
595010698
spoke at last.
-457343288

-1923438341
"I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
-518494787
proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you
224403121
in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
-1803122109
again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your
567399233
sake."
-1345023493

-1923438341
I interrupted him.  Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
655188802
once.  "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You
-1722718087
pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked:
130368616
for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
1526980617
conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your
-1742989788
curate, if you like, but never your wife."
1471034139

-1923438341
Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
-1253962897
perfectly.  He answered emphatically but calmly--
-2139730668

-1923438341
"A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me,
-1905104188
then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
1399799728
will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
375333109
coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
-771557304
aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
173774532
promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
411632315

-1923438341
Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or
-616501276
entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and
1954118268
much too despotic for the occasion.  I replied--
-588911596

-1923438341
"There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I
666867858
am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
-643329924
strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
-363470451
confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
1549452301
when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
1905883459

-1923438341
"Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
198422183

-1923438341
"I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
1844806338
me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
139951611
Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know
-1973713755
for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by
1289787425
leaving it."
1809185609

-1923438341
"What do you mean?"
1431209659

-1923438341
"It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
1981827497
which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
1591647764
some means that doubt is removed."
-339114603

-1923438341
"I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you
1134564698
cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have
-1574517370
crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr.
1681069550
Rochester?"
1250941173

-1923438341
It was true.  I confessed it by silence.
-1285058711

-1923438341
"Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
166480637

-1923438341
"I must find out what is become of him."
1776605064

-1923438341
"It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
-1516637222
to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
-1681076474
become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
679849853
But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--"
-676251525

-1923438341
He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.  He
1021239402
was soon out of sight.
-376599685

-1923438341
On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking
965737950
very thoughtful.  Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put her hand
-629154055
on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
823166229

-1923438341
"Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there
-1178429738
is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on
1437613568
hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must
-971689951
forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly
1384559876
know what.  St. John is a strange being--"
1122343929

-1923438341
She paused--I did not speak: soon she resumed--
-51957251

-1923438341
"That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
-720758076
you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he
1522951100
never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he,
-359141816
Jane?"
-854138768

-1923438341
I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
1480022446

-1923438341
"Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently
1088539015
alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had
-1428340527
both concluded he wished you to marry him."
-1788229011

-1923438341
"He does--he has asked me to be his wife."
-295791588

-1923438341
Diana clapped her hands.  "That is just what we hoped and thought!  And
-978342031
you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England."
2007069123

-1923438341
"Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
1478265953
fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
1733334746

-1923438341
"What!  He wishes you to go to India?"
-1723228284

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"Madness!" she exclaimed.  "You would not live three months there, I am
2057931316
certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
109590870

-1923438341
"I have refused to marry him--"
-172824982

-1923438341
"And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
250628318

-1923438341
"Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him
99747982
as his sister."
1254725308

-1923438341
"It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you
-90850519
undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong,
-1960164843
and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to
-1278648966
impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the
-20857045
hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you
1816092856
force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse
-1434048631
his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?"
-1493534379

-1923438341
"Not as a husband."
-642630816

-1923438341
"Yet he is a handsome fellow."
-463456398

-1923438341
"And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit."
-2098185884

-1923438341
"Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
-886431942
to be grilled alive in Calcutta."  And again she earnestly conjured me to
553848983
give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
562003874

-1923438341
"I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
1269193701
serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
678005384
decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
2042640247
to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find
220280868
in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
-1224163957

-1923438341
"What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
1885615721

-1923438341
"You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again
987585168
explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He
1269860297
has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no
1183744628
doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
454424805
I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be
-1943831095
chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
1539658897

-1923438341
"Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!"
174117174

-1923438341
"And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
2121683601
now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
536816748
conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
-2002796407
because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
7725513
in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become
-829885133
unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed
-1761704264
the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity,
895959777
unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would."
1477105014

-1923438341
"And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
689718097

-1923438341
"He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
859918317
and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is
-1259087797
better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in
-1514565863
his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave
2135927063
you, Diana."  And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the garden.
285309925

-1923438341
But I was forced to meet him again at supper.  During that meal he
1815164577
appeared just as composed as usual.  I had thought he would hardly speak
895716808
to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
1652583448
scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.  He addressed me
-1587593946
precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his ordinary
1267721107
manner--one scrupulously polite.  No doubt he had invoked the help of the
124996306
Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and now believed he
879804142
had forgiven me once more.
-887811651

-1923438341
For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
-384727510
chapter of Revelation.  It was at all times pleasant to listen while from
-495823459
his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice sound at
-1719205241
once so sweet and full--never did his manner become so impressive in its
-1750544093
noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of God: and to-night
-746852755
that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling
1052966637
meaning--as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the May moon
-148090857
shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost
932542881
unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat there,
1607251247
bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision
-1520274071
of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell
-1732208292
with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised
-73560150
that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any
1767807758
more pain, because the former things were passed away.
-373366349

-1923438341
The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
-1705107616
as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
-526565082
uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
-704512480

-1923438341
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
-1903849744
he shall be my son.  But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the fearful, the
-1264834777
unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
1853035342
fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
1871096517

-1923438341
Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
1085269933

-1923438341
A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
-1747082634
enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.  The reader
-1541763203
believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he
-756665903
yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which the
-33923178
kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun
1023213203
or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the
1526198831
Lamb is the light thereof.
-590945039

-1923438341
In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered--all his
-1666354709
stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved
-1675961260
on a conquest.  He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance
703718506
for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for
1475617972
those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from
1674646537
the narrow path.  He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of a brand
2034257614
snatched from the burning.  Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as
1992071956
I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it continued and
-75507098
rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.  He felt the greatness and
-1867300608
goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard him plead for it,
91775652
could not but feel it too.
-1127790714

-1923438341
The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early hour
283276807
in the morning.  Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room--in
-1591397021
compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my hand,
-350202613
and wished him a pleasant journey.
-1079620292

-1923438341
"Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
-1741889600
fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I
-2132396114
listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me;
2132663872
but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do
-1345037190
all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I
1905763208
be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
589831802
repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work
508770129
while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
692734431
Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God
-763190273
give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
-766882693
from you!"
-1405366644

-1923438341
He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words.  He had spoken
724792949
earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
1351694231
his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
-478856826
sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
1689601104
responsible.  All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
-1419490878
whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be
1808665929
sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.  I felt
-1404320511
veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
65120441
at once to the point I had so long shunned.  I was tempted to cease
472340473
struggling with him--to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
790320410
of his existence, and there lose my own.  I was almost as hard beset by
290245596
him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.  I was
1029295482
a fool both times.  To have yielded then would have been an error of
1159772365
principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.  So
-2106358444
I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
1507464556
medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
-812528321

-1923438341
I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.  My refusals were
-1914517277
forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.  The
-1987146600
Impossible--_i.e._, my marriage with St. John--was fast becoming the
-504616488
Possible.  All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.  Religion
-806586964
called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a
-187956203
scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
-780500804
for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.  The
1926793463
dim room was full of visions.
340169300

-1923438341
"Could you decide now?" asked the missionary.  The inquiry was put in
-322133369
gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently.  Oh, that gentleness! how far
-53114247
more potent is it than force!  I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
734355195
pliant as a reed under his kindness.  Yet I knew all the time, if I
-1055674825
yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
823375515
former rebellion.  His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
-693508902
prayer: it was only elevated.
1685473734

-1923438341
"I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but convinced
-962310523
that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here
1190188274
and now--come afterwards what would!"
892215034

-1923438341
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.  He pressed his hand firmer
-117677712
on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm, _almost_
-983738473
as if he loved me (I say _almost_--I knew the difference--for I had felt
-1036309551
what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out of the
1355499139
question, and thought only of duty).  I contended with my inward dimness
-216244769
of vision, before which clouds yet rolled.  I sincerely, deeply,
518516363
fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.  "Show me, show me
-831712391
the path!" I entreated of Heaven.  I was excited more than I had ever
2024808019
been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
591129396
shall judge.
-254031108

-1923438341
All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
514873223
were now retired to rest.  The one candle was dying out: the room was
1979796611
full of moonlight.  My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
1394764762
Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
-1711834547
through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.  The feeling was
1108348611
not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
1718606533
startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had
-677762847
been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
-1747272053
They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my
1001672523
bones.
47937783

-1923438341
"What have you heard?  What do you see?" asked St. John.  I saw nothing,
-1910567766
but I heard a voice somewhere cry--
-1357974854

-1923438341
"Jane!  Jane!  Jane!"--nothing more.
-1949031994

-1923438341
"O God! what is it?" I gasped.
-766644484

-1923438341
I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room--nor in
447825572
the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from
191104025
under the earth--nor from overhead.  I had heard it--where, or whence,
-774252224
for ever impossible to know!  And it was the voice of a human being--a
-1355147225
known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester;
383608634
and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
757353938

-1923438341
"I am coming!" I cried.  "Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!"  I flew to the
982715126
door and looked into the passage: it was dark.  I ran out into the
-214592043
garden: it was void.
-1707761791

-1923438341
"Where are you?" I exclaimed.
-486359633

-1923438341
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are
-1081848429
you?"  I listened.  The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
476209002
loneliness and midnight hush.
1381731275

-1923438341
"Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
-917199320
black yew at the gate.  "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
-1394233849
it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her
-1120464039
best."
-902403267

-1923438341
I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.  It
289222731
was _my_ time to assume ascendency.  _My_ powers were in play and in
1391441036
force.  I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
1860432044
me: I must and would be alone.  He obeyed at once.  Where there is energy
2014892931
to command well enough, obedience never fails.  I mounted to my chamber;
-28033597
locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way
1937090593
to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.  I seemed to penetrate
-8706066
very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His
-122491143
feet.  I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down,
1514195
unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight.
639372229

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXXVI
-427380877

-1923438341

-1923438341
The daylight came.  I rose at dawn.  I busied myself for an hour or two
176993278
with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
2024480151
order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
-1658689117
Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.  He stopped at my door: I
-1388568681
feared he would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
1193433514
I took it up.  It bore these words--
-1631422219

-1923438341
"You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little
-731758320
longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
-740458987
angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day
2119786934
fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation:
1303890455
the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall
1637502094
pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN."
1642247524

-1923438341
"My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and my
1710981409
flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when
1479027604
once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be
-1574730430
strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of
1087552425
doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
-1598119285

-1923438341
It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
297180840
beat fast on my casement.  I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass
1577435960
out.  Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden.  He took
-719433137
the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he
-541650569
would meet the coach.
-1731083279

-1923438341
"In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin," thought
1551211099
I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and
1557090702
ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
-1581965008

-1923438341
It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.  I filled the interval in
-336370246
walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
711590143
given my plans their present bent.  I recalled that inward sensation I
-719837258
had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
-1064589356
strangeness.  I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence
-218000485
it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_--not in the external
1018885304
world.  I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?  I could
2139201896
not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration.  The wondrous
1808425013
shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations
-1685919975
of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell
432467560
and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it
-17061188
sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my
-646299953
startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which
1010825944
neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of
-919274666
one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous
-827895579
body.
-336309347

-1923438341
"Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
42405821
something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters
879410481
have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them."
1996526490

-1923438341
At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
300171872
and should be absent at least four days.
-1243249158

-1923438341
"Alone, Jane?" they asked.
353347503

-1923438341
"Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
1851884568
time been uneasy."
-349823944

-1923438341
They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
-753639502
believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often
685183623
said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from
825176732
comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to
-1047728368
travel.  I looked very pale, she observed.  I replied, that nothing ailed
1747640644
me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
-896014190

-1923438341
It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
484766600
inquiries--no surmises.  Having once explained to them that I could not
-1232391050
now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the
1955852956
silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free
1987789961
action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
1212810056

-1923438341
I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at
395182354
the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach
-726871038
which was to take me to distant Thornfield.  Amidst the silence of those
-1148514176
solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
2039671496
distance.  It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one
1352463063
summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and
-1328674945
objectless!  It stopped as I beckoned.  I entered--not now obliged to
-1170237386
part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.  Once more
71299433
on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
-215341249

-1923438341
It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.  I had set out from Whitcross
-459425712
on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the
-542617264
coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst
-33768277
of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills
646165285
(how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-
-480624271
Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once
382135216
familiar face.  Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure
-2041798000
we were near my bourne.
1822079844

-1923438341
"How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
-933496544

-1923438341
"Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
-2104608838

-1923438341
"My journey is closed," I thought to myself.  I got out of the coach,
1883212446
gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
-1731763164
it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening
-1052209572
day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, "The
602864575
Rochester Arms."  My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very
332160119
lands.  It fell again: the thought struck it:--
-724552176

-1923438341
"Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
763461967
know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
83420411
who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
426374999
with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost
-750598904
your labour--you had better go no farther," urged the monitor.  "Ask
-1563009341
information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
-1112958797
they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if
-989988730
Mr. Rochester be at home."
-683356509

-1923438341
The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
-266394692
it.  I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.  To prolong
-459656923
doubt was to prolong hope.  I might yet once more see the Hall under the
-957616194
ray of her star.  There was the stile before me--the very fields through
844400103
which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
-2058476997
tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
-822724955
well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.
2008669854
How fast I walked!  How I ran sometimes!  How I looked forward to catch
-1931270047
the first view of the well-known woods!  With what feelings I welcomed
-35173869
single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between
-969764906
them!
1239520170

-1923438341
At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
-934076615
the morning stillness.  Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
849103358
Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard
-34835630
walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.  "My
-2077073548
first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
-1460915504
battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out
-860490264
my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises
-2072682740
early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
1968081229
front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I
-1987460694
should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain.
-437273336
And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt
-732097728
by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps
-1992607320
at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
761822933
tideless sea of the south."
-332777144

-1923438341
I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle:
18908132
there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
-2085782566
pillars crowned by stone balls.  From behind one pillar I could peep
898541752
round quietly at the full front of the mansion.  I advanced my head with
-2072598575
precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
2021341890
drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered
-369247579
station were at my command.
-1831032975

-1923438341
The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.  I
-1370285875
wonder what they thought.  They must have considered I was very careful
1131313679
and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.  A
-1106936239
peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a
-63517124
straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the
1551341273
great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.  "What
-2076924333
affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have demanded;
-1990535841
"what stupid regardlessness now?"
-1407472862

-1923438341
Hear an illustration, reader.
812967600

-1923438341
A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
291363831
glimpse of her fair face without waking her.  He steals softly over the
919635744
grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses--fancying she has stirred: he
2047216467
withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen.  All is still: he again
-557172271
advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
-805407015
lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm,
-377291616
and blooming, and lovely, in rest.  How hurried was their first glance!
99107004
But how they fix!  How he starts!  How he suddenly and vehemently clasps
7493110
in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since, touch with his
-1958537073
finger!  How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden, and gazes on it
-708551870
wildly!  He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he no longer fears
1696586057
to waken by any sound he can utter--by any movement he can make.  He
-1255471985
thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone dead.
-982255811

-1923438341
I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
547406687
ruin.
2088680773

-1923438341
No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber
1701895924
lattices, fearing life was astir behind them!  No need to listen for
-1926223146
doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!  The
-1947710415
lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void.  The
-1896932797
front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very
-1619979630
high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof,
2127549598
no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
889788082

-1923438341
And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
836778761
wild.  No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received
1589265252
an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.  The
-1218528233
grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by
1388296769
conflagration: but how kindled?  What story belonged to this disaster?
-492158699
What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it?
406779264
Had life been wrecked as well as property?  If so, whose?  Dreadful
-1407340883
question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute
-1648882181
token.
106655732

-1923438341
In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
1088939989
interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
1938700700
occurrence.  Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch,
-891230344
winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
-118009972
drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
304501236
weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.  And oh!
363554344
where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?  In what land?  Under
81341674
what auspices?  My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
-829370692
near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the
1977186666
shelter of his narrow marble house?"
-1679926494

-1923438341
Some answer must be had to these questions.  I could find it nowhere but
1828125126
at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.  The host himself brought
1422801251
my breakfast into the parlour.  I requested him to shut the door and sit
-26382684
down: I had some questions to ask him.  But when he complied, I scarcely
-1206073602
knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers.  And yet
-1857558852
the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for
163958081
a tale of misery.  The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man.
-178833971

-1923438341
"You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
1592234693

-1923438341
"Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
1966241106

-1923438341
"Did you?"  Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
-1272322614

-1923438341
"I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
-327618931

-1923438341
The late!  I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
13412134
trying to evade.
-337174633

-1923438341
"The late!" I gasped.  "Is he dead?"
-546134808

-1923438341
"I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained.  I
-1164067138
breathed again: my blood resumed its flow.  Fully assured by these words
1139247293
that Mr. Edward--_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he was!)--was
1913245394
at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."  Gladdening
1051276892
words!  It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the
-663915491
disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.  Since he was not in
-564440429
the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
-1547690794
Antipodes.
342637712

-1923438341
"Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
1104999193
course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
1909968299
direct question as to where he really was.
-796980538

-1923438341
"No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a
-878550150
stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
-1933914327
autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
-1509300015
harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
-1873085363
property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire
-105332222
broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote,
-873863191
the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I
1800593738
witnessed it myself."
-998366391

-1923438341
"At dead of night!" I muttered.  Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
-1824392559
at Thornfield.  "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
42907278

-1923438341
"They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was
340925266
ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
-837150038
edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that there
-760655908
was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?"
-2093960792

-1923438341
"I have heard something of it."
595442785

-1923438341
"She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some
1114535623
years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they
49482094
only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
1945902527
she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought
-1011015231
her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a
-187521185
queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing."
378496682

-1923438341
I feared now to hear my own story.  I endeavoured to recall him to the
126368024
main fact.
-477535226

-1923438341
"And this lady?"
709918956

-1923438341
"This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife!
1284448656
The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young
-249568261
lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--"
-1842451018

-1923438341
"But the fire," I suggested.
528566499

-1923438341
"I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The
-1231653741
servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
-2136552327
after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know,
-1414269690
ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
-475289955
thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say,
-1398796862
almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
1764941559
house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was
-764731640
about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
-641229499
of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
2136455288
bewitched.  Well, he would marry her."
-705738501

-1923438341
"You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but now
-343334612
I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was
-333965912
it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?"
-591235675

-1923438341
"You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but
-163287715
her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs.
245137506
Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
-1471813581
fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a
-266532615
private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It
1678084151
is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous;
-1513193787
for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad
-443813356
lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her
-1839268430
pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house,
1316344023
doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly
-2050785481
burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However,
-699117123
on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her
-950180920
own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the
-750345085
chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew
674201478
somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled
486294113
the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The
1543266017
governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester
202448655
sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the
-311485087
world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite
1693927709
savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got
373693297
dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs.
-695446693
Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did
2090291586
it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she
644246976
deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was
-669409787
put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut
-632445820
himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
764414936

-1923438341
"What! did he not leave England?"
-1603803840

-1923438341
"Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of
-281189653
the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
741961358
grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my
879704961
opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was
354679898
before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He
-1689499195
was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was
368837020
not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever
727481861
man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often
-1311152368
wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to
1900909417
Thornfield Hall."
-48966840

-1923438341
"Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
-1414079909

-1923438341
"Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
1121462284
above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
1644157090
down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And
-440656471
then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
681857709
standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
5425457
they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
882854560
She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming
-985511797
against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more
-596114243
witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we
-785127837
heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she
488281145
yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the
1811745754
pavement."
-873555964

-1923438341
{The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement: p413.jpg}
676291150

-1923438341
"Dead?"
-1621845354

-1923438341
"Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
538385288
scattered."
1124001609

-1923438341
"Good God!"
-473669178

-1923438341
"You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
1806149851

-1923438341
He shuddered.
778344504

-1923438341
"And afterwards?" I urged.
-2096910084

-1923438341
"Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
-1054407786
only some bits of walls standing now."
-1680237593

-1923438341
"Were any other lives lost?"
-2000998238

-1923438341
"No--perhaps it would have been better if there had."
250297061

-1923438341
"What do you mean?"
1431209659

-1923438341
"Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen it!
-1234571637
Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage
612554025
secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I
190140192
pity him, for my part."
459123781

-1923438341
"You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
-1312994279

-1923438341
"Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
-1322070302

-1923438341
"Why?  How?"  My blood was again running cold.  "Where is he?" I
239232610
demanded.  "Is he in England?"
1786425920

-1923438341
"Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a
-1452376355
fixture now."
-2010610877

-1923438341
What agony was this!  And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
276979826

-1923438341
"He is stone-blind," he said at last.  "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
-1685846108
Edward."
817923664

-1923438341
I had dreaded worse.  I had dreaded he was mad.  I summoned strength to
-1183309667
ask what had caused this calamity.
392389636

-1923438341
"It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way,
1415284800
ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before
-1305667674
him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester
-600693289
had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all
133547234
fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a
-374626732
beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was
1572990878
knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to
1862645251
amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that
824861367
also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple."
-285866151

-1923438341
"Where is he?  Where does he now live?"
-1727361339

-1923438341
"At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
-1433795793
quite a desolate spot."
2022294919

-1923438341
"Who is with him?"
1413704699

-1923438341
"Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken
1433586288
down, they say."
2093909278

-1923438341
"Have you any sort of conveyance?"
-99847310

-1923438341
"We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
994204120

-1923438341
"Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
-1406336639
Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
-2036272718
you usually demand."
-1671749735

CHAPTER XXXVII
1118331264

-1923438341

-1923438341
The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,
-1717871413
moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.  I
-688118484
had heard of it before.  Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes
1933793361
went there.  His father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game
-1455859119
covers.  He would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in
1304347761
consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.  Ferndean then
-340257459
remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or
-2020889053
three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he went
1829544049
there in the season to shoot.
905398505

-1923438341
To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the
1118871973
characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating
-1355574406
rain.  The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and
-1344257546
driver with the double remuneration I had promised.  Even when within a
-1033246853
very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so
1732516528
thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.  Iron gates
1953297622
between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through
1597058308
them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.  There
-114428438
was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and
1157489097
knotty shafts and under branched arches.  I followed it, expecting soon
922663182
to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and
-1498652111
farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.
-42840330

-1923438341
I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.  The darkness of
-578721409
natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.  I looked round in
949474258
search of another road.  There was none: all was interwoven stem,
-2051930012
columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
1775776443

-1923438341
I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently
469566183
I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light,
171404190
distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying
-1054377297
walls.  Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a
17395004
space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
1865355305
There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling
1167664656
a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.  The house
-670143653
presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and
-1513458163
narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.  The whole
-1550605484
looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, "quite a desolate
-1643918180
spot."  It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on
1337277713
the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
-595913818

-1923438341
"Can there be life here?" I asked.
2116543250

-1923438341
Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow
-1578182036
front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the
-1577627114
grange.
-984800052

-1923438341
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the
-379240135
step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel
-800210551
whether it rained.  Dusk as it was, I had recognised him--it was my
-1330002574
master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.
366022910

-1923438341
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine
-1169421778
him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.  It was a sudden meeting,
2133362537
and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.  I had no
-247618039
difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty
-1646042421
advance.
-1188106257

-1923438341
His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port
210751255
was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features
-1623513310
altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his
1672204413
athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.  But in his
-418160070
countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that
600415134
reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to
1938185732
approach in his sullen woe.  The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes
1698985404
cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.
443121086

-1923438341
And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?--if you do,
-1296725473
you little know me.  A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should
607724132
dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly
1903479364
sealed beneath it: but not yet.  I would not accost him yet.
238497092

-1923438341
He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the
-117567112
grass-plat.  Where was his daring stride now?  Then he paused, as if he
-1593174469
knew not which way to turn.  He lifted his hand and opened his eyelids;
-50901978
gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the
102227649
amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void darkness.  He
991159020
stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one, he kept hidden
-1512262572
in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay
1495289962
around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off
869268497
where he stood.  He relinquished the endeavour, folded his arms, and
-477238647
stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his uncovered head.
-1418696713
At this moment John approached him from some quarter.
-583853073

-1923438341
"Will you take my arm, sir?" he said; "there is a heavy shower coming on:
-148906744
had you not better go in?"
-480714269

-1923438341
"Let me alone," was the answer.
-1375604988

-1923438341
John withdrew without having observed me.  Mr. Rochester now tried to
1580821182
walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.  He groped his way back to
1742429719
the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.
-194045997

-1923438341
I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.  "Mary," I said,
403335105
"how are you?"
98411384

-1923438341
She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her.  To her hurried "Is
-1941201921
it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?"  I
-1031788328
answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the kitchen,
-348783560
where John now sat by a good fire.  I explained to them, in few words,
-1415188194
that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that
-583886726
I was come to see Mr. Rochester.  I asked John to go down to the turn-
1144578240
pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I
504140356
had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I
1644063218
questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House
85777859
for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though
2057455687
difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.  Just
1795282584
at this moment the parlour-bell rang.
-822105905

-1923438341
"When you go in," said I, "tell your master that a person wishes to speak
-1195577327
to him, but do not give my name."
-1582993214

-1923438341
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
-769682825

-1923438341
When she returned, I inquired what he had said.  "You are to send in your
1643774534
name and your business," she replied.  She then proceeded to fill a glass
-1248531742
with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles.
827937334

-1923438341
"Is that what he rang for?" I asked.
1316620555

-1923438341
"Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind."
-1090999285

-1923438341
"Give the tray to me; I will carry it in."
1218445138

-1923438341
I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door.  The tray
-102984045
shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my
-680254374
ribs loud and fast.  Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
-1950683328

-1923438341
This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the
1023883068
grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the high,
2104427952
old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.  His
-465263325
old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as
1997300650
if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.  Pilot pricked up his ears
18357925
when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded
212423982
towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.  I set it on the
872019354
table; then patted him, and said softly, "Lie down!"  Mr. Rochester
337425824
turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as he _saw_
-1807978765
nothing, he returned and sighed.
-52249982

-1923438341
"Give me the water, Mary," he said.
966072641

-1923438341
I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me,
1336054700
still excited.
1408585969

-1923438341
"What is the matter?" he inquired.
-400217400

-1923438341
"Down, Pilot!" I again said.  He checked the water on its way to his
1485645142
lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down.  "This is
626482431
you, Mary, is it not?"
12731226

-1923438341
"Mary is in the kitchen," I answered.
-2141531999

-1923438341
He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,
-2112148364
he did not touch me.  "Who is this?  Who is this?" he demanded, trying,
1627411597
as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes--unavailing and
-172825965
distressing attempt!  "Answer me--speak again!" he ordered, imperiously
-2103274249
and aloud.
-1921444102

-1923438341
"Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the
1449493898
glass," I said.
948992913

-1923438341
"_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?"
374655375

-1923438341
"Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this
1920336408
evening," I answered.
1707320350

-1923438341
"Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has
719660059
seized me?"
-486167758

-1923438341
"No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,
-990100203
your health too sound for frenzy."
-841444738

-1923438341
"And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but
584191037
I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever
-34046659
you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!"
-1499817734

-1923438341
He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.
564863933

-1923438341
"Her very fingers!" he cried; "her small, slight fingers!  If so there
412585356
must be more of her."
1814611143

-1923438341
The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my
2119772443
shoulder--neck--waist--I was entwined and gathered to him.
-1009600251

-1923438341
"Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--"
183251053

-1923438341
"And this her voice," I added.  "She is all here: her heart, too.  God
1423116917
bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again."
-462966470

-1923438341
"Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre," was all he said.
1501508652

-1923438341
"My dear master," I answered, "I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am
-1740225826
come back to you."
109204663

-1923438341
"In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?"
557896692

-1923438341
"You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a
-535335226
corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?"
233021833

-1923438341
"My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her
-93986603
features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream;
1161412108
such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to
-1914445736
my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved
2078886442
me, and trusted that she would not leave me."
2136072650

-1923438341
"Which I never will, sir, from this day."
1199509466

-1923438341
"Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty
-1855203319
mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely,
1109078108
hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and
-630675761
never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will
-1572725482
fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before
-109279960
you go--embrace me, Jane."
-1878715500

-1923438341
"There, sir--and there!"'
135546896

-1923438341
I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes--I swept his
-1899959276
hair from his brow, and kissed that too.  He suddenly seemed to arouse
-1017724328
himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.
-1941076230

-1923438341
"It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?"
1887374717

-1923438341
"I am."
-885705318

-1923438341
"And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are
-1528133924
not a pining outcast amongst strangers?"
169457510

-1923438341
"No, sir!  I am an independent woman now."
235922866

-1923438341
"Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?"
516972923

-1923438341
"My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds."
-1012693731

-1923438341
"Ah! this is practical--this is real!" he cried: "I should never dream
-224984780
that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and
-607563960
piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into
-454991447
it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?"
1985668513

-1923438341
"If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close
791448926
up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want
331519664
company of an evening."
962184922

-1923438341
"But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look
-917277510
after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like
-1590202990
me?"
1612507100

-1923438341
"I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own
1170521254
mistress."
-1053133702

-1923438341
"And you will stay with me?"
-201652542

-1923438341
"Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse,
-1110296081
your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read
554540766
to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and
-870267005
hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not
1873399887
be left desolate, so long as I live."
215708770

-1923438341
He replied not: he seemed serious--abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened
-802389718
his lips as if to speak: he closed them again.  I felt a little
-60709014
embarrassed.  Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and
-1595695019
he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.  I had indeed
1512971907
made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me to be his
289838629
wife: an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had
-219633618
buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his own.  But no hint to
-1945460686
that effect escaping him and his countenance becoming more overcast, I
11451355
suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps
-971160300
playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from
1162052529
his arms--but he eagerly snatched me closer.
-555594695

-1923438341
"No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt
668178661
the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot
1990630555
give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The
1612804255
world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My
1741750188
very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly
424265398
vengeance on its frame."
-36218830

-1923438341
"Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so."
1873919671

-1923438341
"Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand
-145960520
another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and
1239710669
chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate
9551393
heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for
216568985
those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I
-216064906
should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
919771000
Come--tell me."
-1676501321

-1923438341
"I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if
1787515139
you think it better."
-1582563905

-1923438341
"But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry
935479288
one day."
-436992233

-1923438341
"I don't care about being married."
1488157730

-1923438341
"You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make
854054015
you care--but--a sightless block!"
1340479504

-1923438341
He relapsed again into gloom.  I, on the contrary, became more cheerful,
457703987
and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where
763613341
the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite
-947459130
relieved from my previous embarrassment.  I resumed a livelier vein of
41924737
conversation.
-1353489366

-1923438341
"It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you," said I, parting his
1440207748
thick and long uncut locks; "for I see you are being metamorphosed into a
-1540695322
lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar
-299842715
in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles'
-1150127203
feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have
-96216899
not yet noticed."
-451750537

-1923438341
"On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails," he said, drawing the
-95283357
mutilated limb from his breast, and showing it to me.  "It is a mere
1832874799
stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?"
-1869974198

-1923438341
"It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of
-392188447
fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving
-1711245925
you too well for all this; and making too much of you."
-799835383

-1923438341
"I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my
-1981828356
cicatrised visage."
-179875492

-1923438341
"Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to
940203595
your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire,
683544384
and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?"
-1110659515

-1923438341
"Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze."
-1054327865

-1923438341
"And you see the candles?"
-1904325733

-1923438341
"Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud."
-1440081321

-1923438341
"Can you see me?"
2024327757

-1923438341
"No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you."
-1689401519

-1923438341
"When do you take supper?"
-208519484

-1923438341
"I never take supper."
258648521

-1923438341
"But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay,
-38436608
only you forget."
1817481280

-1923438341
Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared
-171703900
him, likewise, a comfortable repast.  My spirits were excited, and with
-765006387
pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, and for a long time
-615254182
after.  There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and
-1357224531
vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, because I knew I
-1044879518
suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him.
602876249
Delightful consciousness!  It brought to life and light my whole nature:
-1743398348
in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine.  Blind as he
1934321605
was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his
1435005703
lineaments softened and warmed.
1541344904

-1923438341
After supper, he began to ask me many questions, of where I had been,
584636121
what I had been doing, how I had found him out; but I gave him only very
-80795139
partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
1481037262
Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well
-374677515
of emotion in his heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him.  Cheered,
1590532961
as I have said, he was: and yet but by fits.  If a moment's silence broke
-52346370
the conversation, he would turn restless, touch me, then say, "Jane."
-1799232080

-1923438341
"You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?"
375101442

-1923438341
{You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?:
-195485273
p422.jpg}
-519198406

-1923438341
"I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester."
66651660

-1923438341
"Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on
-155763652
my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a
-867079453
hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting
942750546
John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
638908514

-1923438341
"Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray."
-1575946065

-1923438341
"And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
-2117410667
Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for
1378643314
months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day;
-2045882832
feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger
-468847310
when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very
681725527
delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I
-1151697391
longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane
1124377386
is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as
-1570408664
she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more."
-949157225

-1923438341
A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his own disturbed
197906343
ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him in this
1785210763
frame of mind.  I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that
857777318
they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make
-1906875063
them grow as broad and black as ever.
1996079684

-1923438341
"Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when,
-1092659467
at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow,
855451877
whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards
-878064521
undiscoverable?
-1869033934

-1923438341
"Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?"
-935855432

-1923438341
"What for, Jane?"
1788798819

-1923438341
"Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming,
-60396331
when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am
618273447
sure, you are more like a brownie."
624470107

-1923438341
"Am I hideous, Jane?"
-695367634

-1923438341
"Very, sir: you always were, you know."
-1649902328

-1923438341
"Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have
1759412574
sojourned."
-2028433404

-1923438341
"Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times
-1461342392
better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your
-167964609
life: quite more refined and exalted."
1742026010

-1923438341
"Who the deuce have you been with?"
-1486869298

-1923438341
"If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your
1486406064
head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my
-1364497880
substantiality."
-1670803578

-1923438341
"Who have you been with, Jane?"
467737562

-1923438341
"You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till
1083896352
to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of
-1338274057
security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By
-2039547758
the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of
-513111756
water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried
1664019394
ham."
-369431603

-1923438341
"You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as
-1798766606
I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his
-1814554721
David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the
2069379783
harp."
-79150871

-1923438341
"There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have
128388016
been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good
-626365451
night."
130584908

-1923438341
"Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have
650428266
been?"
-843533494

-1923438341
I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.  "A good
-1555818201
idea!"  I thought with glee.  "I see I have the means of fretting him out
1167110780
of his melancholy for some time to come."
-1514015307

-1923438341
Very early the next morning I heard him up and astir, wandering from one
1393794188
room to another.  As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: "Is
1709941917
Miss Eyre here?"  Then: "Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is
7653018
she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down."
-350182915

-1923438341
I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast.
1246967923
Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him before he discovered
980174447
my presence.  It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that
-1208909487
vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity.  He sat in his chair--still,
685577213
but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness
-681518225
marking his strong features.  His countenance reminded one of a lamp
1568606782
quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas! it was not himself that could
1529426538
now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he was dependent on another
-545335312
for that office!  I had meant to be gay and careless, but the
920167886
powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I
730965140
accosted him with what vivacity I could.
669896804

-1923438341
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said.  "The rain is over and
-850380380
gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk
-1840000712
soon."
-1322652439

-1923438341
I had wakened the glow: his features beamed.
1024352292

-1923438341
"Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone:
-1525546715
not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over
-863486231
the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun
1722239171
had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to
698658211
my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I
-561888132
can feel is in her presence."
2126361952

-1923438341
The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his dependence; just as
1386267445
if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a
861740400
sparrow to become its purveyor.  But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed
1375924904
off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
734358380

-1923438341
Most of the morning was spent in the open air.  I led him out of the wet
2082199934
and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him how
1972366903
brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed;
640767994
how sparklingly blue was the sky.  I sought a seat for him in a hidden
572767181
and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him, when
-781785692
seated, place me on his knee.  Why should I, when both he and I were
1525308735
happier near than apart?  Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet.  He broke
177119007
out suddenly while clasping me in his arms--
-1908926657

-1923438341
"Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you
-335636078
had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after
1566753699
examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor
1227098149
anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had
1614945885
given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left
2119039049
corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What
391422892
could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did
-1201597684
she do?  Let me hear now."
-1700124630

-1923438341
Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.  I
-599805022
softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and
227636421
starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict
-784408895
unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart
335438267
deeper than I wished.
604270737

-1923438341
I should not have left him thus, he said, without any means of making my
1452290650
way: I should have told him my intention.  I should have confided in him:
-501715388
he would never have forced me to be his mistress.  Violent as he had
1162959177
seemed in his despair, he, in truth, loved me far too well and too
130667927
tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he would have given me half his
972896595
fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I
1977466560
should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.  I had endured, he
-1439096853
was certain, more than I had confessed to him.
-1438692852

-1923438341
"Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short," I
-656046564
answered: and then I proceeded to tell him how I had been received at
1725907952
Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &c.  The
1323029705
accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due
434215988
order.  Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the
147882067
progress of my tale.  When I had done, that name was immediately taken
1685468207
up.
1483098833

-1923438341
"This St. John, then, is your cousin?"
1408447373

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"You have spoken of him often: do you like him?"
-2146196397

-1923438341
"He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him."
1930904297

-1923438341
"A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty?
25792273
Or what does it mean?"
574739718

-1923438341
"St John was only twenty-nine, sir."
511315165

-1923438341
"'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature,
793492343
phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his
-1836624560
guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue."
-703625311

-1923438341
"He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to
1150837857
perform."
1494842855

-1923438341
"But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you
-257598854
shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?"
-779024431

-1923438341
"He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain
-864262197
is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous."
-1345175602

-1923438341
"Is he an able man, then?"
71389202

-1923438341
"Truly able."
-206306124

-1923438341
"A thoroughly educated man?"
1771765317

-1923438341
"St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar."
523545023

-1923438341
"His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and
-639345338
parsonic?"
1256267304

-1923438341
"I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they
-1037843585
must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike."
-999855456

-1923438341
"His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a
819017780
sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted
1608772810
up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?"
-1995662690

-1923438341
"St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue
-418998863
eyes, and a Grecian profile."
-1641137616

-1923438341
(Aside.)  "Damn him!"--(To me.)  "Did you like him, Jane?"
-1082233425

-1923438341
"Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before."
-616037028

-1923438341
I perceived, of course, the drift of my interlocutor.  Jealousy had got
1027431032
hold of him: she stung him; but the sting was salutary: it gave him
949334437
respite from the gnawing fang of melancholy.  I would not, therefore,
1569656204
immediately charm the snake.
645357315

-1923438341
"Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?" was
1964500448
the next somewhat unexpected observation.
756012469

-1923438341
"Why not, Mr. Rochester?"
1699656625

-1923438341
"The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too
-639744272
overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a
426260314
graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue-
-2049375542
eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real
1907705903
blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the
1546656711
bargain."
-87792119

-1923438341
"I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan,
1008021886
sir."
849990735

-1923438341
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by
866235613
a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a
-1437397343
question or two."  He paused.
-1967339054

-1923438341
"What questions, Mr. Rochester?"
-2021583281

-1923438341
Then followed this cross-examination.
-996178539

-1923438341
"St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his
561933383
cousin?"
-1867700766

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
"You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?"
1519242455

-1923438341
"Daily."
565110235

-1923438341
"He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for
-930996259
you are a talented creature!"
895555663

-1923438341
"He approved of them--yes."
-88360906

-1923438341
"He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find?
1830125769
Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary."
1402434714

-1923438341
"I don't know about that."
-433043222

-1923438341
"You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come
1168568435
there to see you?"
1674420531

-1923438341
"Now and then?"
-824684287

-1923438341
"Of an evening?"
-693364224

-1923438341
"Once or twice."
-1663119084

-1923438341
A pause.
527314172

-1923438341
"How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship
-1425142737
was discovered?"
1030702815

-1923438341
"Five months."
315154923

-1923438341
"Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?"
1953086628

-1923438341
"Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the
-278120367
window, and we by the table."
960182053

-1923438341
"Did he study much?"
1661473104

-1923438341
"A good deal."
-628565425

-1923438341
"What?"
353384197

-1923438341
"Hindostanee."
2100864233

-1923438341
"And what did you do meantime?"
-172627538

-1923438341
"I learnt German, at first."
-1168593785

-1923438341
"Did he teach you?"
-1054694885

-1923438341
"He did not understand German."
831949116

-1923438341
"Did he teach you nothing?"
-1411108714

-1923438341
"A little Hindostanee."
535270587

-1923438341
"Rivers taught you Hindostanee?"
545761357

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"And his sisters also?"
1428034766

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"Only you?"
-941812255

-1923438341
"Only me."
-1435314841

-1923438341
"Did you ask to learn?"
1333768185

-1923438341
"No."
-1213056381

-1923438341
"He wished to teach you?"
544572268

-1923438341
"Yes."
-2035920168

-1923438341
A second pause.
1352150558

-1923438341
"Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?"
-1932717145

-1923438341
"He intended me to go with him to India."
-564352338

-1923438341
"Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?"
-513003042

-1923438341
"He asked me to marry him."
-283852626

-1923438341
"That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me."
1438547428

-1923438341
"I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once,
-1733339633
and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be."
-128469517

-1923438341
"Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the
-1532175424
same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I
-1537969351
have given you notice to quit?"
-1113008984

-1923438341
"Because I am comfortable there."
157532272

-1923438341
"No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with
509359206
me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I
-484342309
thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even
-775358425
when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we
796504442
have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never
-1976830048
thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is
146043049
useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers."
-357506312

-1923438341
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own
-1870888062
accord."
969154305

-1923438341
"Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so
-517791565
truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you
176960163
have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--"
-752693553

-1923438341
"Where must I go, sir?"
-294877146

-1923438341
"Your own way--with the husband you have chosen."
1281551101

-1923438341
"Who is that?"
1442272359

-1923438341
"You know--this St. John Rivers."
-1959851530

-1923438341
"He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not
1732004521
love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a
-2044395263
beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because
-1189917333
he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would
-433768163
not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an
2025012414
iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near
1300769343
him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees
-847352376
nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental
-494690666
points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?"
-1115205389

-1923438341
I shuddered involuntarily, and clung instinctively closer to my blind but
831283431
beloved master.  He smiled.
-1001499742

-1923438341
"What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between
-792551190
you and Rivers?"
-1733420715

-1923438341
"Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a
-1329893117
little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
-1346039875
But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love
1085396319
you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it
-1506081422
belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest
-1031933854
of me from your presence for ever."
1949404266

-1923438341
Again, as he kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his aspect.
1792259186

-1923438341
"My seared vision!  My crippled strength!" he murmured regretfully.
2107050439

-1923438341
I caressed, in order to soothe him.  I knew of what he was thinking, and
965874273
wanted to speak for him, but dared not.  As he turned aside his face a
72618464
minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down
145719005
the manly cheek.  My heart swelled.
-439399539

-1923438341
"I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield
2053334322
orchard," he remarked ere long.  "And what right would that ruin have to
-1488146164
bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?"
-990705330

-1923438341
"You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and
-1330698654
vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or
-1034108017
not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow
-1154466876
they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength
972256434
offers them so safe a prop."
1478761199

-1923438341
Again he smiled: I gave him comfort.
1489204068

-1923438341
"You speak of friends, Jane?" he asked.
-1029007410

-1923438341
"Yes, of friends," I answered rather hesitatingly: for I knew I meant
2922259
more than friends, but could not tell what other word to employ.  He
415934236
helped me.
1672335115

-1923438341
"Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife."
1101859668

-1923438341
"Do you, sir?"
-803468563

-1923438341
"Yes: is it news to you?"
1477070876

-1923438341
"Of course: you said nothing about it before."
-666039033

-1923438341
"Is it unwelcome news?"
-1498035880

-1923438341
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
-1570594375

-1923438341
"Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision."
-811827960

-1923438341
"Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_."
333146539

-1923438341
"I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?"
1643557030

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?"
1578281844

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait
-1223319815
on?"
302114713

-1923438341
"Yes, sir."
765736706

-1923438341
"Truly, Jane?"
-1861096684

-1923438341
"Most truly, sir."
-244912008

-1923438341
"Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!"
280913245

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a
246238865
good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I
-371418476
wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me,
-719368594
to be as happy as I can be on earth."
381145143

-1923438341
"Because you delight in sacrifice."
-1949778412

-1923438341
"Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for
-1654258289
content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my
131441421
lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a
755057089
sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice."
397064047

-1923438341
"And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies."
-837433439

-1923438341
"Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be
1763490796
useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you
2130437769
disdained every part but that of the giver and protector."
-2120635320

-1923438341
"Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I
-1628074363
shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's,
-1344076880
but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I
-597562426
preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but
285187855
Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit
-1736881081
her?"
-192884978

-1923438341
"To the finest fibre of my nature, sir."
1659658145

-1923438341
"The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be
839935123
married instantly."
285696645

-1923438341
He looked and spoke with eagerness: his old impetuosity was rising.
1544042407

-1923438341
"We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the
612196507
licence to get--then we marry."
1581561576

-1923438341
"Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its
-966449949
meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at
-1853410410
your watch."
979394873

-1923438341
"Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no
-1882490693
use for it."
-1712621894

-1923438341
"It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel
1954975876
hungry?"
609603608

-1923438341
"The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine
-493119252
clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip."
-1436096032

-1923438341
"The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it
1970694303
is quite hot."
1030962727

-1923438341
"Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment
-342842634
fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the
-846749957
day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her."
-768456982

-1923438341
"We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way."
1077407709

-1923438341
He pursued his own thoughts without heeding me.
-2028247601

-1923438341
"Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells
2088423322
with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not
-91939747
as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more
1496450924
wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed
1439608109
guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff-
1071118669
necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to
-47592093
the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters
-1307907843
came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow
-1578208005
of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has
2009541401
humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it
-1121722249
now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its
161749975
weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and
-1333242083
acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse,
-1332963358
repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to
-1740760517
pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.
-332110172

-1923438341
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night,
1529393594
a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow,
29263628
sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere
-1500252039
find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between
1134827249
eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated
1513444817
God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this
-800311519
life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of
1310616140
rejoining Jane.
962288688

-1923438341
"I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it
2101578872
soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and
513553072
only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed
-2000470693
for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I
-2034175448
asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long
-2053194449
enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and
-562103750
peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I
-514500786
could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my
489447141
heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane!
-49311542
Jane!  Jane!'"
139292961

-1923438341
"Did you speak these words aloud?"
-403574494

-1923438341
"I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me
-870037726
mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy."
946947863

-1923438341
"And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?"
-186338858

-1923438341
"Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange
227913032
point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my
-1547764858
blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is
-2076363528
that I heard what I now relate.
-2004196450

-1923438341
"As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the
-414612864
voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait
-1429050897
for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where
-1194214184
are you?'
-512309856

-1923438341
"I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my
1158012679
mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is
1665943264
buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies
979035864
unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I
522164215
heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the
-1882400259
moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some
60978755
wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must
-69014749
have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane:
2117812824
perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were
1279508012
your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!"
248501971

-1923438341
Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received
-1504245059
the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to
-267882183
it.  I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in
1248345993
return.  The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be
1874544164
communicated or discussed.  If I told anything, my tale would be such as
-1175631334
must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and
1815901686
that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the
-2145377843
deeper shade of the supernatural.  I kept these things then, and pondered
20418463
them in my heart.
-2054506129

-1923438341
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me
-742145028
so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other
-1069252413
than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and
-1984489297
annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted
1691426072
before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank
-1689236737
God!"
-1691275894

-1923438341
He put me off his knee, rose, and reverently lifting his hat from his
2064763736
brow, and bending his sightless eyes to the earth, he stood in mute
-1818346154
devotion.  Only the last words of the worship were audible.
471503078

-1923438341
"I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered
502504183
mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead
-1708432630
henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!"
1518614790

-1923438341
Then he stretched his hand out to be led.  I took that dear hand, held it
1034126117
a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much
395837425
lower of stature than he, I served both for his prop and guide.  We
-273751112
entered the wood, and wended homeward.
89807819

-1923438341
CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION
691628350

-1923438341

-1923438341
Reader, I married him.  A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and
-198810511
clerk, were alone present.  When we got back from church, I went into the
1852436803
kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John
-1979317459
cleaning the knives, and I said--
-784351010

-1923438341
"Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning."  The
-1207387276
housekeeper and her husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of
1196624170
people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece
-1748916771
of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some
541510697
shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy
942103307
wonderment.  Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with
1124094438
which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for
1558607997
some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time
2056641098
John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending
-555780326
again over the roast, said only--
1988883794

-1923438341
"Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!"
-472534644

-1923438341
A short time after she pursued--"I seed you go out with the master, but I
116692417
didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;" and she basted away.
728470585
John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to ear.
-1488458276

-1923438341
"I telled Mary how it would be," he said: "I knew what Mr. Edward" (John
-1095257994
was an old servant, and had known his master when he was the cadet of the
1605033226
house, therefore, he often gave him his Christian name)--"I knew what Mr.
799946449
Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and
-1839313358
he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!" and he
822988974
politely pulled his forelock.
795663543

-1923438341
"Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this."  I
-1132992389
put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear more, I
-1983002783
left the kitchen.  In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I
-995573073
caught the words--
-1948143113

-1923438341
"She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies."  And again,
-142636984
"If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry
595886494
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that."
804873411

-1923438341
I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had
-1151866279
done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.  Diana and Mary
-178643358
approved the step unreservedly.  Diana announced that she would just give
-458139821
me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.
-1185797511

-1923438341
"She had better not wait till then, Jane," said Mr. Rochester, when I
-1438736459
read her letter to him; "if she does, she will be too late, for our
-2050337571
honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
-361122668
grave or mine."
1648542124

-1923438341
How St. John received the news, I don't know: he never answered the
184574369
letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me,
-516126278
without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my
-1849468356
marriage.  His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.  He
-1323245710
has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since:
645213904
he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in
682187042
the world, and only mind earthly things.
-1335531973

-1923438341
You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?  I had not;
-1369501175
I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her at
528629315
the school where he had placed her.  Her frantic joy at beholding me
-932944263
again moved me much.  She looked pale and thin: she said she was not
1360534413
happy.  I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its
936838157
course of study too severe for a child of her age: I took her home with
490585108
me.  I meant to become her governess once more, but I soon found this
-638586106
impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband
-118895975
needed them all.  So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent
-421240124
system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her often, and bringing
727902027
her home sometimes.  I took care she should never want for anything that
979013710
could contribute to her comfort: she soon settled in her new abode,
603973563
became very happy there, and made fair progress in her studies.  As she
-1293369160
grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her
-693603612
French defects; and when she left school, I found in her a pleasing and
662166908
obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.  By her
-1329051988
grateful attention to me and mine, she has long since well repaid any
1832325321
little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her.
-2073607547

-1923438341
My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married
1047725881
life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most
1355830790
frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
1297534321

-1923438341
I have now been married ten years.  I know what it is to live entirely
-2044268931
for and with what I love best on earth.  I hold myself supremely
-1137640446
blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's
-1848840076
life as fully as he is mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I
-749553334
am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I know
1470306384
no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than
1123135666
we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate
-965128428
bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.  To be together is for us to
-633791383
be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I
-610357419
believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and
1140284064
an audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his
-1920282067
confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect
841509722
concord is the result.
-1620391247

-1923438341
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps
1145753142
it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very
1669513823
close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.
427965256
Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw
-1604742540
nature--he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his
-1196279753
behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river,
-707158552
cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and
168071512
impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his
-1734011281
eye.  Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of
-1275324331
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished to
1776461201
be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most
-501760667
exquisite, even though sad--because he claimed these services without
1060197417
painful shame or damping humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew
1280933127
no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so
-1999776222
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
1626783168

-1923438341
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his
-1269304024
dictation, he came and bent over me, and said--"Jane, have you a
742642700
glittering ornament round your neck?"
2051764676

-1923438341
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered "Yes."
-1600570633

-1923438341
"And have you a pale blue dress on?"
1722666370

-1923438341
{And have you a pale blue dress on?: p435.jpg}
-286494381

-1923438341
I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the
2028679589
obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was
-405584967
sure of it.
702958203

-1923438341
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an eminent oculist; and
-1442277972
he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.  He cannot now see
1843531411
very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his way
-1486358242
without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him--the
-988822379
earth no longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, he
-469990622
could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they once
-75698527
were--large, brilliant, and black.  On that occasion, he again, with a
1139668318
full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.
-1210287387

-1923438341
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most
1993647318
love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary Rivers are both married:
-1292692385
alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
1727102726
Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good
-1916045762
man.  Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother's, and, from
-561919296
his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.  Both Captain
761884957
Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them.
-243369807

-1923438341
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to India.  He entered on
-1086939925
the path he had marked for himself; he pursues it still.  A more
306180699
resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
187853100
Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he
-1202833422
labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews
131814952
down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.  He
-80127289
may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but his is the
-354425493
sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from
195767889
the onslaught of Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who
118236491
speaks but for Christ, when he says--"Whosoever will come after me, let
1469239144
him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me."  His is the
-2027761228
ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the
1239825084
first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without
-1495941726
fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of
-207828977
the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
907686626

-1923438341
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself has hitherto
-1738550967
sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun
85502389
hastens to its setting.  The last letter I received from him drew from my
1730457314
eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated
953754982
his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger's hand
-1152228179
will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been
-1192786409
called at length into the joy of his Lord.  And why weep for this?  No
820055624
fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his mind will be
-938680807
unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith
2046691303
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this--
2034367813

-1923438341
"My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more
-1832375304
distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly
-104542543
respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'"

people in all walks of life.
-730749148

-1923438341

remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
367624031
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
118208012
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
1727949314
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
391046124
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
1780818583
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
1989600364
status with the IRS.
-1933247582

-1923438341
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
1103744956
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
-1271793261
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
-163751917
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
-485182338
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
-1243896160
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
-12330750
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
-1676232464
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
